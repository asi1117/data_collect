It feels like a mobile-game adapted to VR: Simple in concept, and with the ever-present annoying knowledge that spending a little real money would give you an advantage. That said, it's not a bad little game - it's a fun way to get in the mood for something more demanding. I wouldn't want to spend more than a couple of quid for it. It's very much a casual game - something you can dip in to for a few minutes when you feel like it.","May 5, 2020 at 5:33 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:25:17.479214,LeeoSeven,Fun & Relaxing Game!,I really enjoyed playing this. It provides some good excercise but not so much that you'll be exhausted afterwards. The graphics are nice & it runs very smoothly. I particularly loved the music. PLEASE CAN ANYONE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE ARTIST THAT DID THE SOUNDTRACK? I LOVE IT. Thanks.,"Feb 24, 2019 at 6:36 AM",5, 8,Thank you so much! Please write on games@vicovr.com
