2022-05-28 19:37:25.968155,TheLonelyDeveloper,Not even worth 1 star! HORRIBLE!,This is the worst thing I have ever seen on the Oculus store. I don't even know how it got published. Waste of time and megabytes. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!,Apr 14 at 6:15 AM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 19:37:26.014032,nightcat.mau,Fun!,"Honestly this reminds me of the cardboard and plastic 'pinball' games they put out for the holidays that you hold in your hands and it is that simple. Could use volume control, but it is fun even if it's on the simple side. It does work with Touch, just don't expect much other than what the demo shows and you should enjoy yourself.","Jun 27, 2018 at 12:28 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:37:26.029990,HiThere_,Very basic,"If you don't like pinballs enough to pay for one, this very basic one with it's lack of targets and irrealistic ball mechanics will do fine. However half the fun in pinball games is the ability to nudge, push and tilt, and this one doesn't provide that. Add more targets, add the nudging, pushing and tilting, allow the player to choose the inclination, and fix the mechanics... and then you'd have to put a price on it... At which point it is better left lacking, and free. 3-Stars because it's free.","May 17, 2018 at 9:28 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:37:29.126804,DevaxMangor,,"Terrible mechanics. Do NOT waste your time downloading it. Completely unrealistic physics and looks terrible. I appreciate that someone put work into it, but don't come out with a game that is a waste of time. It hurts you more than helps. Just keep plugging at it until it is decent. I would never come back and download it again. Wait until you have it done ""right"" then perfect it.","May 19, 2018 at 11:43 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:37:29.140767,Kill_Joy_DOD,,"The physics are messed up (the ball sticks to the flipper) and there's a problem using the touch controllers. If you rapidly press the left trigger button, it starts controlling the right flipper leaving the left flipper not moving.","May 11, 2018 at 12:14 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:37:29.155726,theconkerer,Fun For A Few Minutes,"It's ok for free, but I wouldn't pay for it at any price until they fix the physics. The ball doesn't feel natural. It sometimes seemed too fast, and the ball hugged the contours of the table as it rolled around the edges.  The table design was simple but I enjoyed the graphics. If the other games in the room were playable I think they could get away with charging a few dollars. All in all it was fun for a few minutes, but there are much better experiences out there for free than this one.","May 11, 2018 at 7:03 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:37:29.170687,savvito,simple but nice,This is a rather simple pinaball game but the enviroment is very nice ( i love how realistic are the arcades next to you. ) So i dont get why ohter people complain . Physics are nice and is good for a casual gaming,"May 12, 2018 at 9:24 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:37:29.185646,FastLawyer,It's free at least,"So this is rather simplistic. But if you don't have a VR pinball game, this is probably the best free one out there. You're probably better off buying Pinball FX or Zaccaria if you do want a better experience than this.","May 12, 2018 at 2:59 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:37:32.283433,duke1551,Duke1551,Down loaded the game and it does not work. Total waste of time but a nice idea. I will wait for the fix to come out.,"May 28, 2018 at 9:22 PM",1, 0,
