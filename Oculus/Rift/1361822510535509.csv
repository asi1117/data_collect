2022-05-28 18:24:50.508038,SwirlyMaple,Maybe the best $3 I've spent all year,"I got this on sale for only $3, and like the other positive reviews say, this is definitely a hidden gem. If you like these kinds of games -- driving challenges over tricky obstacles -- you'll be entertained by this one. The physics are both real and fake enough to make it fun and also challenging. The graphics are decent too. For $3 on sale it's a no-brainer. For $5-6 dollars I still say it's worth it.","Dec 21, 2020 at 2:52 PM",5, 5,

You have great graphic settings with first person view and different God views as well.
Really fun and challenging! 
Don't think just buy it!
Truly amazing!","Dec 31, 2019 at 10:33 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:24:50.536960,buchee,Fun game. Keeps me wanting more,The developer has acknowledged and fixed the issue for me. The physics feel a little loose and touchy but still an enjoyable game.,"Nov 25, 2018 at 11:55 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:24:50.551920,Paul_Blythe,"Good Fun, but flawed...","It's a Rock Crawling simulator with a big pinch of stunt driving thrown in. You can drive 1st or 3rd person, even change the scale to 1:5 or 1:10, making it feel like your driving a scale RC trail rig. With soft body physics, you'll see bits fall off and the body deform as you drive, bounce, jump & fall across the stages. 

Personally don't like the levels enphasis on stunt driving. Plus, the trail trucks deform to easily and act like they're to light weight, just bouncing about. Also, the mapped controls aren't the best for Touch... 

However, It is good fun from a more arcade perspective... with a few tweaks to the physics, and more trail based levels. This could be a fantastic game/sim.","May 19, 2018 at 4:54 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:24:53.653624,AronOskarss,"Fantastic fun, potential for Greatness","I love Simulation racing games, i play them daily when i can. the physics in this game are not great but still actually quite good and good fun i'm at level 15 and have had a blast, damage is a little exessive but propably for the simple reason that it's funny to see the cars bend and wheels flapping around.   it lacks a gear selection system and an actual brake, only forward and backwards is not quite what i hoped for.
forcefeedback is not good at all but playable for this type of game. 
hoping for a new version of this title someday with propper wheel, pedals and shifter support. online multiplayer would also be great ofcourse. thanks for a cheap fun game tho.","Jan 21, 2018 at 2:03 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:24:53.667587,M0n0LiF,Good game,"This is not a racing game it is a rock crawling simulator. it does this very well and it is very difficult in later levels requiring lots of patience and careful driving.
I have really enjoyed this game a lot and think its well worth the price of admission for all the content.","Sep 19, 2017 at 6:54 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 18:24:53.682547,cdroulers,Map editor is great bad physics too hard,"When you drive, the car doesn't respond well and even with a stripped down custom map, driving is too slippery. The physics are really bad to the point where the game is almost unplayable. It could be improved. Could be 4 stars if the game was free. The default maps are too difficult. The level editor is much better than the game itself. Beware, this is not a racing game.","Jul 3, 2017 at 9:46 AM",1, 20,
