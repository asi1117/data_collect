2022-05-28 18:43:56.763242,RuneSR2,A new VR animated movie reference,"With VR movies like Gloomy Eyes, Wolves in the Walls and Crow The Legend it's hard to compete, but Arden's Wake stands tall on its own. 
Note this is not a new movie, it's from 2018, and I have no idea why it has not been released before. This also means that the movie was made for oled hmds like Rift CV1. I tested the movie using Rift CV1 with super sampling (ss) cranked up to 2.0 with my GTX 1080, and I got solid 90 fps. The movie looks super-sharp and extremely much better using ss 2.0 than the super-blurry default ss 1.0. So remember to increase ss as high as possible! 
This is an emotional ride - I did get touched more than once. Even if its a seated experience, you'll want to stand up a few times to take in everything. Btw, using Rift CV1, I did not notice the SDE, in fact the SDE may help making some low-res textures look much more high-res than if you're using lcd hmds like Rift-S or Quest 2. Using Rift CV1 most textures looked awesome and had great detail. Sounds, and Alicia Vikander's voice, are awesome too and further lift this experience. 
I think this animated movie and Gloomy Eyes are now my favorite VR animated movies. If you haven't, you need to see this awesome movie!

Btw, just Revived the movie using Index res 200%, and it worked perfectly. Res 150% should ensure no motion smoothing kicking in at all with a GTX 1080 or RTX 2060, so system requirements aren't high. The movie looks awesome using Index, thus you do not need oled for this movie, lcd hmds are awesome too even in the most dark locations in the movie.","Feb 15, 2021 at 4:39 AM",5, 35,Much appreciated & thanks @RuneSR2 for the awesome feedback!
2022-05-28 18:43:56.778201,7sak,Definitely the best VR experience,"As a big fan of Pixar & Disney style animations, this beautiful movie just reminded me of those. Even more, it is VR! What it means is not only you can just look around, but you can even feel the air! You can hang around in the scene wherever you want, enjoy this masterpiece in your own way. Even if you watch the movie more than couple of times, you will keep finding the new aspect of what the developers prepared for you. 
Story & overall experience was even greater. Especially when you submerged in the water, you will feel like you are actually in the water with events going on outside. 
Definitely I would recommend another users not to just sit on the chair, but to move around, sit & stand, feel the entire scene as freely as you can.","Feb 15, 2021 at 7:55 AM",5, 16,Thanks very much @7sak for the review and feedback! Glad you enjoyed the experience!
2022-05-28 18:43:56.794159,TheVRPreacher,Absolutely Gorgeous (no Virtual Desktop),"Trying to write this review right after watching the movie is hard to do. There are so many things I want to say about it. I have a few main thoughts, if anyone's interested to read them before purchasing...

1. It's short, relative to normal, old-fashioned ""pancake"" movies. It might be 15-20 minutes long. I didn't mind at all. Honestly, maybe I'm getting old or maybe I'm changing due to being at home more, but I'd rather a SOLID 20 minute story than  a 2hr long remake/retelling/sequel/prequel. It was just the right length to be engaging for a VR pro like me, and short enough to be my new go-to when family comes over and I'm showcasing the best of VR.

2. The story is....beautiful. I'm not a ""creative"" type. But I can appreciate the wonderful story in this movie. Because it's shorter than most movies, each moment in the story was impactful. I was surprised at how real it felt, and how well the story was written. A lot of what the movie has to say is ""shown, not told"", and it's shown brilliantly. There are implications in the film that shed light on greater truths about this movie's world. 

3. Every single scene was spent looking around at all the detail. No way I caught it all. I'll definitely watch it again, as I'm sure I missed a lot. The attention to fine details really caught me off guard, truth be told. In one scene, as the movie was playing I stuck my head underwater, and it sounded just like it would if I was at that distance underwater.

--I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. Some people may think the $ is too much for 20 minutes of film, but it was well worth it in my humble opinion. The scenes are packed with detail, the story is very well told, and it speaks even when no one's talking. I want VR movies, 360 degree stories told and the audience is in the movie. Maybe one day I'll have the time for a 2hr long full-length VR movie. But for now, do yourself a favor and invest in this endeavor. You won't regret it.","Mar 20, 2021 at 5:39 AM",5, 4,"Dear @Haios, thank you for this absolutely stunning review. 

We appreciate you taking your time to write down these thoughts and share them with us and the world. We are glad you enjoyed Arden's Wake!"
2022-05-28 18:43:56.810116,wulf.schwarz,Magic Experience,"This is the way movies should be experienced, it adds a layer of immersion that sitting in front of a screen doesn't have. The experience is not very long though, about 30 mins, maybe the duration is something that could be included in the product details, but it's still worth the 8 bucks especially if you can share with family.","Feb 17, 2021 at 7:52 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:43:59.918802,Stephenal1,Only 5 stars because I can't do 6.,"Probably one of the most touching, emotional, and haunting experiences I've had in a very, very long time.  The best tales, I've found, are simple ones that are exceptionally well told in a compelling and heart-rending manner, and from the start Arden's Wake will not let go.  Technically speaking, it's perfect in its balance of resolution and optimization.


Thematically and story wise, it's going to reach in to your chest, rip your beating heart out, smile at your hurt, and dare you to feel otherwise.

The only downside is that I had to keep taking the VR mask off to wipe my eyes.","Mar 27, 2021 at 3:41 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:43:59.934759,SoakingRich,,"Why the hell would pressing the right thumbstick at any point,  restart the whole film with no confirmation. I have to sit through 20 mins with no ability to skip or fast forward or anything simply cos I thought there might be a menu/settings button that could make things less blurry? 

Pretty unforgivable for a VR film","Feb 14, 2021 at 11:30 AM",2, 6,"Thank you @SoakingRich for pointing out this bug to us and we're sorry you experienced these issues. Arden's Wake went through a rigorous QA process prior to release, but we realize we may not be able to address all potential outcomes, and appreciate you pointing this out. We aim to minimize performance issues and maximize viewers' experience.

We have addressed your feedback which will be incorporated into our latest app update and we invite you to retry the experience once the updated version is released. Please let us know if you continue to experience difficulties!"

2022-05-28 18:43:59.978641,P3ndulum,Decent vr experience,"After experiencing Alluminette VR ( from the same studio) I was eager to experience Ardens walk, I absolutely loved Alluminette still think about it today and show the VR experience to everyone, although Ardens walk is a good experience I wasn’t as moved or personally attached to the characters as Alluminette. The story even though it seemed “bigger” it still didn’t feel as moving as Alluminette.
I can’t wait to see what the studio comes up with next!!
On a technical note I couldn’t play using virtual desktop as I kept getting the crash report from unreal engine ( something like that) but I’m not counting this towards the review score.","Feb 20, 2021 at 2:36 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:44:03.079349,robojonny,"Beautiful, poignant VR short","A beautiful short film with great animation, sound design, and some of the best surface water I've seen. There's always something new to rediscover on rewatch, as the moments play out all around you. A great experience for people of all ages as well as a great introduction to the power of VR.","Mar 9, 2021 at 2:55 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:44:03.095306,Dave6871,Short Ends without explanation,"This is a short 30 minute animated film.  Being in 3D enables you to look around, but you can't interact or move at all.  The animation and acting are good, but there is very little story and it suddenly just ends without any conclusion to the story or explanation.  Is it worth $8?  Maybe, but go in with the proper expectations.","Feb 16, 2021 at 10:33 AM",3, 1,"Thank you for the feedback regarding your viewing experience. We appreciate hearing from you, and would be grateful to know more about why you couldn't move around. Are you able to provide more detail? 

We recommend viewing the experience while standing so that you are able to move freely and explore the environment (especially the lighthouse scenes and being above/below the water) and are adjusting the description to account for this."

I thought its gona be something wow after reviews mostly on 5 but im feeling , what? thats it ? and i paid for that ? well ... think twice before you buy ...maybe better just buy any other game wchich you can play few times at least .

2022-05-28 18:44:06.241889,Jasenm,Major performance problems,There is a point in the story where I have lockup and low frame rate. Intro is fine then once at the surface major frame drop outs and audio cut outs. Story freezes not sure what I did last time but manged to get past this point and the rest of the story played fine. Not sure the kids will sit through the start though. Using RTX 2070 and 4.6Ghz Fx-8350.,"Feb 15, 2021 at 5:17 AM",3, 0,"Thanks for your feedback, and we're sorry to hear you're experiences issues. We here at Penrose are all VR enthusiasts ourselves, so we also find performance issues to be unacceptable. However, we went through a rigorous QA process and tested on both Min Spec & Recommended Spec machines, and we have not seen the problem you're reporting. Would you mind sharing the specs on your VR machine so that we can rerun our tests? 

One note around performance relative to other VR experiences is that our real-time water simulation is quite state-of-the-art. You can see Penrose's  presentations at conferences such as Siggraph and FMX. If you're curious, our more consumer-friendly version of our academic papers on the real-time water sim can be seen in the GDC vault in the link below:

https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025500/Water-Simulation-and-Rendering-in

Despite this, you can be assured that Arden's Wake should be performant on Min Spec and Recommended Spec machines. If you share with us your machine specs, we will rerun our tests to confirm."
