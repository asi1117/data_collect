2022-05-28 17:27:32.585731,taylor_christopher,Necessary but needing a major update.,"I need this application
but its got such a terrible interface
I don't find it intuitive, and it won't let you browse other folders, just the one folder it makes in My Pictures.
I have hundreds of 360's I need to browse to check out
it is the simplest and fastest way once you get all your stuff in the folder.
Other apps are kind of a pain 
simple next previous 360 image with left stick
plays standard mp4 and mov h264 360 vids
sometimes just flakes out and disappears for no reason
Its the fastest way to browse a folder but the opening menu needs some user interface upgrading.
would be nice if it would view glb files like the home environments.

2022-05-28 17:28:10.624990,cybernettr,Blatant Partisanship,"360 photos holds some great views of some beautiful world locations. Biggest drawback is that, taken with 2-D cameras, they are not stereoscopically three-dimensional (but the advantage is that more people can share their photography). Another drawback is that some of the user submitted photos are not even full 360 degrees--there should be a way to weed those out. The computer generated 3D artwork section, however, is great! This app is a cheap way to travel both to real-life and otherworldly environments. I was offended, however, by the blatant partisanship displayed in some of the 360 photos, namely of the March on Washington and the one in London (from the Huffington Compost), but no 360 views of the 2017 Presidential Inauguration. The London march displayed an offensive sign calling the current president a ""vulgar pig."" Can anyone imagine such grossly insulting treatement of the former president being allowed on here?

2022-05-28 17:28:13.731681,Yeezplate,Travelling made easy,"I feel like this is one of the more underrated experiences in Oculus. Sure, still pics in a real world setting don't hold a candle to video, but in terms of VR experiences, the resolution of a 360 degree photograph is, at the moment, superior to video. 

I see people talking about the nostalgia and joy they get from Google Earth VR, but for me, Photos was a wonderful walk down memory lane. Being able to see, again, places I've travelled or ever being able to check out hotels or destinations I want to see or may see in the future. The photos that were shot professionally are so well done, you do feel at least a small amount of presence, and I thoroughly enjoyed the VR Artist submissions. I hope they will do more contests in the future.

All of that said, I do have a couple of problems with the app. First and foremost, it needs a robust search function. I appreciate the work put into user submissions, but the quality, and many times the subject of photos hold no interest for me. It becomes tedious trying to sort through user submitted photos to find gems that were shot professionally. Secondly, and not necessarily as important, it needs touch support. I know it seems silly, and I'm spoiled Touch user who ""Rifted"" for the first time (actually used VR for the first time) with the Touch. Life is so much easier when you don't have to drop your Touch and fumble around for the remote when switching between apps.

All in all, it's a good App and it deserves, imo, slightly more than the 3.5 stars it currently has. But so much of VR is about what you want to get out of the experience. If you're interested in seeing the world in the comfort of your home withouth the joys of the cultural experiences, this a good option.","Jan 2, 2017 at 10:59 PM",4, 3,
