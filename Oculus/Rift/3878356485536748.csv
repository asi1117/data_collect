2022-05-28 20:09:51.353100,Rick the XR4WORK Guy,Nice content and tool set,Anatomy Explorer 2020 has a nice amount of content and useful tool set but be ready to figure most of it out on your own. There is a basic tutorial as you start but i found many more features and ways of looking at content just by playing around with the interface and tools. See my overview of the app at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPivLudusITkFvxUMzu3SA,"Dec 9, 2020 at 3:30 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 20:09:51.369057,Cloakor,Incredible for learning Human Anatomy,"The software works great and it is very good for learning the human anatomy. I am an acupuncturist and work with the human anatomy every day, and this software has been amazing for helping me visualize the musculature and body systems of my patients. Now that all the features are implemented, this software is essential for anyone in healthcare who works regularly with the human body. I experienced one bug with the 'cut' feature where everything started glitching, but I reloaded the instance and it worked fine. I'm sure the developer will iron out all the bugs and I look forward to seeing this software evolve!","May 19, 2020 at 6:21 AM",5, 12,"Hi Cloakor,
Thank you for your review!"
2022-05-28 20:09:51.384017,gmarth,,"So far its a nice app, but there are a few things that needs a update in my humble opinion.
- Please add Smooth Locomotion. I hate teleporting and its difficult not to lose focus when exploring the body.
- More visible layers are a must have. Dev's told already they are planing to allow us 3 at a time. I think that's good enough and i'm waiting for it.

Anyway, if you want to explore the Human Body you will get a great App.

EDIT: Ok we need to grab the cut tool with the pointer and then use the trigger. Of cource i tried to grab it literally :) Thanks for your respone.","Jun 10, 2020 at 9:04 PM",4, 3,"Hi gmarth,
Thank you for your feedback! We will try to implement smooth locomotion into our app in the future. Regarding cross-section tool, you can cut in all directions. Grab and hold the section/cut plane and move and cut the objects in any direction you please."
2022-05-28 20:09:51.398978,Jack-Jones-,Simply Astounding,"If you've ever had an interest in anatomy or even ""just what muscle hurts,"" or curious about anything or definitely a student of the body, this app is for you.  Incredible detail and exploration, every single little part is described in text and named.  You can look at various views of the body, skeletal, muscular, lymphatic, you name it.  You can pull out the smallest parts and examine them close up.  Amazing, period.","May 8, 2020 at 11:54 AM",5, 10,"Hi Jack-Jones-,
Thank you for your kind words!"
2022-05-28 20:09:54.531183,alienware2016,Great but some tools missing UPDATE,"Update: the producers fixed the missing ant mode very fast. Now I can give 5 stars for this outstanding anatomy app. 

This is a very unique and outstanding app to discover anatomy in a way you have never seen before. Especially the ""ant"" mode is one of the main reasons I bought this. You can try it in the tutorial and it is overwhelming. Unfortunately this does NOT work in the explorer mode due to ""business license"" you need for that or due to performance? issues as you can read in the comment of my fellow user. So I can only give 3 stars because you do not get what you think when you read the description and watch the promo. As soon as this tool is available, it is worth 5 stars ++++++","May 16, 2020 at 9:10 PM",5, 4,"Hi alienware2016,
Thank you for your kind words."
2022-05-28 20:09:54.546143,shakingshaun,Great start,"The program does what it says and its fun to be in ant mode and explore the body. A few glitches. When selecting the female anatomy only the pelvis shows the rest of the skeleton dissapears. The detail of the brain is non existant. Cant select multiple systems to be shown at the one time  ie veins and arteries. Other wise a solid app. Looking forward to further improvements, keep up the good work :-)","May 22, 2020 at 7:41 PM",4, 1,"Hi shakingshaun,
Thank you for your review. 
The new update is on the way and should be ready soon. It will allow you to use 3 systems simultaneously. We are also working on expanding the female systems, microanatomy models and motion of the muscular system."
