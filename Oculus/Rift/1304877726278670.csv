2022-05-28 15:42:44.837129,ChadeUK,"Great fun, but...","I bought this on the Rift store not knowing that it wouldn't be available to play on the standalone Quest 2. I can still play it of course while the Quest 2 is linked to my PC, but was surprised to find it not in the library when I unplugged it for my wife to try it out in the living room. I find this a bit greedy of the devs since I bought it to play on the Quest 2 anyway.",20 days ago,4, 50,
2022-05-28 15:42:44.851092,Lucidmaster77,most fun you can have exercising,"One of the best games for the whole family including people who get vr sickness easily. as it has a comfort rating.  lots of flashing lights and music that can be fast or slower, easier or much much harder technical combo moves.  I actually purchased the Green Day and Lincon Park music packs, so awesome! so get this game and join in the multi-player Beat Saber party!",Mar 22 at 8:40 AM,5, 37,
2022-05-28 15:42:44.866052,Geoffrey2301,Refusal to Install,I had the game for a while. Baught every music pack and then one day the game became upresposive. Was directected to uninstall and then reinstall game but the oculus store refuses to install game and after a months now nothing has been fixed. Issue has not been fixed or refuded.,Mar 20 at 6:41 AM,1, 31,
2022-05-28 15:42:44.881012,RysfamOculus,"Great idea, huge problems.","Beat Saber is a great idea for a game, and 80% of it is well-executed. But the problems are many, huge, and utterly fixable. From inside a level, opening the menu takes four steps: wait through the horrific 10 second you-lost-animation (impossible to disable this, by the way), press the menu button, press the menu button again to close the Oculus menu, then click the ""Menu"" button on-screen. The score is exponential, so if you miss one block out of the first ten, your score goes from 100% to -- no, not 90% -- 60%. If some dev has a spare afternoon, you should consider play-testing this.",5 hours ago,1, 1,
2022-05-28 15:42:44.895972,horstmana,would be 5 stars but...,"Game is actually great but for the past few months I havent been able to play it.  One day the game just wouldn't work, I tried everything, ended up deleting the game and trying to reinstall and now it wont let me install it.  I figured maybe it was an update or something so I waited, months have gone by and nothing has changed, I reached out to oculus support today and they are reaching out to the developers because nothing they had me try works.  If the develpers can't or won't help they offered to refund the game and in-app purchases so thats something at least.  Like I said amazing game if it works, but pretty useless if not... good luck",Mar 28 at 9:44 AM,2, 10,
2022-05-28 15:42:48.013633,Ixonblitz,Amazing game,"I have spent so much time in this game it can be sad knowing everything I gotta do, this is so worth it the experience and the difficulty is unimaginable, there's competitive leaderboards with scoresaber(not included) that you can try if you want. It's a good workout and can tire you.the lights can be a little obsessive but nothing bad about it. Just remember to not use pcvr if you wanna play this game or if you want to, don't use rift and rift s, sensors are not the best on gameplay but quest is good",Mar 26 at 9:40 PM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 15:42:48.028593,02RISKY20,I use to think this game was good,"Howver the Level Editor no longer works and just comes up with a message reporting it is ""under construction"" with no real way of reverting back to the old version, additionally no support for mods",5 days ago,3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:42:48.043553,MakroneBiest997,This game alone makes VR worth it,"Title says it all. If this was the only thing available in VR it would still be worth it. Mods are a must tough, so you can play custom songs, as the true gems are in the community.",20 days ago,5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:42:48.058514,HarveyTAS,Beat Saber is a VR requirement,"UPDATED: Finally after 3 months my beta version of the Oculus app downloaded a new headset driver and now I was able to install the game. Didn't mean to punish the devs, but support was ignoring the install issues.  Game is awesome, but you knew that already.",Mar 24 at 12:01 AM,5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:42:48.073473,logchaw,A little disappointing,"Not only does it suck that the game doesn't transfer over PC and stand-alone Quest, but lately the phantom misses have gotten worse. I'm not sure how it's possible to play a rhythm game like this when it says you miss half the notes when I explicitly see my saber hit them.",Mar 18 at 8:16 AM,2, 4,
