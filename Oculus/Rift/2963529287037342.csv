2022-05-28 20:37:00.777424,RuneSR2,A new reference - simply looks real!,"Using Valve Index res 200% and Revive, this apps looks incredibly real. Even works in solid 90 fps using my oc'ed GTX 1080. 
In times with Covid-19, this app provides some calm and peace, and it looks so real that the feeling of not really being there is limited. 
The app also works great with my Rift CV1 using ss 2.0, but due to the SDE this app is better with a lcd hmd. 
There are several locations in the app, may easily take like 20 minutes to see them all, and you can also move more freely. 
This isn't just an app, it more like a place where you can go to enjoy nature and maybe even find some peace of mind.
Nice of the devs to provide this awesome app for free - it's easily worth $10.","Feb 2, 2021 at 9:25 PM",5, 0,Thanks for your positive and encouraging review! Luke
2022-05-28 20:37:00.792385,KammaKhazi,Enjoyable free experience,"Lovely relaxing experience with nice photogrammetry work thank you. I'm from the UK but have never been there, so I found it very interesting and especially nice at the moment with all the lockdowns and social strife. My only minor gripe (and for a free experience it's not really an issue) would be to have an option to suppress the giant blue circle and popping up messages saying to double press the trigger etc. Maybe if grip was held then they would be hidden or an option in a menu. Would then be a lovely space to just chill out or meditate in if that's your bag.","Jun 28, 2020 at 6:30 PM",4, 14,Truly appreciate your feedback and encouragement. Luke

2022-05-28 20:37:03.926002,Bob-Rolha,Good opportunity to visit an icy valley,"Interesting technique, using 3D volumetric modeling merged with real 2D images. Many image editing flaws, but which can be overlooked, considering the cultural and exploration purpose. Although it covers a very small area, it gives a good feeling of flight over the ice valley. My suggestion is that there was an automatic tour option to fly over the entire location automatically, without the need for control. My rating is 3.5 stars. Good opportunity to visit icy places, since here in Brazil, the little snow that falls in part of the year, is only in the south of the country.","Aug 31, 2020 at 12:44 AM",3, 0,Thanks for your constructive review (they always help us improve the quality of our experiences) - Luke
