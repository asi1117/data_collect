2022-05-28 16:00:51.688235,Machiventa,"Interesting game, could be improved","I really like the lego-looking graphics and the clamor of many enemies shooting at you altogether, while you doge them.  The screen slowly scrolls to emulate your ship moving forward through an obstacle course while the enemies are stationed, moving on ground, or flying in air.  It's a great concept and sometimes it feels real, as the stage is scaled to human size so you feel like you want to duck as the buildings come at you. I enjoyed dodging and moving through the course. 

However, I wish the scrolling could be slowed down just a bit.  I find that I don't have enough time to eliminate all the enemies; some don't explode until after multiple hits.  If my plan moved quicker it would also be more satisfying, but maybe that's something I have to build.  I think the enemy bullets should also be more solid.  They  seem to flicker and fade away and hard to distinguish from your own fire.  

Also, I'm a bit confused on the upgrade screen.  It takes a while for the ""ready"" button to be selectable and I don't get why that is.  After randomly selecting items, i can get into the game.  The game has alot of potential and I wish further updates would fix some of these things.","Jan 24, 2020 at 2:56 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 16:00:51.718155,VibrationsOfDoom,UPDATE: PLEASE port this to the Quest2!,"STILL one of the most amazing, beautiful and killer original space shooters EVER!!! 

WE NEED A QUEST PORT OF THIS!!!

It's nice to be able to use the link cable to play all the old Rift games on the Quest, but we should be able to download these to the Quest headset... Above all else, this is a game that NEEDS a Quest port...

Most of my reviews are updated to reflect this... There HAS to be some way to port games over to the Quest headset without having to lug a laptop or PC around with us! That's the point of having a stand alone Quest headset with tracking inside the unit, right???

Come on devs... I know this game hasn't seen a review in a loooong time, but let's show the Quest how space shooters are done!",Nov 16 at 9:08 AM,5, 6,"Thanks for the review! We are looking into transferring this to the Quest and see what can be done about it, once again, thankyou for taking your time!"
2022-05-28 16:00:51.733115,RuneSR2,Awesome game - perfect performance,"Great retro shooter, but still very original. You've never tried anything like this before! In another review it said that this game felt like being inside a Commodore 64, and that's a nice description, but it's probably more like a Commodore Amiga, although none of these classic machine even remotely had the power to make a game like Xion. I was worried due to another review stating poor performance, but I could in absolutely no way reproduce this problem. Using Oculus Tray Tool this game performed at a perfect 90 fps even when forcing super sampling 2.0! And that was using the ""beautiful"" cpu preset and no anisotropic filtering and no MSAA. Then I tried to more or less max out the game by adding 4xMSAA and forcing anisotropic filtering - and whoa - I still got 90 fps with 30 to 40 % headroom! (Remember I'm still forcing super sampling 2.0.) It may make good sense - this game is voxel based, and you can shoot the terrain too. Thus this game may be cpu intensive (I've got a i7 7700K, 16GB 3200Mhz), but it's in no way GPU intensive - the game should work flawlessly on lower end rigs (I'm using heavily oc'ed GTX 1080). Actually few games are as optimized on the Rift as Xion.
The game is great fun. You build your own ship and then shoot nearly everything that moves. Your right hand is your ship, so your ship follows your hand movements exactly. The left hand is used to monitor your health and to pick up items. The game works so much better than the great old arcade machine thanks to VR. Congrats to the devs for producing this flawless gem! PS. Should I criticize two things, then it would be great with an option to change hands - I'm left handed - and my settings (video and sound) aren't saved when I exit the game.","Oct 22, 2018 at 4:49 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 16:00:54.864739,vanfanel,decent retro bullet shooter,"The good. Gameplay and graphical style are really nice.  I really dig the retro vibe of the game. The bad.  Serious performance hit on my machine 6600K, 16GB, 1080Ti. The first level is fine but it starts going downhill from there. Lots of stutter and dropped frames with default graphical settings set to ""fastest"".  By the 3rd game is barely playable.  Other games worked fine and tried rebooting but the stutter remains. Perhaps a memory leak or something as the start of the game seems fine. I'll check back after updates to see if this gets fixed.","Oct 19, 2018 at 1:11 PM",3, 3,"NEW UPDATE IN PLACE WITH FIXES, PLEASE UPDATE REVIEW."

My Quick Thoughts:
I instantly got 'retro' Zaxxon vibes playing this game and also visions of 'Space Harrier'.
VR makes this style of game really enjoyable, entertaining and highly addictive to play. VR also adds bonus elements to the standard shoot-em-up genre and takes it into a whole new territory.
The ability to upgrade your weapons and build more powerful ships is the key to that ""Just one more go"" feeling.

SUPERB!","Oct 21, 2018 at 1:34 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 16:00:54.895656,statikregimen,Solid game w/ some bugs,"Update:
First of all, I meant to rate this 4 stars to begin with, so that's sorted.

Still some bugs remain, but the updates have helped overall. It's refreshing to see the devs care and responded to my concerns.

Original:
THe game itself is good and the overall idea is great. Just needs some bug fixes with the UI. I was on level 2 or 3 and somehow by undoing ship mods, I went from ~4k credits to ~9k credits. Or I'm flat out imagining things.

That aside, I've encountered other UI oddities. It can be hard to select ship items and I've seen menu text get cut off.

So far, nothing I can't work around, and the gameplay is worth it but I'd love to see some bug fixes...as a game dev, none of this should be hard to sort out - you guys are so close to a $20 game, it's not even funny! Do yourselves the favor!!","Nov 18, 2018 at 10:11 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:00:54.911614,KlodsBrik,Fast paced retro shoot em up feel to it.,"Just came across this title today on the Oculus forums.
Seeing how it reminded me of the good old c64 / Amiga shoot em up classics, it was an easy purchase to make.

Just played throug the first level to try it out. F1 starting in 10min. if it wasn´t for that I would have kept going !

Definately feels like a fast paced retro shoot em up. I love how one have to navigate through the enviroment using your whole body ( at least to get the best view of things ). Nice feel to how powerups are delivered, and it feels rewarding getting as many enemies as possible.

 So far this game deserves more than the low rating it got !

Will get back into this game soon for sure, and update my review by then.
 For now it will get 5 stars. Let´s see if this changes once I jump back into it. 

Oh, didn´t encounter any stutter or other issues. Ran smooth as butter on default settings. ( No SS aplied either ) 
My system:
GPU 1080
Ram 32gb
Ryzen x1700

Will also play around with settings once I get a chance.","Oct 22, 2018 at 2:02 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:00:54.926574,tidoust,Fun! Option to swap hands?,"Great game, I like the concept!

I'm left handed and would love the ability to swap hands so that I may control the ship with my left hand instead of with the right. Any way to add such an option?","Oct 27, 2018 at 7:12 PM",4, 0,"Thanks, it's coming in the next update!"
