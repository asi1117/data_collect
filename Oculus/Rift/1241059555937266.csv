2022-05-28 14:39:04.456745,poetofshadows,Just what I wanted,I was looking for something like this when I first got VR. I was happy to find it. I enjoy the different places you can explore and I had fun exploring the halloween fields during Halloween. I just wish I could save the scene when I add trees to the forest when I go back to it.,Nov 10 at 9:20 PM,4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:39:04.471705,VR4EVER,Very relaxing - if you let go,"To get that out of the way:
The graphics are mediocre, the animations are clumsy and its all very low poly for a PC title.
The sounds make up for the somewhat dated graphics, though.

That beeing said, if you manage to overcome those (sometimes immersive breaking) hurdles, you will be transported to a place where you can happily be on your own and in a very relaxing and calming mood.

I applaud the developer for building ""gray storm"" but there is something for everyone to sit back and enjoy. Its great to kick the rain in or switch to sunset atmosphere.


Nonetheless: 
when you've found your secret spot to sit down and relax, you will know why I gave it 5 Stars.","May 3, 2021 at 1:28 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 14:39:04.487662,Lost-Eagle,"Beautiful application, strange interface","A very beautiful app but I was really struggling with the interface. I was trying to rotate around without moving my head but couldn't find any buttons that could do this (funny, I thought an earlier version could??). Also I was trying to activate the icons that were around and above me but just gave up after a while. Moving around was good with the main trigger button but I really wanted to move continously forward instead of just hopping from place to place and I remember the earlier version did that. I wouldn't be surprised if all that functionality was there but I was at a loss trying to find it. I think people unfamiliar with Virtual Reality would have a lot of trouble figuring out how to move around.","Nov 20, 2020 at 8:24 AM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 14:39:07.626393,Iguanas_GR,Delivers what its promise,"Beautiful and relaxing.

Just 2 recos for the developers.

1. Make the movement adjustable with the trigger. It kinda breaks the experience when it has a fixed speed
2. The menu with the trees and the light and stuff expands all the way to my back. It would be more user friendly if everything was in front of me and dont have to turn back. If im sitting on a chair is kinda annoying.","Apr 21, 2020 at 4:18 AM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 14:39:07.641353,xGothicPunkGirlx,Beautiful. Relaxing. Free.,I use this wonderful game to meditate and relax. Sometimes just think about everything and sometimes to think about nothing. Weather effects and control over them. Real time lighting. The ability to move within and interact with the locations.  Tranquil and peaceful.  Can't recommend this enough. VR isn't just for gaming.  I hope everyone enjoys this gem like I do.   6/5 stars imho.  Best Meditation and relaxing experience on any platform imho and at a very fair price!,"Dec 15, 2019 at 12:19 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:39:10.806516,evertec,Great! But...,"Overall a fantastic experience. There's one thing that really breaks the relaxation for me though and that's the lack of any type of slow movements. When you press the trigger to move forward, it's either a jolt forward or not moving at all. It despirately needs a way to let you half hold the trigger to slowly move at the relaxing pace you want to move in.","Jul 7, 2019 at 10:56 PM",4, 12,

2022-05-28 14:39:10.835438,ThaDip,It is ok but...,"It is not very bad but I did not get relaxed. The sounds are to sharp/harsch(?) (I don't mean the volume ...hard to explaine. English is not my native language)
They hurt my ears. Also the graphics are ok. Wish it would be better.
Animals do move a bit awkward and the tree movement is weird.

Something I would absolutly love is an option to sit by the water and just splash it around or slowly make it move just the way real life how water moves.
Interaction with the animals. Now they just walk towards me and push me aside...not very pleasant.

I am keeping the game and hope the maker is going to read the negative feedbacks and improve the game.

This is in the good direction but please improve.","Jun 14, 2019 at 6:17 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 14:39:10.851396,myrrh404,,"Beautiful scenes, love the animals, this is a truly excellent game/sim/experience. I actually didn't expect to get this much when I bought it, how great to be surprised by a game that over-delivers.
Some suggestions that you might want to consider if/when you add/update: 
1. Sometimes the POV seems too high up. I'm not sure the average person looks down on an elk ... Perhaps an option to lower/raise eye-level, unless you were going for the idea of the POV being super-tall. That's a minor thing anyway.
2. An option to control the volume (music and SFX) from within the game while playing. This I'd really appreciate.
3. The ability to import your own tunes would be nice.
4. As another reviewer mentioned, you could always add a few more scenes - we wouldn't complain :) 

Anyway, Thanks for such a great game!","Jun 8, 2019 at 8:26 AM",5, 5,

Not only is it quite beautiful, but I like being able to grow trees, flowers, change from day to night, etc. etc.  Lots to do here. But...one plea! PLEASE make some more scenes!! I've already played through the ones you have but am hungry for more. One thing I like is that the animals are sometimes a surprise. That is, not always in the same place, and sometimes different ones as well. I can see you put a lot of time and work into this and it remains one of my most favorite programs. Please make more!!

A few things I wish were different.
-You should be able to enable smooth turning instead of snap turning. Also maybe be able to change movement from where your head is facing to where your controller is facing.

Perhaps a little more interactivity. 
-You can walk right through animals and they do not acknowldge you at all. 
 -Perhaps the ability to pick up rocks and other objects. 
-Maybe add the ability to play seated so you can just sit on the beach.  
-Be able to play your own relaxing music in-game? Or instead of simply being able to turn the in game music on/off, add a volume control
-Multiplayer with friends!","Feb 26, 2019 at 12:53 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 14:39:13.977183,edostmann,"OK effort, cheap delivery","None of the environments had a relaxing effect on me, but with their low poly models, amateur animations and annoying sounds they were rather spooky or terrifying.

It's all ambitious and surely well meant. I like that the areas to explore are somewhat larger. The idea of being able to influence the environments in various ways is a good start. Changing the time of day and weather effects is interesting in theory. 

However the whole delivery is lacking important aspects of quality. It's fair to mention that there are several well made free steam VR environments out there, that are offering far more polished experiences. 

The number of places to go seems ok, but at a closer look they are all composed of the same models only with different lighting and colors, with a few exeptions.

The animation of branches and tree leafs, supposedly 'shaken by wind', just looks strange. Some mammal animations look hilariously silly. The ambience sounds are mixed without sensibility. Every sound loop screams at you at full power without much variation. It's like they just kept the very first rough draft of sounds and moved on. Teleportation makes sounds to be suddenly cut. Birds are screaming in your ear without pause when approaching certain trees. Mammals scream and roar in continuous short loops without mercy - never pausing! Some rare sounds seem to have a very low resolution and make you think your headphones are broken.","Mar 15, 2019 at 5:52 AM",1, 3,"Hello, it's always a terrible sinking feeling to get a 1 star review especially when you seem to like the concept. Nature Treks has had a a huge amount of time, effort and consideration spent on it over a 2 year period with many updates in that time. We always try to listen and improve where possible, sorry it didn't live up to your expectations.
The environments do all have different models, not entirely sure why they looked the same to you. The audio has been mixed and positioned with great care, its unfortunate you feel so critical about that aspect. 
There are allot of animals within the environments and much of the content reacts dynamically, so a users experience with the animals is never the same twice, its possible that you caught some of them on a bad day.
Hopefully you will give Nature Treks a few more tries and who knows, we might win you over."

(Suggestions) As beautiful as this game is, I wish it was more interactive, like maybe rocks you can pick and and throw, maybe you can pet certain animals, and maybe give an option to where you can choose the music, but overall these 4 stars really show that this game is beautiful, if you happen to add what I suggested I will easily give it 5 stars, keep up the good work!","Feb 7, 2019 at 7:24 AM",4, 13,

Some of the trees strangley ""shake "" more than blow in the wind, in some scenes the same daytime birds awkwardly sing at night, and the ocean water seems weird and unatural.  I really support this kind of idea and hope that they will continue to improve the graphics and overall experience. I'm not sure we need so many nature scenes to choose from. Maybe fewer scenes with improved graphics would be better?","Dec 1, 2018 at 8:54 AM",3, 11,

But you know what? I dont care, cause it is all so serene and it is all so beautiful. I just find my favorite spot and then just sit there taking it all in. Sometimes I might throw an orb which may yield both snow flakes as flowers and sometimes I just wait for flowers to spring into beauty before they dissipate again...

2022-05-28 14:39:17.154290,Mach13-13,Great Design- Stacks Of Potential,"I'm gonna say worth  the discounted offer price for sure...

It's a great quality VR experience but it has so much more potential.  

Works well on my i7 7490 & 1070Ti.   Purchased at discounted price of 4.99 GBP I'm pleased with my purchase providing future updates deal with a few qualms

The GUI is slickly designed and works very well as an introduction to the whole experience.  Looks like a massive amount of work has gone into the GUI and environments (currently 15) They are pleasing and offer a great VR demo.  And that's the nag... at its current state... demo is what I 'm thinking I would use it for. But I do see how people could loose themselves in the therapeutic peace and tranquility. 

Would have got 5 Stars if it actually saved the changes you make to the landscape and other environs.  When you exit the scene and go back later the whole environment is set back to default.  I'm not sure how invested I'm gonna be transforming the environments, then returning if it doesn't get saved.

Would be even better if the experience offered more interaction (and better creature animation in some areas).  Wandering around (for me) feels a bit aimless.  That said it's pretty and an interesting, innovative approach to VR

I'm banking on the dev continuing to work on it tho.  I really do like this. It has stacks of potential to offer so much more.

The graphics are good but they're better by using Super Sampling x1.30 (Via Oculus Tray Tool) An experience that relies upon the scenery needs great graphics.  It would also be good to have a settings option.

DEV: features I'd like to see...

* Environment changes made saveable
* More purpose to the Trek
* Better quality creature animation (in some areas)
* Ability to use own music (or other audio) files from local disk
* Ability to invite friends around your saved environments

Will be very happy to change my score to 5 as and when appropriate updates occur.  I feel sure they will","Oct 14, 2018 at 3:40 AM",4, 22,

It doesn't have any objectives in it, there's really no begininng or end and that's what makes this so unique and wonderful.  For people who would spend countless hours wandering around hyrule just to see the scenery, this is exactly what you need.

I promise I won't get sick and leave you a bad rating. The snap teleportation is very annoying. Also, variable speed movement would be good, with maybe a logarithmic range -- squeeze lightly to drift forwards; squeeze fully to ""run.""

Four stars because the movement is still not wonderful (though that's an easy fix), but I love the worlds. Definitely recommended.","Jul 2, 2018 at 10:55 AM",4, 6,"Hello, thanks for leaving a nice review. Variable speed movement is possible with the hand motion, tilt your hand up and your movement will be reduced.
Seems like you guessed the reason we use snap (instant) rotation of 45 degrees :) Smooth rotation can often give people nausea.
For cases like this perhaps it would be ideal to allow everyone to set their own speed for rotation. I've made a note of this for the future."

You can now walk move, there's lots more environments (the quality of some of them feels better) and there are animals that create a more interesting experience. It's clear the developer(s) has spent a lot of time improving this experience, since I initially bought it. Well worth the money in my opinion. The sounds are fantastic. I remember buying an environment sound CD for more than the price of this visually impressive VR experience. The one thing I'd value in this would be to control the music volume and nature sounds separately so I would have the music very quiet and the nature loud.","Jul 26, 2018 at 1:05 AM",4, 3,"Thanks for taking the time to revisit the experience and amend the review, we really do appreciate that, its rare.

2022-05-28 14:39:23.454587,JamesTT,Potential to be a  VR masterpiece,"Nature Treks VR really deserves more credit and fame. Its a brilliant concept, expertly crafted with obvious care and attention to detail. Its been out for a while now and I feel could do with a graphical upgrade for some environments. I'd also find the UI a bit clunky and would prefer to navigate a menu with a pointer. 
 There is also room for a little more polish. This is essentially a one person project as far as I am aware and with that in mind its an incredible achievment. There are not many apps that do realistic natural worlds in VR and out of all I have played (which is most) this comes second graphically only to the blu. Whilst the blu is largely a scripted and static experience, nature treks vr is anything but, you can explore large environments freely using your choice of movement, animals wander about and its generally a serene and magical experience . Nature Treks VR is much less trite than guided meditation and in my book easily the best relaxation app available. Love to see a graphical upgrade, will look forward to the sequel.

2022-05-28 14:39:23.500465,David_Highlander,Nature Treks review,"Wow, now this was a surprise, a gentle way to relax in serene environments all in stunning 3D VR.  I had been looking at this game for a while as I like to chill and looked at the reviews so decided to buy and I don't have a single regret.
           There is a good choice of locations with each one offering something slightly different from walking through meadows, to sun drenched beaches  to ambient nights in the forrest complete with ambient sounds.  The controls are intuitive and am relieved to find I can actualy walk around rather than teleport which is a major must in this kind of environment.   there is some interactivity with the ability to generate foilage in the forrests etc, to stelar objects in space and fish in the ocean. There are also lots of things to discover like one scene has dinosaurs in a Jurrassic setting while another has wild animals roaming that you stumble upon. I also found a wrecked aircraft in the ocean that I could explore. Another scene has a camp fire and windmill with authentic sounds that add to the already lush atmosphere which is comprised background sounds to suit each environment complete with relaxing music which can also be turned off in an instant with the excellent control inputs using the touch controllers.  You can even add thunder and rain in some scenes and change day/eve times which alter not just the lighting but the atmosphere and backround sounds. Absolutely brilliant and it is obvious a lot of thought has gone into this and hope the developers keep updating and adding to what is for me the best purchase on the Oculus Rift as it is just so useful to me with endless replay value.
        I am now looking forward to any future expansions and will happily pay more for those as this is indeed a highly recommended purchase at a great price.
       If you like strolling and want to chill then this is the definite software for the Oculus Rift that really immerses you in each location with total freedom to roam.  5 STARS!!!","Jun 9, 2018 at 6:19 PM",5, 3,

The choices of environments are nicely diverse and the ability to modify them is a unique touch.  The graphics and color palettes are also very nice.  What ruins the experience for me is that the sound mix is, to put it kindly, terrible! The music is way too loud and your only options is to either have it on or off. You can't turn it down to a more suitable level (at least I haven't found a way). Turning the volume down on the Rift turns everything down.  Considering how complex the rest of Nature Treks is, adding a separate volume control seems like an easy no brainer that would earn it an enthusiatic five stars.

There’s nothing more refreshing than to be able to free roam all over a map smoothly. I’ve tried other nature based games, and found out right away I can’t sit in one place longer than several seconds. But ten or so minutes of virtual walks is all I need to relax and center.

The animals are the best part. They’ve come a long way since the first ones I saw, not only in graphics, but some will now come up and demand attention. How do you tell a tiger no when she plops down right in front of you?

The dinosaurs are one of the best new additions, but I love the game as a whole and having a developer who take our feedback graciously and tries to make everyone happy is amazing.

Don't let its' very reasonable price put you off, it is a well crafted, fully featured VR expereience which allows you to wander, create and control various aspects of every scene.

The scenery is amongst the best I've seen in VR, especailly the hillsides, rivers, trees, rocks etc.  You have blink teleport or free roam (joystick), You grab onto icons to turn on and off items in the scenes, some you can throw to add into the scene, making you a creator.  You can create, trees, rocks, creatures, bushes, flowers, butterflies, fish, so much to play with in each scene.

There are loads of different, stunning scenes to roam around in.  I some scenes you can control the weather and time of day. 

Not everything is perfect, the animations aren't the best (please keep working on the experience to make it better), ocassionally the music loop stops... I guess it depends how long you are in a scene.  These are not things which spoil the experience, but simply improvements which will just mak e it better.

It has become my go to when I want to experience VR for just getting away from it all. After just a few minutes of this immersive experience I feel happy and refreshed. The graphics are top notch. The developer clearly cares about the quality of the experience and people in general (you can tell by the frequent updates and improvements that have been made to it over time, and it was great from the start). That sentiment is really important because it comes through in the game. Not only with the increasing beauty and diversity of the environments (new ones and animals were added since I first bought it over a year ago), but also the layout, colors, sounds, options for locomotions and more. I makes a great demo to show anyone. In this day and age of so much violence in video games, it's nice to have a place to get away from it all. Not only the stresses of life but also to hop into VR and not get shot at or attacked by wolves. I know I was looking for something exactly like this for years and now I have found it in Nature Treks VR.

There is allot of content that will appeal to all types, ages and genders, making it a superb app to introduce anyone to VR. I've seen my nephew and grandma both gasp when playing it and they are 80 years apart in age.

Pros: The locomotion is very polished, there are a variety of ways you can move around the world making it a pleasure to explore. The creator orbs work brilliantly and add a whole new dimension to the experience, I encourage you to experience with them all, there are some memorable surprises. It looks great and there is a huge variety of large, quality environments to experience and discover. There are loads of animals to find. The variety of experiences available is perhaps its biggest strength. Want meditation app, you have it. Want an underwater experience, yes you can have that. Want a pure nature simulator, you guessed it. Since the update you can even create your own solar system. All these elements blend together and it works beautifully.

The Average: Some of the animal animations are amazingly life like but some could do with some more attention to reach that standard consistently. Some of the grass seems a bit flat when I get close.

The Bad: I didn't to write anything bad about Nature Treks VR because its given myself, friends and family such a lot, but for an app this polished, I think the UI (or lack of it) expects to much of the user. You might initially find yourself spending a few minutes working out if you can throw or grab something.

What I'd like to see: Some more work on some of the animal animations. I'd love to see even more details in the environments and some smaller creature on the trees and leafs.

To conclude, I found this to be a very touching and encouraging experience. A wonderful app that just keeps improving and evolving. I've played every relaxing VR experience and I can say with some confidence this is the best, by a considerable margin.","Oct 1, 2017 at 9:46 PM",5, 8,

A couple of points though : 

-I float above the ground and it's a noticeable when I sit to enjoy the place ; I don't think it's my sensors but you never know.

-The trees in the forest have sharp, cubic trunks, is that normal ? I didn't have that impression with trees in the other sims, is that because there are so many ?

The player position is about a 40 cm off the ground, allot of people prefer the sense of floating. So if your about 40cm off the ground its intentional, if its higher then it could be your sensor setup.  If I do change it to match the floor then I will need to lower the height of the foliage.

          RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER: Great. The developer responded so I decided to update my review. Their response disappeared and it reset the ""Helpful"" number to 0. It was 18. Anyways, maybe it's because I'm using an Xbox 360 controller but I can't move around. Why this isn't/wasn't possible from the beginning is silly. Ocean Rift allows me to move around in the environment with what I have. Why can't I with this program?","Jul 18, 2017 at 8:21 AM",2, 8,"EDIT: Free movement has now been added for non touch users. Use the bottom left trigger to move and the left thumbstick to rotate. Hope this makes the experience better for you.
Hello, The description does say that the duel layered locomotion system is for touch users. Nature Treks VR still supports the Xbox One controller through static teleport points, this still gives you more freedom than other relaxation experiences. Nature Treks VR reviews at 91% on steam so its unfortunate that you don't seem to like the experience due to the limited locomotion support for Xbox controllers , if locomotion is an important criteria for you in VR experiences I would highly recommend investing in some touch controllers. A new underwater environment will be added in the next couple of weeks, hopefully you will enjoy that experience and overlook the limit locomotion when using the controller."

2022-05-28 14:39:52.052703,Bru.Warden,Small room access to a big world.,"If you have a small space and want to escape to a large world, this is it. While the graphics are not top end (would tax the video card too much if it did), they are still good.
Two cons I have is: 1) The envirorments has a fog like appearance, obsures vision in the distance. This works well in the distance, but within ~200ft it takes away from the details. 2) In some envirorments, looking up to the sky causes a yellow pallor over everything.
Pros: 1) Good controls, with 2 ways to move. 2) Some envirorments let you control time of day, weather, etc (These are nice). 3) There is a lot of variety of plants and animals if you look for it.

Recommendations: I do like this, and I think it is fair for the price. Not a game but more of an experience if you want to get away.

Wish List: I would love a coral reef with tons of sea life; even if only 30ft circle (To sit and look around). Would want deep vibrant colours to go with this.

EDIT: I clarified some of my comments, added a 3rd Pro and increased the rating by 1 - This is due to more time spent in the envirorments and noticing the details that went into the program.","Aug 3, 2017 at 4:47 AM",4, 1,"Thanks for the review. Nature Treks VR is open world, this means the detail in the environments needs to be consistent throughout, I cant use 'tricks' that other games use for objects that the player never gets close too.

2022-05-28 14:39:55.202911,AshWhole87,"Very relaxing, excellent graphics!","I wrote to the developers about some suggestions and they were able to update the game with some changes. I would like to see more updates! So far, I really like it! It helps me wind down after a hectic day, I can be transported to a very relaxing and scenic place. I love the creators update, I like to play around with the tools available. Music choice is perfect! Would be better if there was an easier method for day/night and weather toggle. Also would be great to have more toys to play with such as glowsticks and fireworks! And also the ability to play your own music from your music library! Last update with the teleporting feature caused some issues, but hope they fix it!","May 14, 2017 at 12:35 PM",5, 7,"Day/Night and weather toggles will be changing so you do not need to continually hold the orb. Its the most requested change at the moment and will be sorted soon. There are about 30 music tracks in Nature Treks, I am going to try and make it so you can cycle through them. Seeing as elements within Nature Treks VR change dynamically to the audio frequencies I think it will be a good addition. I will look into the possibility of users selecting from their own audio collection but it will depend on the complexity of work and how this will get integrated into the UI. Not aware of any issues with the teleportation currently, if you are still experiencing these can you please contact me with details and I will get on it right away. Thanks very much for the positive review."

Thanks very much for the positive review by the way. Its been a bumpy road on the Oculus store at times so its really appreciated and makes all the hard work worth it."
2022-05-28 14:39:58.317221,SadGamerDad,Better than others in same genre,"Pretty environments. The creative content controls are cool. Would like for the weather and lighting effects to be persistent. Would like to see objects in the game like binoculars, in game camera and photos, Local music files access and any way to interact with the animals. And last but not least, I'm still looking for a nature VR game that will let me skip a stone across water! Is this impossible to implement?","Jun 14, 2017 at 3:09 PM",3, 0,"Hello, the toggle for the weather, time of day changes will be changing to be persistent so you will not need to hold the creator orbs at all times. Animal behaviour has been improved already and is one thing which will be updated as an important part of the Nature Treks experience. It is possible to skip a stone across the water by the way, its an interesting problem and will need to be done with physics, will have a think about that. Thanks for the review."
2022-05-28 14:39:58.335173,WKGB_Prewitt,Would be better without all the crap.,"I bought this thinking: ""Nature Trek, a trek through nature.""  Then I played it, and it was more of a stand in some places in nature, while listening to music instead of ambient nature sounds, while someone tries to guide you through ""meditation.""  You can't trek at all, you can only jump from point to point.  This should be renamed 'Meditation in Nature,' so that people will know if this game is for them or not.","May 8, 2017 at 7:58 AM",2, 2,"Hi Prewitt, Nature Treks does allow for that 'pure' nature experience. You can turn the music off leaving a full chorus of nature sounds in the environments. You have complete freedom to explore the locations if your using Oculus touch. The meditation element is the lotus enclosure accessible with the creator orbs, its an option and can be toggled on/off. Nature Treks VR has had several big updates recently, perhaps you have not tried it recently? If not please give it another go and I hope you have a better experience."
2022-05-28 14:39:58.352128,ManMythLegend,Conflicted,"A few really pretty levels mashed against one of the most abstract control schemes I've seen. It takes 10 frustrating minutes to understand and another 10 minutes to go through all of the content. Hoping for a Touch update to make this one actually usable, as at the moment it is fully lost in this mess of frustration. update Dev response says locomotion is coming so will rereview after this.","May 8, 2017 at 2:30 AM",2, 0,"Locomotion is available now by the way. Sorry you felt the UI to be frustrating, if you contact me with some specific feedback I can look into it. Shame your experience wasn't wholly positive but thanks for the review all the same."
2022-05-28 14:39:58.369084,shufflemoomin,,Cliched yoga music and bland environments. Low quality graphics and terrible animation doesn't add to any immersion. Certainly not worth $10.,"May 2, 2017 at 6:21 AM",2, 4,"Hi Shufflemoomin,
Nature Treks VR has had several big updates recently,I do urge you to revisit the experience now in the hope you get something more positive out of the experience.. In the new environment (Red Savanna) you will find elephants, lions, rhinos, hippos and more. Also the bird behaviour has been completely changed and they now form flocks and swoop down to the ground or to branches/rocks etc."

2022-05-28 14:40:01.509303,that_lightworker,Simply Amazing!,"This is perfect for meditation.  For a good experience grab a stop-watch, set for 5 minutes, open app, go to location, turn off in game music, stream your favorite music, and breath deeply the whole time while taking in the awesome view.  Switch to another spot in the same location 3 more times for a total of 20 minutes a day.  At some point you WILL experience a sense of presence.  Limit yourself to 2 locations a week and you will enjoy this for at least a month.  The environments are realistically wonderful and believable along with a convincing touch of wildlife.  Well worth the money.","Feb 21, 2017 at 11:32 AM",5, 2,Thanks Very much for the amazing review lightworker. I hope the updates are adding to the experience for you. All the best - John
2022-05-28 14:40:01.526258,richhard1,"Good, but has some bugs","Although the experience is ok, the set places to sit seem to always point in just the one direction, add manual movement would help. Also theres a huge reflection bug in the water, noticeably more in turquiose. I hope the Devs update this with the user in mind, rather than set views, Oh and those water ripples are way too fast, its meant to be a relaxing experience isnt it?","Feb 3, 2017 at 3:13 AM",3, 3,"Hi Richhard,
Those issues with the water are now fixed. You can now freely explore the environments. Nature Treks VR has come ALONG way since you left this review so if you uninstalled it I would recommend giving it another try. - John"
