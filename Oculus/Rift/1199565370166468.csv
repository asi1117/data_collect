2022-05-28 19:46:41.039516,Snouckeur,No update to support Oculus Touch !!!!!!,"I am very surprised that this game does not support oculus touch to aim.

2022-05-28 19:46:41.069436,Siegfriedshead,Gaze based shooting instead of touch?,"No.
Just no.
This game should have never been ported from gearvr to the CV1 without touch support.
It's pointless.","Aug 27, 2017 at 9:29 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:46:41.085393,Dan-Cainenstien-1,What! no trigger finger.,"Just push butten. It would be a good game if you can line sights up of the gun with head set. But it the other way around. Hay, it's part of hand and eye devolpment to play trick shoots.","Jul 26, 2017 at 5:10 AM",1, 0,"Dear FrankenstienOcain,

Your feedback is very important for us. Gun is associated with Remote/Game Pad controller to enjoy real feeling of Gun. We had ran user experience with many people and they enjoyed gun with remote rather than head set. So we decided to go with remote/controller style. We are assuring you that you will also enjoy the same once you play more and more levels.

Regards,
