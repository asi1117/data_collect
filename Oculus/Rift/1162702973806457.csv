2022-05-28 14:17:48.692602,Schindelar,Bugs Bugs Bugs,"- Bad or even NO physics
- Bad leveldesign, made with complete ignorance regarding holes in the world
- very bad movement behavior: you can ONLY walk in slow-motion
- no description for tasks you need to do to proceed in the story
- after climbing you have a 50% chance to fall down again because the final move to reach the top is not working correctly
SUMMARY:
This is by far the worst VR-experience I ever had !!!
It seems the developers did not have the mood to creat a good game. Nothing here is finished, nothing is sufficiently working. Even the simpliest things are bad like grabbing something is not working with the triggers like in 99.99 VR-games - nope - it's the button (A) that you need to press - I mean WTF????
On top of it you have a multitool to let items hover, to scan and to I don't know what the third mode is - it does nothing. Well this multitool is changing it's settings randomly - I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEVS WHERE THINKING when they made this....
I'm not a beginner. I'm CG-artist and developer. It's a shame to charge someone 29€ for such a miserable game - sorry","May 16, 2021 at 3:49 AM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 14:17:51.841861,Zoobley,Not worth your time,"Just got around to playing this game. Yes, the environments look good, but the game is flawed. I couldn't get past a puzzle due to glitches with the dumb dinosaur who is supposed to be your pet. Very frustrating. The game is slow paced, which was nice for just chilling but ultimately got too frustrated trying to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing and then why it's not working. Gave up on it after about 3-4 hours so tried to enjoy it best I could. Do not recommend at all unless free.","Sep 28, 2020 at 8:57 PM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 14:17:51.872779,Bangieboy,Flawed but beautiful,"I bought this in 2017 when I first bought my Rift but never got around to playing it as I prefer action games. Due to lockdown I've been dusting off my unplayed games and decided to give this a try. It really does look beautiful and graphically it trounces most more recent VR titles hands down. As you would expect it is very cool to wander around dinosaur land in VR. The game falls down badly though in controls and gameplay. Walking around like someone has tied your shoelaces together is not immersive. Neither is wandering around like a spare tool trying to figure out what you are supposed to do. Your 'helper' robot is so useless, if you really were stranded on an alien planet you would be dead in a day. Overall, it's fun to explore, but the fun is cancelled out by the frustrating gameplay. The graphics team deserve a massive pat on the back, the game design team deserve a massive, steaming, T-Rex pat on the head.","Apr 29, 2020 at 7:22 PM",3, 33,
2022-05-28 14:17:51.888736,cereal_keller,Boring and Frustrating,"I never thought I'd see the day when a game from Crytek was so bad I was unable to play it.  The biggest problem right off the bat, no way to run or speed up walking, which is painfully slow.  The graphics have potential to be amazing, as it's on the CryEngine.  But super sampling outside the game doesn't work and the in game setting maxes out at 2x.  My GPU is only operating at 55% usage, I could bump up the resolution significantly, but for some reason it doesn't work.  I'm an adult, playing a game where the main character is a child does not appeal to me.  It's too wholesome to be enjoyable and I don't have enough free time to dump into a game that's not fun.
The world in the game also has a ton of potential. You're lost on a Jurasic planet with gigantic dinosaurs all around you and environments that are extremely intriguing.  The climbing mechanics are fun, just like that game The Climb, also made by Crytek.  But that game was actually a lot of fun, challenging in a way that wasn't irritating.  This game, you'll get to a point where you have no idea what you're supposed to do, the robot assistant isn't saying anything, there's nowhere to go and the controls are so poor you can't do anything with them.  Sadly, I knew immediately, within the first 5 mintues I wasn't going to like this game. But I gave it a chance to pull me in, and it failed miserably.  The fact this is from Crytek, the makers of Crysis, really disappoints me. 
One thing that should be made known right away is that this game is from when VR had just come out.  Games have come a long way and I guess they were experimenting with what would work early on.  I never had any issues with motion sickness, I never have on any game.  I typically hate teleportation, but in this game that would actually be a blessing.  I bought this game months ago when it was on sale and just got to it today.  Wish I had tried it when I bought it so I could get a refund, now I'm stuck with this steaming pile of wasted money.","Apr 10, 2020 at 4:47 AM",2, 5,

2022-05-28 14:17:55.074296,tommosaur,One of the best and worst,"Extreme highs and lows.
First highs:
-One is stranded on a Jurassic planet, dinos everywhere. One has a baby TRex as pet, a hovering drone assistant bot and a gravity beam tool.
-The graphics can be set to look AMAZING. Easily among the best 5 visuals in VR available, still, today.
The game by default sets itself to no good settings where all is blurry and anything further than 3 meters extra blurry and way worse detail. But one can go into the settings and disable TSAA and instead increase the render scale and enable high quality distant objects. 
With those settings the game is stunning looking. 
When one walks around and has the gorgeous scenery and huge dinos walking and flying around, it is a sight to behold and something extremely worth experiencing. I regularly paused to just take in all the visual amazement.

The gameplay is a nice change of pace, it is about exploring, doing slight physics puzzles and walking and climbing around or giving the pet dino instructions and scanning and looking for items.

So far, i would give this an A for very well done and exceptional VR classic material.

Sadly, there are some quite low lows, too:
-The controls: bad: unintuitive mapping, things which should be done with touch hand usage needing multiple button mappings, pulling oneself up while climbing not working half the time, no run speed, in between i even regularly got stuck where i could only move a mm until i got out of the collision area.
The onboarding first hour until one learns the controls not great.
Some tasks not intuitive, one can get lost and the robot assistant not giving good help.
The story is middling, one looks for why the ship crashed, ends right when it would get about present instead of past.

Why i still played through the thing and give it 4 stars? Because the highs are so high and all lows could be adressed with two weeks on controls and help system. It has 95% awesome and 5% which messes it up. I want a second part with those fixed so much.","Jul 7, 2019 at 7:22 AM",4, 71,

I can spend hours in VR moving with teleport but walking around with the environment going up and down around me is just messing with me too much.  Is there an option to switch to teleport and not have to have blurred environment move by?,"Aug 21, 2019 at 7:12 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 14:17:58.194616,Archer1191,"Beautiful, but horrible controls","The game is beautiful, but I was unableto appreciate it since I kept getting sick and having to stop after 15 minutes. I do not for the life of me understand why they have not included blink/teleport movement like every other sensible VR game out there. If the game had this one detail I imagine I would have an entirely different impression, but with the awkward slow walking and the clunky unresponsive interaction with objects in the game I cannot stand to play it  without wanting to throw up and getting frustrated.","Sep 3, 2019 at 10:52 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 14:17:58.210574,Schrammo2019,Stunning!,"A stunning expirience and nicely made without the need for shooting and killing. Making Robin to survive his journey brings you along in a fantastic world of plants and animals, dinosaurs and stunning creatures. You may want to just stand at the edge of a canyon and watch the scenery. I loved this game. Not one single glitch or hang. Fluently done and nice story too!","Aug 6, 2019 at 9:39 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:17:58.225534,Elikal,A Control nightmare,"Ok, this game looks great, but it is a NIGHTMARE to control. First, the boy you play is unbelievable slow and cumbersome. Trying to grab something, pull something... it feels terrible. But the worst is the climbing.

Yes you have to manually climb, like pull yourself ledge to ledge, and with the unprecise touch control it's a bloody nightmare. I tried one of the climb puzzles, and the first hour I ended up falling to death all the time. It says ""pull yourself up"", but it doesn't work 90% of the time.

Then when I  FINALLY managed to get up to the nest, the character glides into some non-move zone and is STUCK. The developers have stopped working on the issue, as the years old scarecrow bug shows. The scarecrow itself is no big issue but it shows the developers dont give a crap after getting their money.

Adding climbing is quite a challange, but with such cumbersome controls it is NO FUN. I dont know how many times I tried, only to be stuck in the graphics. NO NO NO I WANT MY MONEY BACK! >:(

Btw, if I go to the website https://www.robinsonthegame.kayako.com/ which the developer recommends, the browser says ""unsafe"" and if I continue anyway there is no website at all. I mean... what the bloody heck.","May 25, 2019 at 10:36 AM",1, 24,

2022-05-28 14:18:07.717552,Flyingsailor,Gorgeous graphics,"(+) The graphics in Robinson are absolutely gorgeous and crisp! It feel like my rift just got a resolution update. 
Beside being a game it feels like a nature simulator: Not only dinosaurs, but even small bugs are depicted in great detail in their everyday life as well as stunning flora. Even the first flowering plants  are seen and early mammals are running around. In the skies different types of dino-birds and even the first known feathered bird Archeopterix! 
The only other VR game with the same attention to detail  I've seen so far was Lone Echo. This game is very much up there. It is also very atmospheric with the music and the sounds of the animals and it often adds suspense at the right moments.  
(-)
-The touch controls are implemented very basic. No pointing or other gestures.
-Tip: climbing up a cliff it took me forever to find out that I needed to outstretch my arms completely upwards; fists clenched and then lower them  to summit a ridge.
-In the farm I got stuck next to the pterodactylus nest on a cliff and had to restart the entire adventure; losing all my progress. Nowhere else did that happen and it only happened once.
-Some directions on how to use my touch controllers were wrong, but I quickly found the solution (the makers mixed up left and right touch).
-Game does seem to be abandoned by the developers ; last update 9 months ago despite some obvious bugs.

2022-05-28 14:18:10.837417,FrozenWave,Impressing,"Ok, it's not completely bug-free, and the touch controls could have been implemented in a better way (or at least have a better tutorial in the beginning). Initially, it's hard and a bit counter-intuitive to do things.

But it quickly gets better, the story is great, the graphics unbelievable, puzzles are quite complex yet not impossible to solve, and it's so immersive. So many different creatures, and both the tiny ones and the giant ones (oh, they can be SO big!) are extremely detailed and fluid in their motions.

Finally, the fact that you have to collaborate with cute Laika (the baby T-Rex) to proceed in the game is just a source of pure fun.

I dont know why this game isnt getting more stars. I think there are some VR gamers who prefer the physical action and shooting kinds of games.

This gameworld just looks absolutely stunning and due to its beautiful graphics, it is so immersive you feel like you're actually there. I played with touch and I've had absolutely no controller issues. Aircar and Alien Isolation without snap turning made me quesy when played almost a year ago. This game has not made me feel quesy at all. This is a great exploration/adventure type game and very immersive like you're actually there. This is what VR is about, and this game does this really well. The low ratings by others? Well this game has dinosaurs so probably attracts a lot of newbie VR players without VR legs. This game came out as a gamepad only game. Motion controls were implemented later. Maybe initial implementation wasn't good but got updated later with better controls. Even recent complaints of controller issues are probably those who are just repeating what they read. Controller issues are minor if anything. I certainly had no issues at all. Tip: when moving objects, you need to hold both controller triggers and use both thumbsticks. The game advises that. Using one contoller, manevouring becomes very difficult. Maybe that is the complaint. Not the games fault if you missed the advice. The jungle, the tar pit and planetarium areas of this game are bloody amazing to play. This is a must play game and one of my favourite vr titles.","Nov 8, 2018 at 10:56 AM",5, 20,

The graphics, polish and performance is on another level. I run mine maxed with x 1.7 supersampled and must say the prehistoric theme is incredibly well exectued with beatuful scenery and colorful views. I took one star away as the inplementation of Touch controllers is pretty basic with weird button layout. Forget Lone Echo type of controls. Here you use pointer and antigravity force to lift objects, hands are there only for immersion only (not even gestures).  I imagine this is due to porting from PSVR where the requirement is frontfacing 180 with move controllers. So at times you will struggle to get things done. This problem dissapear later as you get used to the controls but still I find this missed opportunity. Game itself is very slow paced which is cool for me as I like to explore and take it all in.

2022-05-28 14:18:20.363405,David_Highlander,Awesome Avatar/dinosaur settings!,"Seeing some of the previous reviews one would think this game is bad but that is not the case. Indeed, had they perservered  this game ups the stakes with increasingly clever levels from verticgo inducing climbs into ""avatar"" style trees to crossing bubbling mud swamps filled with huge dinosaurs, to meeting some raptors and a T-Rex.   With the help of your pet ""baby"" t-rex which you find is needed on later levels to complete and a floating droid giving you ""input"" along the way you set out hopefully to find other survivors when you find yourself marooned alone on a hostile planet.   The graphics are top notch with various graphic settings for weaker PC's  and resembles a cross between Avatar and the Jurassic period. The levels are designed with many puzzles which at first can confuse but I quickly figured out how to solve them gaining experience along the way that would prove invaluable in later levels. Some critisism has been aimed at controls but I had no problem with the Oculus touch; indeed climbing cliff faces etc was not a problem and was very intuitive despite some criticising difficulty in doing this.   Without spoiling later levels I found the pace steady with heart pumping adrenalin later levels especialy trying to avoid some raptors retreiving a battery only to find I needed to retread my steps with no save point hence lots of tension and sweating. 
      All this is augmented by the Oculus experience with the VR really putting you in the settings with graphics courtesy of the Crysis engine I believe.  Replay value is dependant on what you were hoping in the game in the first place but having completed the game I found some more things added which I look forward to checking out later.  For the price £10, this is outstanding value and recommended for dinosaur lovers as long as you don's suffer from vertigo because there's lots of hanging in mid space with shear drops made worse by the VR experience. lol","Jul 10, 2018 at 6:08 AM",4, 22,

I remember when I first heard about VR, this was the game I imagined with dinosaurs. The actual game play is pretty solid with elements of The Climb (I actually thought I was play that game at one point)and Portal but the sheer amount of creatures and dinosaurs is incredible. I would say Robinson is an essential for the Oculus Rift and not sure why its getting so much flack, I heard it didnt used to support touch and no you cant interact with everything like pick up stuff but those things are mainly static but you can climb and hold onto ziplines but most of what you do is scan things kinda like portal but yes it now has touch support and you can move your hands about. The graphics are hands down the best on the Rift so far and I love the scifi elements in the game, I havent got to the end yet but if my theory is correct I will be so happy coz it would be a perfect twist.

Overall story was also pretty good and there were some genuine jawdropping moments. Negatives I'd say... many of the puzzles weren't necessarily difficult, just a matter of randomly trying different control methods rather than actaul brain power. Without Youtube I think I'd have just given up at the first hurdle as the really weren't intuitive or rewarding... so gameplay was poor IMO. Critical items were easy to miss. Really think they could have done away with the annoying pet t-rex to simplify the controls a bit. Also the kids voice is really irritating. It's shame there weren't more dinosaurs also but my biggest complaint SPOILER ALERT HERE is at the very end when the t-rex appears.... that's the absolute climax of the game.. and the game forces me to look down and do that stupid scanning thing on the annoying cutesy t-rex instead of looking at the one thing I've been playing the whole game to see! Then, I have to turn around and run away from it, then play the daft energy link up mini game.... seriously i can't believe that that's the only time you actual get to see the adult t-rex in the whole game... very disappointing.

Touch controls are implemened and you can grab some objects and climb - well, mostly like in Crytek's other VR game The Climb ;-) But it is cumbersome to grab ledges and pull yourself up - I've died MANY times, but with a lot of practice you'll learn to manage. Adding pieces to fix a broken windmill using Touch got my blood pressure sky high. So Touch controls are often bad - and you'll sweat and swear a lot. And you'll need TONS of patience (like ""oh, well, I died again, oh my, but let's keep smiling and try for the 15th time""). Apart for some - occassionally - massive control frustration the game is a great expericence. Life is everywhere from the smallest insects in the air and on the ground to the largest dinos ever known; I've never seen a game world with such a massive amount of living organisms before. This is truly Jurassic World, and it really feels like being there - don't buy Ark Park or The Climb, you'll get it all in this game! ;-) You don't feel much alone thanks to the two AIs, your guide-bot and your pet baby t-rex. If I was a teenager again, to play this game I'd happily simulate a stomach pain to stay home from school - it's that good, but not right from the beginning. Don't give up on this game and get a refund before you've at least visited the Jungle and fixed the Farm. In many ways the graphics - although textures aren't always sharp - are just as impressive as Lone Echo. I'm running the game using highest settings for graphics including super sampling at 2.0 - ok, I did use normal antialiasing, temporal antialiasing looked too blurry. No matter the antialiasing I did not notice any frame dropping on an oc'ed GTX 1080 with i7 7700K and 16GB PC3200.

I find a few of the story elements to be a bit cheesy, and the controls to be unituitive, but I'm still loving the title.

My original review (below) was written in Sept of 2017.  While I stand by what I wrote at the time, I feel obliged to point out a few things: I am more tolerant of freeform motion than I thought I'd ever be, and Oculus now allows for refunds, so it isn't as applicable as it used to be.  Why do I still think little of this game?  Because it doesn't work.  There's a point where I'm instructed to point the laser sight at a place in the ground and tap the A button to make my pet dinosaur stand there.  I do this and nothing happens.  I instruct the dinosaur the exact way I'm instructed to in the game and the dinosaur doesn't move.  Am I doing something wrong or is it a glitch?  Either way my patience runs out and I give up playing the game.  I've started it from scratch probably five times and I keep running into this problem.  I imagine there would be more bad reviews if this was a common issue, so I'm inclined to think I'm doing something wrong or there is some glitch specific to my computer.  Either way, I don't get to play the game I'd very much like to finish.  Kinda hard to give a good review to that kind of experience.

Original Review:

Lacking a teleport option for movement, even two seconds of walking around with the joystick gives me motion sickness.  And apparently there isn't a refund option for North America.  This will be the last game I purchase from the Oculus Store.  I'll be using Steam exclusively going forward as they have a reliable refund option.","Apr 13, 2019 at 8:33 AM",1, 21,"Hello AaronSteinmetz, we are sorry to hear that you did not enjoy our game!

I hope the developers add more content and different ways to beat each part while updating it for touch controls because it's a big game world that a lot more hours of gameplay and replay value could be squeezed out of without making new scenes. I'd even pay for DLC for this with new chapters about hunting down other survivors or something. The game isn't too short though.

Once again Crytek have pushed the boundaries in game play and creativity. This game in VR is a joy to behold. If like me, you have a wonder for dinosaurs and a sense of adventure, this is one VR experience you do not want to miss!

Game Details:
Robinson: The Journey has arrived on Oculus Rift! Experience a mysterious and beautiful world as you navigate dangerous terrain and come face-to-face with dinosaurs in an intensely realistic virtual adventure.

When the Esmeralda crash-lands on Tyson III, a boy named Robin is left stranded. He must rely on his wits – and two unlikely companions – to survive. As he searches for the lost crew, Robin discovers that Tyson III is not the paradise once promised.
 
Immerse yourself in this stunning world and navigate dangerous and awe-inspiring territory on your quest to find what happened to the Esmeralda – and whether you really are the sole survivor.

Alongside AI unit HIGS and baby T-Rex Laika, you will become the first human to explore Tyson III, meet strange and extraordinary creatures and experience the intense realism of a virtual world powered by CRYENGINE.
 
Find the truth about the crash by searching for clues, and explore as the power of the Rift transports you to another planet.","Feb 11, 2017 at 7:41 PM",5, 11,

I guess they needed to keep the frame rates up! I found the sense of scale in the game is nothing short of incredible at times. 

I did struggle sometimes to know what I should be doing next but it didn't hold me back for long. A lot of the puzzles are pretty basic but the climbing game mechanic I really liked, gave a real sense of climbing and of height and being precariously balanced at times.

The menu and info system was nicely implemented and polished.

Apart from the graphics the game failed to grab me much to start with but you need to give it some time. By the time I got to the jungle I was hooked. It is a slow paced game though, so if your looking for an action packed game then this is probably not for you. It does have its dramatic moments though! 

The found the dialog a bit weak, but Robinson is supposed to be a child. I would have preferred a more adult oriented storyline and dialog but I guess they were catering for children too.

However the experience is soon over. I spent about 8 hours in the game all told including exploring, figuring out what I was supposed to be doing next and just generally looking around. You could play through it a lot faster if just racing to get to the end.

All in all, I have been impressed with the game which has some great moments and dramatic environments which really come across well in VR.","Feb 20, 2017 at 6:49 AM",4, 17,
