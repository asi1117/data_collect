2022-05-28 12:36:34.359070,Shooty_Megee,Join Bug,"Okay, so super short and brief, I love this game, 9/10 love it, but when I join any multiplayer game the game just crashes. The same for singleplayer, once I laod in, get killed, it crashes. I do play this on a RIFT S on PC. I hope this issue gets ressolved, and I'll be sure to give a fat 5 starts if It is, thanks!


New edit: April 25th,
Despite the recent update, my game still crashes. I've got a pretty good pc, but I'll run through what happens. So, for instance, I laod into Onward's menu, it's all fine. Nothing's wrong, and I'm free to select levels. In this case, I chose solo shooting range night. At times when I load in and see the tent, the game crashes. On a few lucky occasions when htis dosrn't happen however, I can spawn in with my loadout. Upon firing a few clips, or maybe it's a time thing, the game will freeze, and crash. In the menu, it says I'm all conected to everything. I can see the multiplayer search bar, and can see the player counts, yet when I try joining them,  my game instantly crashes. Maybe it's just an Oculus thing, but it gets really anoying. I hope I've brought this issue to light, and it may be resolved. If it appears normal from your side, I'd ask for a refund, so I may purchase the game on steam. Have a good one!",Apr 26 at 7:22 AM,4, 10,

2022-05-28 12:36:34.390985,nathanmnm,Great idea totally spoiled by muppets,"Just joined 10 co-op games, most were in progress so had to wait 5 to 20 mins to be able to play (seriously devs just put in an option to join a co-op loby BEFORE the freakin map starts) - then all of the games turned into idiot shows with 10 year olds drawing knobs on the board in the tent, shouting orders at everyone in high pitched voices (nobody cares if you want to hide in a freakin tunnel) and then the game starting and some muppet shooting team mates for no reason. Total waste of time.",Apr 22 at 1:54 AM,1, 11,
