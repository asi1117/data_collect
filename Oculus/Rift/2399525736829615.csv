I expect that he will take the feedback and expand on it, but I feel I must let others know that the current state of this game (5/21/20) is really disappointing. It does have the classic brick breaking like Breakout and Arkanoid with a little bit of 3D depth, but that is it. There are only 5 levels, one generic song and you only attain 1 point per brick, so clearing the level is exactly how many points you will always get. So, there is no reason to play any of the levels again unless you just really enjoy watching a ball bounce off of bricks. If an update comes out, I’ll update accordingly, but for now, I can’t say it is even worth $0.50.","May 21, 2020 at 12:28 PM",1, 2,"Thank you for the feedback. The game is in beta, so that is the reason why there are only 5 levels and few features. The fact that it is in beta, is clearly stated in the description of the game. With that said, please reconsider your review."
