2022-05-28 20:05:58.266188,Mickpatry,Now working fine,"Having read the previous review I thought I'd have a look as the developers replied that it had been fixed, and it has. With all VR app downloads though, I always remind folks that if your AV software blocks the app download, it ain't gonna run until you tell the AV to Allow the app :-) 
Loading time is OK, menu navigation is good. I tried the first sim 'Butterfly Island,' but I don't know if it's my eyes, but it didn't seem as if there was any synchronism to my right eye, so the overall effect was that it was clear enough with my right eye shut, but blurry with both open. I should point out that I have pretty advanced glaucoma in my right eye, but apps like 'Aircar' and 'Fantasynth,' and in fact all VR apps are fine for me and sharp in detail, because the headset lenses are so close to my eyes. I then tried'Awake The Light' and that ran fine.
This is a meditation aid, and I don't personally buy into the CEO's claims for the brainwaves headband (!), but tthis app looks (and sounds) pleasant and will no doubt appeal to New Age dudes and minfulness devotees :-)",Nov 29 at 11:29 PM,4, 4,

The bug on the loading screen has been fixed. The first time the app loads, it will only take about 10 seconds to load as there are about 30 experiences. It loads faster the next time you come in.  We'd be happy to give you a free trial so you can access the pro version of Healium. Just email us at hello@tryhealium.com . Thanks for reaching out. Nice to meet you.

There are quite a few on Oculus as well as elsewhere, and I have tried a number of them. This one is unimpressive compared to most. It uses 360 video that is not stereoscopic; they throw in some particle effects to make it appear there is depth. At least in the demos there was breathing guidance but no more than that. You can get that and more for free on Oculus with the excellent Maloka app, no need to pay $29/month. The catalog of locations is pretty small too; Guided Meditation VR offers a lot more for a flat fee that is less than one month of Healium. Or try Supernatural and get meditation and workouts for a lower monthly cost. The devs will claim that this is special because it supports biofeedback devices  (which they'll sell you for $180); meh, that's a gimmick and not necessary. Do not recommend.",Jan 24 at 2:21 PM,1, 0,
