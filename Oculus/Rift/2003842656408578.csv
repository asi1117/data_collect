2022-05-28 12:39:52.220677,to_shio,a good shooter with some major issues,i have had this game for a little bit and loved it but i feel like only 3 gamemodes and not much customization with some pretty bad AI is a bit sad some glitches are not so bad the 2 major ones i have encountered are the gun bug (where you cant draw your guns) and the aim not really a bug but sometimes it feels like shots are directly lined up but go strait to the side of where it should hit other than that i think this game is good and if you have the money should buy it this is my opinion feel free to have your own,Apr 17 at 12:28 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 12:39:52.235637,Gungrave696,Do not waste your money.,This game is a waste of money. The aiming system is horrible.  It keeps glitching out and resizing me either very short or very tall to where I am floating in the air and cannot take cover. Not very happy with the purchase.,Sep 25 at 5:36 AM,1, 29,

Had cousins and family get for quest, thinking it was going to be fixed, new maps, team deathmatch, .. I don't know what else to say except its like totally abandoned and not fun at all. Must been totally rushed for quest launch or something and no trying to improve it by the company at all.

2022-05-28 12:39:55.403770,St3ve_QC,So mutch fun,"Even know this looks like cartoony game, this is what makes it fun, the mechanicals for movement and gun control are just perfect, easy to handle  fells like natural.
Interaction with others is very cool, all my VR freinds I have, I got them here in this game. But still I wish we could send a friend request from into the game instead of trying to remember names.. lol
Many other game maker should learn there controllers behavior and mechanicals from this games.
I play every days from either my Quest or Rift S
Buy it, you will enjoy.

Down side is the random invisible bots issue, it's been over a year this was reported and still no fix and got worst with the reloaded version, this is frustrating and might end up in loosing popularity.. Please programmers, get this fix asap.","May 16, 2020 at 1:46 AM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 12:39:55.449647,taquitobuddy,"What a shame, rushed/abandoned game","This game launched to pretty bad reviews back in March, so I held off on buying it until the December sale.  Basically gave it a year to fix the issues and add content (most of the initial bad reviews were for the rushed release/lack of content).  Well a year later, seems like nothing is changed.  This is about the most basic multiplayer VR shooter I can imagine.  Maybe OK for a $5 game made by an indie studio, but for an Oculus Studio funded title it is hugely dissapointing.  There's no PvE at all, only 2 PvP modes (one of which is a joke), no progression, no customization, super basic gameplay.  Apart from the quite nice graphics, this seems like a project 1-2 devs could have throw together in a month.  Not even worth the sale price.","Jan 7, 2020 at 6:39 AM",1, 40,Hi we recently released an update that adds new game modes and levels.  Hope you get a chance to check it out!

The DEVS need to be a bit more active in the discord.  There are a few things that could be done to make this game ethe next big VR sport...  This game needs a TEAM DEATHMATCH with larger maps!  Also need some help fixing  the spawn locations and how  the game deals with players as they spawn.  I hope they get involved in the new year and listen to the players..

Some bugs like i get kicked out of the game after 15 sec or everyone is supended in either or you fall through the ground or you hang there and nothing happens so u just have to exit.

2022-05-28 12:39:58.644262,sosets-Gruz,Feels very much like Quake,"Controls need a couple of more options, this game uses headset direction as the forward movement direction, while most other FPS games use controller direction for this.
This makes it impossible to walk and look around without changing direction. And it is generally confusing and disorienting when you switch between Dead and Buried 2 and other FPS games.

Please add an option to make movement work the same way as in other FPS games by using controller direction instead of headset","May 22, 2019 at 12:59 AM",4, 233,
2022-05-28 12:40:01.753095,northerner2,Better and Worse than D&B1,"D&B1 was my favorite game, I sinked sooo many hours into that game. It definitely had areas of improvement, but it was fun to play. 

After playing D&B2, I wish I could have D&B1 multiplayer back (too bad the servers are empty now). D&B2 has a lot of improvements, but man was this the glitchiest experience for me. As I was trying to figure out why I was floating up in the air and getting shot by every opponent on the map, my teammates explained that it happens allllllll the time for them. My experience playing this game is: 
- Floating away from my cover
- Not being able to shoot too close to cover (even if you have a direct line of sight to the opponent)
- Getting shot through floors/walls/boxes (some cover actually works, some bullets just pass through magically appearing without any effect)
- Reloading and having my hands/guns start floating above my head

Never had these issues with any other game before.","Aug 21, 2019 at 7:28 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 12:40:01.769053,T3XASOUTLAW,Not sure if it's worth it in this state.,"TL;DR No smooth turning, no coherent matchmaking, no way to party up. It could be so much better, and it's not. Save your 20 bucks get something else at this time. 

SMOOTH TURNING. VR has been around long enough, and everyone I personally know only plays with smooth turning. Why in 2019 it's not a default option is beyond me. Guys its a quick update, just put it in there.

The matches feel good, but there needs to be a match making system. Just going from one point to another is a poor design decision. Should have a few hubs, Deathmatch, Team Death match, HORDE (WHERE IS HORDE MODE!!!???) 

In Many ways this game is a step backwards, and the fact it doesn't come free just puts the nail in the coffin I think. What will happen is the multiplayer will die before this game gets off the ground.","Jul 29, 2019 at 7:32 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 12:40:01.785010,Lirezh,Wrong focus and currently worse than DB1,"I got DB1 for free so I don't mind paying 19 Euro for this currently quite bad experience.  
DB2 tries to be a shooter while DB1 tried to be a fun experience optimized for VR.
This is a horrible design decision, now we have a really BAD shooter and the modes which are compared to DB1 are way worse than DB1 ..

Why not just make more maps, bigger maps, more guns and keep the principle of DB1 ?
Remove the FPS part, it's horrible .. Half the people can't play it due to movement sickness, the other half stumble around.

At this point I can not recommend DB2, I'll try if DB1 is still alive.","May 23, 2019 at 5:32 AM",2, 45,
2022-05-28 12:40:01.799970,PajaTEC,oculus chat problem,"Finally arrived the first update. :) I am so happy to join private match without bots. However I am so sad about the oculus chat. When i am playing with my friend we are always in oculus chat and we are talking about everything while we are playing. We were so happy not to disturb the other players because they didn't hear us. If one of us left the other at one of the map we could talk to each other and then we found each other. However now it is impossible :( If we are in oculus chat and log in the DAB2 there are no more people to play with. Why are we only two?
If we log in the game and then start the oculus party chat we can not hear each other in the oculus chat only in the game. It is so terrible. Please fix it if it is an error or please delete this function.

The only new thing new that has been added is the free roming deathmatch mode.

2022-05-28 12:40:04.916789,JoeMK,Not good enough,"I played the original and buried. I was very excited for this as being a Rift user with friends who own a Quest, I thought it would make for great online cross-play. There was clearly a lack of effort from Oculus' part on this one. It is clearly a downgrade from the original. It's hard to find your friends once you're on there. There is no way to invite friends into a game. Most of the games lack players online, and spend most of your time playing against bots. If there isn't many players online, they should limit the number of maps.","Jul 12, 2019 at 10:36 AM",3, 5,

And put a message for player’s saying they need to “explore” the lobby to find others maps and the other game mode in the Town, because others maps are almost only filled with bots.

AND ADD A FEATURE TO WARN PEOPLES THAT THEY CAN'T PLAY 50% OF THIS ""GAME"" IF THEY USE TELEPORT !!!!!

- Competitive Modes: Do you even know what a competitive mode is? And were can I choose the differents mode""s""?
- Portable: How is playing with the Quest a Quest game a ""feature""?
- Social: Make new friends ... I'm from France, I've heard a French speaking guy last night but I couldn't see who he was and you can't invite someone to you friend list in game... I really HOPE than if someone in your's friend list is in the game with you, he is in the SAME instance of the lobby. And HOW can I create a Game to play ONLY with friends?
- Weaponry: OK there is more than one weapon in the game but it's not a feature. (We're in 2019)
- Future Plans: Sorry I don't understand this ""feature"". You'll add events (like time limited?) to the Town and that's all.

Hope you’ll add the horde modes, some customization and a way to make private games soon. I still consider it’s overpriced for the actual contents.

Nothing changed in this BETA ""game"" after two weeks, and I can't get my money back... At least Gunfire Games was making good games and you destroyed this one.","Jun 5, 2019 at 9:15 PM",1, 19,

DB1 is superior in pretty much every category, besides the lack of players from not updating the game regularily.  I feel like the graphics on DB2 were not optimized for the new rift s and it definately shows.  Feels like an early access game.  Maybe i will come back to it if things improve, but as of now, not worth playing.  DB1 was in my top 3 fave VR games, so maybe my expectations were too high","May 25, 2019 at 6:19 PM",1, 11,

Even if it's focused on Multiplayer that's great, and fun! 

But effects, graphics of arms/hands and weapons don't look that great and it brings it down for me. Makes me look back on the Original version with great effects and graphics that make you feel beeing there with alot of details on hands/guns that are missing in this version.
  
If Oculus just make some tweeks and enhance the graphics for the RIFT's this could have been that number one game, now it feels like a port from the Quest to the Rift not making use of a PC's graphics and rendering capacity! 

Please, make a real rework that makes it shine on the Rift's","May 24, 2019 at 3:18 AM",3, 6,

Deathmatch sucks, no purpose.  Only ok mode is Shootout, but no robberies.  The lobby is ridiculous, users just saying the most messed up things and cussing, etc... out of control.  Not to mention if you continuously kill someone in shoot out, they might want to kill you in real life.  Come on Oculus, team this game is a joke and sucks.  However I have hope you will fix this mess up soon.  Like D&B 1 there are underage kids playing and have to listen to the perversions starting from the lobby and while playing at times.  Please make this game what it is supposed to be, as of now it is EARLY ACCESS, not worth 10 dollars.","Jul 10, 2019 at 5:43 AM",1, 4,

All this game has, is one massive loby... and 2 modes scattered around the loby; shootout and deathmatch. That's... it. The ""settings"" in the loby is a joke. This is one of the biggest rip-offs I have seen in a sequal of a game. The Deathmatch can be fun, but that's it. Even then with no options to change characters, unlock skins, different modes, &c. (basically everything needed in a decent game, or at least enough to make it NOT a downgrade than its predacessor), missing all of that makes it really limited and gets boring very fast. Just stick to Dead and Buried 1, way more fun. Man, what a rip off... oh, and it's just as expensive as the first one, $20. I recommend to not buy unless they update.

This one is fun but there is a lot less to do and some of hte design choices are weird, like having the facemask's direction determine which way you are moving when trying to steer with the thumbstick meaning you can't look behind you in deathmatch without moving the wrong way.

I don't get sick super easy in VR games but I did get sick after 30 minutes of this on an intense level.  I felt like my whole soul was nauseous.

4 stars is for how much fun I had in deathmatch, but I hope the devs are still working on it.  I can't REALLY recommend buying it in it's current state.","May 23, 2019 at 10:15 AM",4, 4,

Hopefully people will not be able to utilize exploits in this game as they were in the original so that people will continue to play it. Of the maps for Deathmatch: there are a few where you can implement tactics and have a good time then there are the others wheres it's ""DERRRRRRR I'M JUST RUNNING AND HOPING TO KILL SOME PEOPLE!!!"" and no tactics can be used. Winning a Deathmatch like that requires zero skill, zero tactics. I prefer the maps where a man can think.

The shootouts are so much better then the original DAB. The maps are larger and have more players. I have been playing this game since it was released and since being fully immersed in the game I can honestly say this gets 5 stars. Great job to the developers!!!","Jun 3, 2019 at 12:43 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:40:14.382889,sullyy2k1,Cracking Little Arena Shooter!,"Ok, so admittedly I'm only on day 2 of being a Rift S owner (coming over from psvr), so the novelty factor may sway this a little. 

This game is SO much fun. Within like 3 matches, I won. Which in turn means the game is incredibly easy to pick up. The lobbies are fully populated and the community as a whole on the rift has been great. 

Matches are just the right legnth. I think about 10-15 minutes? Also the maps are gorgrous and varied. They are also the perfect size for an arena shooter. It always feels like there is something happening around the corner without it being too crammed/vast. 

The game is great value if you are into multiplayer games. However, to the devs, I feel some sort of loot box (not paid!!) or battle pass system needs to be incorporated. This is a blast right now, but without reason to play, this could potentially get stale fast. 

All I can say is if you are even thinking about it, just do it. The price is great and the game will only improve with updates. Very pleased with this :)","May 23, 2019 at 5:10 PM",4, 1,

The forward direction as the head direction is not good and should be optional. Having the stick direction as foward would be better so you can look left or right and still run foward.
