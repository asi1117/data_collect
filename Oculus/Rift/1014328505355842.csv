2022-05-28 14:49:31.927614,Seltzersuds,need to come way down in asking price,can't hepl but feel I got ripped off. The few minutes I played completed a level to see that there is only the one. One level for $20!!! I read a review that there was only one but figured it was old the teaser made it look like there was plenty of different thigs to do. So I guess the develpoers are lazy people. Given the games content or lack there of.  Should be sold in the $1 to $3 range thats seems a bit more fair for what you get.,Apr 24 at 2:34 AM,1, 6,

The game will center you in your playspace, however the ""center"" of your room is NEVER the center, and often leaves you next to the ideal space.

I haven't run into the tracking issues as much as other people, though it's probably attributed to the game making you stand SO far away from sensors when using a 2 sensor setup. I'm running 4 sensors and I havent had any tracking issues, but buyer beware.

For me the cable on the headset ends up being super tight and actually almost pulling my head around which just isnt enjoyable in the slightest. If youre able to put your sensors far in the opposite direction of your headset from your PC this shouldnt be an issue but its so annoying. The space they make you leave never gets used and you cant reconfigure the view within the app either.

And it would be, if touch support were better. The game intenionally allows Nigel's hands and the touch hands to go out-of-sync- I think this is a huge miss and breaks immersion. It also requires far too much space forward- I had to go to the very back of my play area, and for no good reason- the game never makes use of that space in front of you.

I've also had issues with it tracking- it seems like it'd often lose sync with the Rift and recorrect far too aggresively- I only have 2 sensors but that was plenty for Robo Recall.","Aug 17, 2017 at 12:33 AM",3, 14,

Maybe they are talking about the difficulty involved with picking things up, which if you've played the regular surgeon simulator you'll realize is completely intentional. This is a game where you play an incompetent surgeon, not an actual surgeon. It's fun to clumsily slap your hands around and fumble trying to pick things up while accidentally killing your patient.

2022-05-28 14:50:06.825376,Ruined,"Fun, but needs work","I thought I'd give this a shot since it was on sale.  I don't think it is as bad as the initial reviews but it does need some work, and perhaps the briefest tutorial will work (besides what is on the monitor to the left).

First, to pick up something you need to hold X/A in addition to the triggers, and I believe that is unique to this game.  This first point may cause a lot of people frustration as every other touch game does not have this mechanic.  So perhaps a very brief text tutorial overlay on first play would help to let people know to hold X/A also when gripping.

Second, the tracking does seem quite finicky compared to other touch games.  When I say this, I mean times tracking is at times either completely lost or jumps around stuttering - does not appear intended by game.  Some work appears needed on robustness of tracking.

Third I experienced a glitch where my left hand completely disappeared when the game was unpaused, but when paused the hand was there fully tracked no problem.  Unpause again and it disappeared. Odd glitch.

Fourth might be better to make things easier to reach, some things approach boundaries even in their starting spaces in a 5x7 space, and when dropped can be unreachable.

Overall it is quite fun even with flaws and scores high in comedic value, but technically remains quite challenged. I hope the dev patches some of these issues.","Dec 29, 2016 at 4:22 AM",3, 17,
