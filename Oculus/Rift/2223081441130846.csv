This one does well in motion capture and creating the environment of a classic tale of the spirits of past/present/future. However, the speaking is just so slow and even with that slow pace it is only 20 minutes long. The beginning felt more detailed with story, then the other two parts were just like, here’s the ghost, one piece of story, done. There is only one interaction at the start and finish, but for a movie like experience that is expected. Most of the story is dark and and a little creepy, but the Rift S LCD screen ruins the dark rooms and washes out details (no fault of MWM Interactive). There is one part that might make people a little motion sick, even my stomach dropped because it was so sudden, but the rest is all seated. I can’t say this was a bad experience, but for $6 I would have hoped for a little more.","Jan 25, 2020 at 3:39 PM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 20:58:10.097447,XinvolkerX,,"It was a wonderful experience. Eerie, dark, and a constant feeling of spooky anticipation. I ran this experience through the ""Link"" to my Oculus Quest though my laptop that has more than enough VR ready specs and Chained: A Victorian Nightmare delivered what I will now consider a new annual Christmas tradition. I even sat though the ending credits till the very end because the developers deserved to have their named be read. Great job!","Dec 25, 2019 at 4:12 AM",5, 8,"Awesome news, thanks for the review!"
2022-05-28 20:58:10.112407,Balcombe,Doesn't work with Oculus quest via link,"Hangs when you try to start and then comes up with an unreal crash
..having updated graphics drivers, and opted in to Oculus beta, now working
Updating review from 1 to 4 stars as it really is a very good experience although it seems to start of well paced and then kind of accelerates through to the end a bit like a child had written it at school","Dec 30, 2019 at 1:12 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:58:10.126370,agrigori,,It works on my oculus quest link. I just couldnt get into it. I did the first one (ghost of past) and it was pretty boring. I was expecting a scare but it was just a ghost talking in a rhaspy voice.,"Dec 28, 2019 at 1:26 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 20:58:10.142327,DARKCHILD_UK,Nonsense.  Wont install,If you have virus protection on and the complete download is wiped away like a mystery set of files that did not exist!,"Dec 26, 2019 at 3:08 AM",1, 0,"We're sorry to hear this, have you contacted Oculus support?"
2022-05-28 20:58:13.251013,ParadiseDecay,This is more a visual experience!,"My Initial Thoughts:
Chained: A Victorian Nightmare is a non interactive creepy 20-30 mins experience. It has some great visuals and effects, some well detailed locations and I loved the graveyard scene.
I did notice some slight performance issues on my 1060 and this is probably an experience you will only likely to try once, so put that into consideration based on its price.
