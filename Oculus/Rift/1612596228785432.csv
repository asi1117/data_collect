2022-05-28 19:08:37.869811,Wunderbear,Settlers,"Update: I got to the stage where you need to build churches etc and to be honest. It has sucked all of the fun out of the game for me. There's just too much to do. Too many things to remember. I prefer a simpler game. If at any time the devs take all this extra faff out. I will return to the game. Everything I have said previously still stands. 
I used to play settlers on the Amiga and loved it. This is similar but better in most ways. I love the control system. Being able to zoom in and out, rotate etc is simple.  Being able to zoom right in on the action is excellent and the detail is exceptional. This has now developed into a full game (13 maps I believe).
I have now played a few levels and am addicted. The detail in the settlers, animals, birds, buildings everything is just what I wanted.",24 days ago,4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:08:37.884771,Brandon Kolvir,Warcraft naustalgia,"I play Townsmen on the Quest 2.  If you like Warcraft, Warcraft 2, Populus or Power Monger; this game will draw you in. It starts out pretty calm, mostly a story driven tutorial with Sir Clunksalot. Plenty of opportunity to just play about, no need to rush through.  You can pretty much pick up everything. You can even help your workers by moving their loads or picking them up and placing them at their destination. But yes, I have fond memories of the origional Warcraft II game, and this plays very similar, with less tedium.  For example, if you don't need a wood-cutter but do need a fisherman, you can take the forrester and put him in the fishing hut and voila! He's fishing.  Totally worth the money.  Well done, guys! :)",Apr 4 at 10:11 PM,5, 1,

This is really enjoying tutorial and preview how fun and natural RTS and town building game can be. In the end it is just a tutorial with nothing to do after.

2022-05-28 19:08:41.062273,Masamune5454,"ok its fantastic now, very deep.","update, the game has gotten much more complex and i love it. the game originally was like one little world. the devs did right by making the game in full and not by updates, but we didnt know that, so it looked like it was just ghosted. i guess we get lucky enough to not pay the full price, so thats a perk of supporting them lol. as far as the full game it is fantastic so far. i hope theres some reealy big levels coming up. (there are it seems) i would like to see more. reminds me of a deeper tethered with more interaction. i want to build a place and manage it as well. this game does need some more managing. main thing is dont stop, keep going on this. heck maybe even the other handyman game could be upgraded, i liked the dungeon one. good luck devs",Jan 24 at 3:03 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:08:41.077233,Enzo_Matrix,Almost Perfect,Great game If you love God games especially Black & White its pretty much the only option idk about the price if you can get it for around $10 do it but right now its basically a really long tutorial after the first 4 islands I started to get really frustrated that I was still stuck learning basic stuff and starting a new island over and over and over hopefully at launch there will be a sandbox mode where you pick an island type and just play till my eyes fall out that and the addition of seasons or more trading/Diplomacy is the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star 60 dollar game id even buy dlc :P,Nov 30 at 6:30 AM,4, 3,

A full story, multiple islands and more. This is the scale and god-like game that had me hooked on the demo, now with more to expand on.

*Original Review from 2020*It has the god-like view and control over the people, help them build, gather resources, build a military and defend themselves. Has a nice introduction tutorial to give you the mechanics and you get some time to help defend your island. That is it…. There is no more…

I just didn't realize that basically the entire game was just what was in the trailer, and the tutorial tells you how to do everything, and then that's it, you keep getting attacked, and you fend off the attacks, and.... that's the game. no upgrades, no additional buildings, no attacking other islands or expanding your own civilization.

2022-05-28 19:08:50.559871,IMN666,The good die young,"This game has excellent potential, yet has died off. I got it for free with store credit I received from an oculus app update that was messed up, so its not real loss. This should be a lesson to people to never buy early access, as the development can come to a screeching halt for any reason, and you're out X amount of dollars. I see responses from the developers saying its not dead, yet theres no news, or updates at all. I'd wait until it's officially released, IF it ever makes that far.

Developer response, lmao. Going on social media doesn't mean anything. Don't waste your money on this.

To be clear; I am not disagreeing. It is short and there havent been updates in a while, does that mean it deserves one/two star(s)?

Now thats out of the way: This game is fantastic. It is such a well thought out RTS experience in VR. In this game VR is not just a gimmick, its part of the game. Love what they did here!

They haven't updated it in almost a year not even one thing, no new building, no new combat system, not even a bug fix nothing. I bought this game hoping that it would be a good game that was updated at lest every 2 months but all i got was a small island with like 5 buildings on it and only 20 max people.

2022-05-28 19:08:53.714433,NBDE,,"I bought Townsmen VR because I have been playing Townsmen on my android tablet for over a year. In the Android version,  I love the time and resource management as well as the open ended play options.  The variety of potential landscapes, the different seasons and the angry villagers can give hours of game play.  The chance of fire, famine or attack bring danger and risk to the game.

In this new VR version, I love the ability to place the buildings by hand, and move about the village, as well as the ability to really get in close and look around.
The movement is a bit clunky right now, I would like to have a movement option that allows you to cover more distance.    The hands are also a bit large for reaching into such small spaces.  

Features I'm hoping for:  Different land mass options (especially one without a giant hill in the center).  Or the ability to grow your island?  Ability to plant trees where you want them instead of having the few trees regrow.  A happiness index to give us a target to aim for, as well as an economy.  A merchant ship instead of a merchant carriage? I especially would love to see the campaigns, and quests.

I'm only giving it 3 stars right now, because it is still in it's infancy.  I can not wait until it grows to exceed the android version.  I know there is so much more to look forward to.  I'll be back to change my rating as the game comes into it's own.  If the best features from the non-vr version are merged into this one, I'll be playing it constantly!

**It's been a year since my original review and there has been no update and very little communication.  I contacted the developer via email and they assure me they are working on it, but I'm disappointed that it's been 18 months since the game was last updated.","Jul 1, 2019 at 10:44 AM",3, 10,

Updated review 24 aug 2021
And 1 star now...year ago they promised a big update...but nothing. Such a shame cuz it had potential to be great. 
Keeping it on early acces and not do anything is just a way to scam people.

2022-05-28 19:08:56.859022,Wiz1974,Great Concept,"Great concept, but as another player said, at the moment it is really lacking in content.  Once the tutorial is over there isnt much to do.  The control system can get a little annoying at times too.","May 18, 2018 at 4:59 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:08:56.874980,Kessh1n,Limited,"While my wife and I enjoyed it, it's super short. Pretty much after the tutorial there's not much left to do. No battles happen, no missions, no anything. I know it's early access but with the limitation it should offer more for $10.  Once game gets better then I will change my rating. Things I would suggest to the developers:
- Expand island so you can actually build and place everything
- Have options to move around already built buildings
- I think a fun feature would be to allow the black cloud to rain so it can help farmers in some way?
- Include more missions or challenges
- Allow a military member to have their job changed

*Update*
I updated my rating from 2 to 3 stars. They added a lot of good features that should help the game evolve. 
*To developers*
I'll post this as a response since there's no reply option. I am patient, I just expected more than a tutorial for $10. Keep in mind I still praised the game, because it has a lot of potential and you guys have done a great job so far. Minus the content at time of play for price.","Mar 31, 2018 at 1:49 AM",3, 8,"feel free to contact us over Facebook or contact us. We will add new features regular. Grey clouds can rain, just squeeze them and you can do a lot with it. If you squeeze a black thunder cloud you can get lightnings which can assist you to defend your island.

2022-05-28 19:08:56.890937,CaimsPact,Wait I guess,"It just doesn't seem you get to do much as it is. I was left asking myself ""now what"" after the tutorial. Maybe its just that I could not find what would be worth while doing next. I kinda felt I had already experienced most of what the game would have to offer at least as it is now. So waiting for the game to be finished, or at least for more content would be my advice.  

 It did not look to bad what was there tho. I guess I should add that I did manage to drag it out to about 40~50 min of play. But that was with waiting a bit to see if ther would be another enemy attack. >.> Maybe I just did not wait long enough?","Feb 15, 2018 at 3:31 AM",2, 6,Thanks for your feedback! The game is in early access so more content is yet to come. You can trigger enemy attacks manually over the ingame menu though.
2022-05-28 19:08:56.907891,BrutalHulkSmash,,"If I play for more then 30 minutes it seems my people just run straight into buildings and keep walking into them so therefore I never get the resources I need to build/craft. Kinda crappy when I'm sitting there watching them walk straight into a building and there is no of fixing it unless i pick them up and move them out of the way, that is really annoying so I'm going to wait for future updates, game is garbage because of that.","Mar 22, 2018 at 12:11 PM",1, 0,"Hi, can you please contact our support?

Also pathfinding got improved by now so that probably might solve the issues you had."
2022-05-28 19:08:56.922852,gitzerai,Expect what it is - early access,"I'd like to support the developers at least this way to continue working on this because I can imagine the great potential of the game and the possibiities VR brings! Loved the fact that I could have townsmen do the work or I can just speed all up by doing stuff myself, firing catapult and its reloading was also really nice.

For buyers, note: its basically a tutorial ending up with sort of sandbox play but with no further content. While it might sound like not enough, I am hoping this game will turn out much better later so I am happy about my purchase.

I didnt experience any crashes or technical issues with the game. If there is anything Id suggest itd be:


- once you ""finish"" the tutorial, I'd say a little info about ""this is the end"" would be good. I wasnt sure if I should have been waiting for more attacks, having more quests coming later or if I missed something.


- one thing that was bothering me was my constant slapping of everything around as I moved through the map. Maybe it was because of my seated position and the angle, but lot of times I felt like I was slowing down my workers performance by constant (unintended) slapping :-) Not sure if theres something to be done about it, I love the interactivity otherwise, and could have been my seated position.","Mar 11, 2018 at 3:35 AM",5, 4,thanks for the huge feedback and yes your suggestion will be implemented soon. :)

2022-05-28 19:09:03.202057,ZzslappyzZ,,just bought the game and it wont start. says entitlement check failed,"Mar 11, 2018 at 2:38 AM",1, 1,That's very strange and shouldn't be an issue with the game but rather with the store. It checks if your purchase is valid. Do you perhaps use 2 different accounts? Did you just try to restart your PC and see if that helps somehow. I don't think we can fix that.
