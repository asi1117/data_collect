2022-05-28 19:30:50.010510,loebane,Shows promise,"I had no idea how to play this game - I just followed along holding trigger and steering (actually selecting from one of a few tracks) bumping an electric laser thing.
You have to go to the website to learn how to play. Hopefully a brief pop up in the menu or at the start of the race tells you that you fire by looking at things, red spheres increase your fuel, and blue spheres replenish spent ammo.","Oct 8, 2019 at 5:04 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 19:30:50.026467,myrrh404,Nice early-access demo level. Good job.,"I almost didn't download this, looking at the reviews. That would have been a mistake. Apparently, some people expect to get a full hours-long, ultra-fancy game for the price of free, on something marked ""early-access"" no less. I thought this was a nice demo level, with a great framerate and no bugs. Looks clean, plays well as a casual arcade-style game. Also, it somehow didn't give me the green-stomach, despite the amount of swooping around on the track. Decent job, Devs.
Edit 06/09/19 to add: I also appreciate the Dev(s) not using an obnoxious voiceover. I'm tired of otherwise decent games ruined by a cutesy voice continually yammering in your ear. The one you've got is business-like and doesn't grate. Kudos.","Jun 10, 2019 at 6:53 AM",5, 10,"Thx, the idea of how to play this game was indeed, that you get the full game experience instantly, complete one level in a few minutes and put it aside. On another day, you can continue playing with the next of overall 11 race tracks."
2022-05-28 19:30:50.041427,mindcola,"Cmon guys, it's free...",Crazy how volatile the reviews are in here.  This is a great proof-of-concept single-level experience that you can enjoy in VR - for free.  It runs fine and didn't have any observable bugs that I could see.  This is worth a shot if you have a few minutes to spare.  I'm sure the developer would appreciate some constructive feedback.,"Jun 8, 2019 at 10:51 AM",5, 4,"Yeah, you are right. Objective feedback would be very helpful and appreciated by the dev."

If you like experimental high speed racing games on rollercoster tracks, you should check it out. Otherwise, you are right, it wil be a waste of time to install it.

If this is your type of game, but you have some problemes playing it, please try the following:

Have a look at the video, it will give you an idea, how this game is meant to be played.
Visit http://www.orbtrain.com and have a look at the game rules under the HOWTO section.
Start the menu and change the DIFFICULTY paramter from standard to beginner. 
Try again, it takes some minutes before you get a feeling for it, how the game reacts to your inputs."
2022-05-28 19:30:53.308801,Luzifaro,Bad,"After reading the bad reviews and seeing that it is free to play I had to check it out myself, and I wanted to like it but I can confirm how awful it is. The track is somewhat fun to drive around in, but aiming and shooting with your vision is just super awful, especially with all the high speed turns and the opponent switching lanes, which makes it very sickening and unplayable. The other modes of shooting arent any better and in general this game doesnt feel like having a goal, or any objective in it that you can reach.","Jan 13, 2019 at 5:21 PM",1, 2,">After reading the bad reviews and seeing that it is free to play I had to check it out myself, and I wanted to like it but I can confirm how awful it is<
There are no bad reviews, Mr. nightcat.mau did not finish the tutorial and Mr. Zencala1 played it for 2 minutes. To review a game, you have to play it for many hours.  I really can't retrace the other 1 star ratings. Therefore thank you for your comment, that helps me to clarify some things.

>The track is somewhat fun to drive around in...<
I dont´t think there are many games out there with such amazing tracks.

>but aiming and shooting with your vision is just super awful,...<
You can´t hit the orbtrain, if you can just see it. You have to put your vehicle in a good shooting position, then you can take aim the target comfortably.
If you have to twist your neck to aim the target, your vehicle is not yet in the right position.

>especially with all the high speed turns...< 
It's a dexterity game. You have to make an effort to chase and hit the orbtrain. You can´t hit the orbtrain in a high speed turn. You have to drive through the turn and wait until the orbtrain is in a good line of fire.

<...and the opponent switching lanes>
Well, the orbtrain does not want to be hit, you have to chase it. The orbtrain pulls you through a rollercoaster track, that should provide you a nice virtual reality experience.

>and in general this game doesnt feel like having a goal, or any objective in it that you can reach<
You have to chase the orbtrain, separate it´s elements and collect them to gain points. If you have distached enough elements, you reach the next level.
You have to collect energy and ammunition at the right point of time and to destroy obstacles, which block your way. The gameplay is very well balanced to make the chase exciting.  

The overall concept of this game is, that you can get fun out of it, because you can handle it. It´s like flying a model airplane. You have to practise
before you can do it but after that that, you will like it.

Please watch the video to get an idea, how this game is meant to be played."

Steering is a crucial issue in this game. In the first version of this game, you had to drive through corners by yourself. No one of the testers could handle it.
Because of that, a automatic steering is now the default steering type. The car drives through corners automatically. You just have to change the lane.
You can change the steering type in the menu, there are the following options:
Beginner: The car drives automatically through corners. That is the default setting.
Standard: You have to steer through corners. A subtile semi automatic steering is supporting you.

>... the developer should add a warning cause sometimes...<
Good point, I will add this to my todo list.

Thank you!"

This game is free of charge, you have not paid money for this. What are you talking about?

>Only played for 2 minutes.<
After 2 minutes I too would not be able to play this game. You have to practice a little. Please read my Blog, there are hints how to play this game.

>Its very difficult to accelerate.<
It´s an uncommon way to accelerate. Imagine to accelerate a train. The idea behind the acceleration concept is, that you have not to press a button all the time, so you can concentrate better on the high speed gameplay.

>Change this game to something else like ""centipede"" the classic game or something.<
VR is a new medium. I think converting classic game concepts to VR is not a good idea. After that you almost have the same game. The only difference will be that you are playing it using a VR headset. VR offers many possibilities of new game concepts. This is one of them. 

>Believe the negative reviews. Believe me.<
Please do not believe this guy. He said he paid money for this, but it´s free. He writes this review after he played it for 2 minutes. No one can rate a game after 2 minutes of playtime. Please make your own opinion!

>Please, please, please dont buy unless its free and then its still not worth it.<
It is a free game and practicing how this game is played is well worth it. If you can handle it, you will get a stunning VR game experience."
