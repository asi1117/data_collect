2022-05-28 16:43:04.446536,N1ckyD,Absolutely amazing,"I really really love this game. Honestly the execution of it is amazing, the sense of scale and size, plus the detail of the aircraft. I would have paid £100 for this game for how much I've enjoyed it. I can only hope that there may be additional content or a second game in due course. Really, really excellent.","Aug 30, 2020 at 5:07 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:43:04.461495,OversizeWizard,Brilliant but gamepad only,"Bought both versions as I didn't know they were the same and this version is only gamepad.
For touch controllers, get the normal version.

Bit nice graphics, and fun gameplay.","Apr 1, 2020 at 4:10 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 16:43:04.490418,howardlivingston,Does not work on rifft S,"I did not read the reviews befor buying. It does not work on the S. They should say this in the discription,","Jul 8, 2019 at 11:23 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 16:43:04.504380,RageOP,"Good game, but buy right version!","I like this game really, but there are two versions from this game. I have buyed this version first and it was not working with Rift S, because room scaling is not supported. If you want to use room scaling, buy Final Approach (without pilot edition)","Jul 2, 2019 at 7:37 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:43:07.624037,reistlin,Gamepad required...,"The description does start with ""Grab your gamepad"", but I didn't think it was the ONLY contol mechanism! ""gamepad"" should have been in all caps and bolded out. To quit - or do anything else at all - you either have to hang the touch controllers on your wrists, or remove the Rift when you're done. So user-friendly...
All piloting is also done looking from a bit above and behind the planes you pick,
but the view doesn't stay there. You have to swing your head after the plane, and sometimes it's impossible to do that sitting. The whole head swinging had me feeling lightly sick really fast, about as fast as fluid movement options in other games do.
Also, compared to piloting games (or the touch-compatible version this comes with), this really wasn't all that fun.","Dec 14, 2017 at 1:49 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 16:43:07.638997,MarquisDeSang,Controls are stupid and clunky.,I fly all kinds of RC and do a lot of flight sims. This game has the most stupid controls ever for flying machines (you would expect that from a dev who have never even bothered to look at how airplanes and helicopters actually works). And the goal of the game is only puting stuff inside bounding box to trigger the next event. Very repetitive and there is no pleasure in controlling the airplanes and helicopters. And you have to control the camera manually because it never goes where it should. Worst VR game to this day.,"Dec 24, 2017 at 10:12 PM",1, 3,

2022-05-28 16:43:10.785581,PatsyCoconut,Fun and quirky.,I have finished the pilot edition and it has been enjoyable. The controls took some getting used to but once it clicked I had a blast. Added value considering you also get Final Approach with touch support. It is a whole different game with touch. I would recommend this game once you have exhausted some of the top titles. 7/10,"Dec 26, 2016 at 11:07 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 16:43:10.814504,Azazel08,looks great and fun for a little while.,"this game is good on a sale price, but i would not recommend it at the $25 price. i bought it for $18. this game alone would be worth $15, but the good news is that this purchase also will get you the Touch version of Final Approach. I definitely feel like I will get great value for my money. And Pilot Edition was really good for a few hours.","Nov 27, 2016 at 4:15 PM",4, 2,
