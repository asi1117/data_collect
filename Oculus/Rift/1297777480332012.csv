2022-05-28 16:42:01.930743,Angelina Starr,Not for me,"After reading the reviews, I really think I was expecting more.  Human scale would have been a nice touch, for starters.  What was here was all right but there wasn't much, unfortunately.","Oct 24, 2020 at 3:21 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:01.945703,TonyByte,This is what I signed up for.,"I want to see more of this is type of VR. Travel places and explore things like never before. Another reviewer said they could learn this on YouTube. Ridiculous comparison; no forward thinking IMO. You can just use Google Earth as well. I choose Google Earth VR! Imagine being able to visit landmarks like this in a click, all over Google Earth VR. That is where we are headed and I'm thankful to get a glimpse. Someone has to start the process. This is it. This is well executed, highly detailed, and has useful cut-away views to the inside of the structure. The developer takes advantage of VR and it's informative. However, I believe a life-size scaled view should be added to complete the experience of this massive man-made structure.","Oct 27, 2018 at 8:31 AM",5, 6,thank you :)
2022-05-28 16:42:01.961660,FastLawyer,Worse ways to spend $2,You get a nice little educational tour of the Hoover dam that's has a lot of detail in the scale model. You can even zoom into certain parts. I didn't see a way to get 1:1 scale which is what I was really wanting and part of the magic of VR. But it was only $2 and was amazed at the quality for the (sale?) price.,"Aug 7, 2018 at 3:14 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:42:01.976620,milegeo,More of this please!,"It is beautiful, informative, and engaging!","Sep 11, 2018 at 5:30 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:01.992578,jagold51,Disappointed,It was the perfect wasted of money and I just started on this gaming quest.,"Aug 31, 2018 at 8:34 AM",1, 0,We would love to hear more about your opinion! We hope you will change your mind by the time you finish whole story!
2022-05-28 16:42:05.128191,SpotlessCitizen,Short,Keep in mind that you will finish it in less than an hour.,"Jul 27, 2018 at 6:59 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:05.143151,ATISDECONTA,Distractive and very instructive,"This VR pre-release is yet perfectly complementary to ""normal"" documentaries, as it allows you to take your time to visit and see from inside the structures and the way it works. Graphics are nice and self-transparency, upon your position, is very clever and well done.
Certainly the best way to visit a touristic or technologic place.
Thousand Thanks for your nice work.","May 28, 2018 at 4:17 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:05.158112,Denis347,,"Really great educational app. Very well polished. One thing I would really love is human scale on various positions throughout the dam. For example I want to be able to stand on that bridge, and admire the beauty and the size of the dam construction. Please add this and I'm gonna love this even more!","May 13, 2018 at 7:56 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:42:05.172073,Aquavemo,Excellent work!,"Aside from the high quality of presentation and information i was impressed by all the little details that definitely add to the experience. I lost myself a bit watching the tiny cars driving around on the streets and in the parking lots, the kayak and boat in the water or even aircraft in the sky. Power lines buzzing when you near them etc. Now imagine something like this as part of google maps in the future for places around the world!","May 12, 2018 at 7:59 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:42:05.187033,snapper74,Excellent!,"Really enjoyed this. Nice to see some quality educational content taking advantage of VR.

One very minor and picky comment - there are a couple of typos (one of them an option on  the main menu). Doesn't affect the experience, but should be corrected as everything else is first class!","May 18, 2018 at 6:37 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:08.294721,monsenrm,,Great job.  The graphical depictions are supurb and along with the well made audio makes for a very informative experience.  I particularly liked the transparent sectioning visuals which cutaway the dam parts but allow you to look at individual parts in isolation.  Looking forward to more applications from IndustrialVR!,"Mar 18, 2018 at 2:44 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 16:42:08.310679,Kevin_Brook,"Highly polished, educational title","For the price this is a surprisingly polished experience with a helpful tutorial, quality narration, excellent visuals, and some really neat, and instructive animations. For anyone who has even a passing interest in science and energy, or engineering, or just wants to learn more about a great engineering and structural marvel this application will certainly enlighten and entertain.
I found it intuitive to use and to get around and its encouraged me to learn more about the dam, and then revisit this to better appreciate the technical information, which on first watch, is a bit over my head. This is a good thing as it encourages you to actively learn.
For the price its absolutely a five star review. I can't wait to see their upcoming tours of an oil rig and the Fukushima nuclear reactor.
If I could make one suggestion I would love to see the option to view the dam at a fixed human scale. The graphics are gorgeous but you view it as a table top model for the most part. I really wanted to see it as large as it really is.
You can get a sense of this by viewing it in Google Earth, and checking the fixed human scale option in that application. You'll be able to much better appreciate the scale of the structure then, as well as get a good look at Lake Meade and the surrounding mountainous landscape. 
Using both apps combined has given me a real appreciation for the dam and I intend to revisit it in both programmes again very soon!
Also, ignore the 1 star review below. Unfortunately somebody always has to be that guy...","Apr 15, 2018 at 5:55 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:42:08.325639,andrei.sircuta,Small and boring,"It is well done, but it is very small and boring. I can learn same thing for free from youtube.","May 17, 2018 at 1:28 PM",2, 3,"We glad you liked quality, I wish we can do more within available time frame for development! At this point ~25 minutes of animations available.
What kind of features would you like to see in this type of applications?"
2022-05-28 16:42:08.340599,SaleemIbnSultan,Awesome!,"Nice and helpfull Tutorial helped me to understand how to play and use all available functions. Very high details of: graphics, textures and gameplay. It's really easy and interest to teleport and be able to see everything, from different positions, - it's like visit real Dam. Even better and more flexebility. It should be best practice for education! I hope some an others location like that will be available soon. Great job, guys! Thank you!","Mar 17, 2018 at 5:10 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:42:08.354561,Tran,Love this app! Great quality & content!,"This is such a fun, well made, educational app. I love the details and getting into the innerworkings of Hoover Dam!","Apr 5, 2018 at 4:21 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:42:11.435322,beergut88,Very educational content,It's good to see some quality educational content . Feels like you're experiencing one of the Discovery / National Geographic channel motion graphics with a narrator delivering explainations while you navigate around. Very well done.,"Mar 30, 2018 at 9:01 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 16:42:11.466239,rh_galaxy,Why do you have to stand?,"Sitting with an xbox controller is so much more comfortable, than standing with the touch moving your arms around... it is possible to design this without touch.

Update, It wasn't fair at all with a 1 star before... I do appreciate the effort that's been put into it.","Apr 27, 2018 at 6:56 PM",3, 1,"rh_galaxy, we are working very hard guys to get player`s attention and gather feedback. Your opinion is really valuable and totally make sense and we already working on xbox based version of input, its just takes time and efforts to develop for VR. 1 star is really killing review and we hope you could change your mind and reconsider it :) We are working on next scenes and if you want to look at whats coming send me email at game@industrialvr.info"
