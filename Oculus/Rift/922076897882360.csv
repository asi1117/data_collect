2022-05-28 16:41:23.093618,Deeperbeige,Weird controls,"Strange, unintuitive controls and menus ruin what should be a fun puzzler. Games like this are my 'thing' so I should love it. But it's way too fiddly to be fun past the first couple of levels.","May 21, 2020 at 10:28 PM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 16:41:23.136503,FastLawyer,"Have to play roomscale, open tiny door","As the title says, to get the full enjoyment of this game, you have to go full roomscale and make sure you have enough space.  So if you're a giant and the puzzles are tiny, then you need to change settings.  Look at the edge of the puzzle landscape, closest to you, and you'll see a tiny door.  Open the door and look through it.  Move the switch.  Voila!  Now the puzzles are giant and you're normal sized.  This makes a big difference because now you'll be able to build a lot easier (no tiny pieces to deal with) and your contraptions will move more like you want because now you can manipulate the pieces better.  And even though there are only 4 pieces to work with (5 if you count the pins to pop the pieces), you do have to make the contraptions in creative ways. Anyways, if you liked my review or found it helpful, then please thank me by clicking helpful :D","Sep 5, 2017 at 2:21 AM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 16:41:26.272117,jon,A game for which the moment has passed,"When the Rift and Vive were first released there was a window in which this would have been one of the more interesting games available, but that time has passed.

Now it straddles a line somewhere between too simplistic to be enduringly entertaining and not quick enough to get into to remain installed as a VR demo.","Sep 13, 2017 at 9:51 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 16:41:26.286080,jslpmec,Extremely poor menu and setting design,"The game seems like it could be fun, and the few levels I have played are somewhat enjoyable. The menu/setting system is only accesible via desktop, meaning you have to take your headset off. The very short tutorial explains how to grab and move things and thats it. How do you access the menu? How  do you reset the level? Very frustrating when it bugged on me on level 2 and all the pieces flew out into space, and I did not know how to retrieve them or reset the level. Saving your contraptions or viewing other online contraptions is unintuative and is not properly explained. As far as I can tell, to reset a level, you have to restart the entire game, and begin from the tutorial? Maybe that is not true, but the fact that I can't tell even after doing some digging is an indicator as to how POOR the menu design is. I got this through the bundle sale going on the store right now, and I absolutely regret getting this game even at a discount. It is INCREDIBLY frustrating dealing with the meny/setting system.
Depending on how you set up your play area, you may not be in a good position to work on the level. Since there doesn't seem to be any sort of locomotion available in the game besides moving your actual body, you may need to reset the play area so that you can reach certain areas (maybe something that is too far above you). Guess what though, you need to use the options menu that is ONLY available on the desktop to do so, then go back in your headset to set up your area. I have found that if you try to reset your area in the middle of a level, when you go back to it, all items are frozen and you can't move anything. The only way to fix it is a restart.
I feel like I have spent most of my time in this game trying to get past some sort of bug or navigating the menu/settings instead of actually playing the levels.","Jul 28, 2017 at 5:36 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 16:41:26.300042,valdark2,,Fun and clever game concept.   I had some minor issues with controls but nothing major.   The kids loved it.,"Aug 21, 2017 at 11:04 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:41:26.315002,timeball,The Ultimate Puzzle Game,"With very little guidance, the game allows you to solve puzzles in anyway you want ... there's no one right answer to any puzzle.  I've really enjoyed racking my brain, and my 4-year old has enjoyed watching me and giving his suggestions for the perfect contraption.","Jul 4, 2017 at 7:34 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:41:26.329962,Flig,Great in 2D,"The VR hands are getting stuck all the time and don't always go where you want them to. I just gave up after the 2nd puzzle - too frustrating. 
I'm using an NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti running on an i7-6700k CPU @ 4GHz with 16GB RAM over 150mb connection. I didn't think I'd have problems like this.
Unless there's a very quick fix to this I would recommend this anyone.","Jun 19, 2017 at 4:31 AM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 16:41:29.442637,doublee22,Puzzles done right,"This game is a good game to kill tons of time in. Difficult puzzles will rack your brain. The puzzles do get kind of repetative, though. I can only make a rolling cart in so many various ways.","May 30, 2017 at 4:49 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 16:41:29.456599,Sakkura,"Great game, TERRIBLE settings","The actual game is charming and the physicality of the puzzles is great.

The settings and menus are EXTREMELY bad though.","Mar 19, 2017 at 6:46 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 16:41:29.486519,highport,"Correctly titled, fantastic","This game really has potential to absorb hours and be a big-kids lego set. Really great. Highly suggest having a very good 360 setup as any occlusion will drive you insane trying to build things. Also, the menu system appears on the desktop and not in-game, which is extremely counter-inuitive for changing the scale/setup of the environment. Still, a must-own for engineering minds!","Dec 16, 2016 at 9:55 AM",4, 13,
2022-05-28 16:41:32.581242,Virtuix_,"Hours of fun, truly fantastic","Firstly, I'd like to start by saying there ARE actually settings in game. If you look on the edge of the island you're building on, you'll see a tiny little door; open it and peep through and you'll see an option to switch it to room-scale, and an option to reset the island size. I personally think this is a really cute and fun (maybe not practical, though) way of accessing the settings. 

This really is a great game which can provide hours of fun. The overall theme of the game is very nice and silly, with lot's of fun easter eggs to play around with. There are hundreds of different levels and an infinite amount different contraptions to make, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax and have fun.

As stated previously, although not essential I'd strongly recommed a good 360 setup, especially if you're playing in roomscale mode.","Jan 22, 2017 at 11:56 PM",5, 8,

The Settings menu is on your desktop and not in VR. If you need to reset the size or height, take off your HMD!","Dec 21, 2016 at 3:57 AM",5, 8,
