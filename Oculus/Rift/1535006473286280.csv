2022-05-28 19:29:01.693521,mrogtadude,Could be better,Its a pretty fun game but im so frustrated when i command a tank to move and seconds later it explodes because it ignored my command. This happens every single time.,"Oct 17, 2020 at 5:50 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:29:01.708481,savagebeest,awesome little tank game,"its fun and definately a keeper but the turret sound has got to sound more quiet or add a more realistic sound. 

the graphics arent AAA so dont go expecting your 10 bucks to be world of tanks graphics. its a simple tank vr game and its in the right direction. 

dev you want my opinion? keep working on this one. its a gem. we are now entering the world of vr tanks. you have the tiger by its tail. 

sounds could use some work but its pretty darn good. remember guys this is low budget apps. i bet if this dev had lots of funding he/she would have definately added a lot more. 

gameplay is superb. i think other tank vr games need to learn from this dev. im sooo glad they didnt opt for touch sensor control thank god. the thumbsticks work flawless. thank you. 

all in all its worth more than what they are asking here so give it a try.","Apr 17, 2019 at 4:06 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 19:29:01.723441,xhadow,Needs work,"My first impression was the very very low quality graphics, the lowest I have seen so far. It needs much better gfx/engine to be more realistic. Also static world, cant run over anything. On the first level where do you go to finish it?? Destroyed all tanks, left with a group of soildiers not following orders just sitting donwn. Got some motion sickness.

You have the base game but I would happily pay full price for a more realistc experience.

graphics: extremely low
ordering system: very good
targeting: too simple
sound: good","Mar 7, 2019 at 11:32 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:29:01.738401,daeheru53,"Good game, could be better","This game has tons of potential.  I bought it after reading some of the reviews.  Hope to see improvement in the areas I pointed out to the Devs in an email, so I wont go into it here.  As the first VR tank sim Ive tried its pretty good if it was more immersive Id rate it 5 stars.  I dont think there is much negative to say about the game it just needs work.  People if you buy it give it time the devs are active and engage their player base which is something we all want in a developer  (Devs the email explains that immersive comment)","Jan 6, 2019 at 10:24 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:29:01.754358,AgogePS,"Very cool game, could be amazing","The game is pretty awesome.  I'd like to see this built on and brought to the next level.
  That being said, I hate the targeting system.  I need binocs and optics, and the arbitrary system needs to be replaced by, distance, target, ammo type fire.  Nothing worse than being engaged and not being able to return fire due to the engine or funky setup.","Feb 17, 2019 at 4:59 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:29:04.874014,Holmesboy,Not bad for the price,"I absolutely love WWII armor so I was excited to see this. It's actually very well polished with good voice acting. The scenerios are bit linear, and it took me more than once to figure out what I was supposed to do. The controls are decent. The tank movement is a bit exagerated with exagerated terrain and no deformation. Being a VR veteran I even felt a little naseous as the tank quickly lurches around with no real momentum. It doesn't exactly drive like a real tank. I would definitely love to see it done a little more realistically, because it's caught somewhere between a causal action game and strategy game, which makes it dificult to pin down what exactly it is. It doesn't feel like you're really the tank commander as you seem to be driving the tank from your unbuttoned cupola in combat (yikes!) but you can't directly fire the gun- you just tell your gunner what to shoot at. All-in-all I'd say it's a fun VR experience if you enjoy tanks and WWII subject material especially for the price.","Feb 6, 2018 at 11:02 AM",3, 14,"Thanks for the thoughtful feedback! If you can spare a moment sometime, please drop me a line at support@mojo-games.co to elaborate on which aspects of realism you would most like to see improved so that I can focus on those in an update. I would also love to talk with you more about the tank's momentum and handling and anything else you would like to see. Either way, thanks again for taking the time to provide some feedback!"
2022-05-28 19:29:04.889972,Jesusavesouls,Very fun and realistic.,It is very fun using the motion controls and commanding the other parts of the platoon.I would like to see more alternate veiws of the tank.Interior and possible be able to be a foot soldier.I can command my troop to go where my tank cant move.Would be nice to have a full accessible map.Praise Jesus!,"Feb 7, 2018 at 6:10 AM",5, 5,"Thanks much for the kind words! I would love to know more about the features you want to see such as the tank interior: do you want to be able to ""button up"" to protect yourself from enemy fire and make the unbuttoned position vulnerable, or do you want to actually become the gunner, for example? Similar questions about playing as infantry. If you would drop a line to support@mojo-games.co then we can discuss your ideas and figure out how to make the game better with them. Thanks again for taking the time to send feedback!"
