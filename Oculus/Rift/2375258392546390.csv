2022-05-28 19:41:29.932713,stoni_VR,A simply shooter i was looking for,"For the Developer okay everything works fine now (sidesteps) Thank you. I can start to enjoy your game now and i like what i see so far its pretty dark reminds on Dead space, Doom and co. U can play like serious sam with two hands or like old shool shooter with one hand now. The msooth turn is good u can make it nice fast. For this price its good.","Sep 23, 2020 at 12:11 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 19:41:29.961635,FastLawyer,There's a reason it goes on sale for $1,"Yeah it's not a very good shooter. Doom-clone FPS shooter for VR sounds exciting. However, think of this game like it plays almost like old-school Doom 3, only with worse enemy AI and bad weapon handling, with very ugly graphics and poor lighting on the Unreal Engine. Enemies spawn out of nowhere from all corners of the map where all doors lock behind you. You shoot at dumb enemies in the dark. You run and gun to avoid damage out in the open or hide behind a barrier and shoot at enemies while they line up for you like lambs to the slaughter. That is this game. It may be worth it for 1 buck, if you're really bored and really need a Doom-clone fix.","Apr 15, 2020 at 11:41 AM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 19:41:29.976595,LordDrunken,not the best,I found this game diffcult to get in to after time of playing i found the mechanics boring,"Sep 29, 2020 at 11:10 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:41:33.173179,Drawhen,Gameplay 100% like Quake and Doom,"You move through big, dark space inviroments and fight fast shootouts against hordes of enemys. I like that the game is so dark and the action is absolute oldshool like Quake and Doom. Therefore 2 Stars. If you play further you find really good weapons which are fun to use. But what this game needs to get a higher rating is snapturn and a headlight. Only having the shoutgun as flashlight is not good enough. And smooth turn makes puke. I also discovered two bugs. Using the first elevator in the game on my way to the third terminal which I need to destroy i felt through the wall in endless space. Next bug is the waypoint at the third terminal. I destroyed the thrid terminal during the firfight. After all enemies where gone the way point did not refresh but the terminal was already destroyed. Maybe the developers would like to fix this. I contacted the developers on there website, asked the place of the savegame file directory and where to find it. Never  get an awnser from them. So for missing support I reduced my review from 3 Stars to 2 Stars.","Oct 15, 2020 at 2:15 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 19:41:33.267922,JonnyJamesC,Good budget shooter,"No triple A but good fun and plenty of content for your money.  Despite what the 360 warning says the game can easily be played sitting as you can turn 360 play off in the settings and turn with analog sticks. There is an up to date demo on the  games website. 
My only complaint is there is no vibration rumble from the Touch controllers when firing weapons which can make the weapons feel a little weak.","Feb 24, 2020 at 9:29 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:41:33.307815,skullflash,Cheap nasty game with fake reviews.,"Where do I start it looks ok (probably original assets) but proportions are all wrong, gun sounds are really weak, pretty much all sound effects are of low quality and just bad.  All the talking is out of sink and boring, the guns are under powered and it seems to me this was just thrown together to stitch up gamers for some quick cash!
 its just really, really bad gameplay,  Nothing like Doom. To late for me to refund but I wouldn't pay 20p for this heap if I had known how bad it was!!","Dec 31, 2019 at 3:42 PM",1, 6,

2022-05-28 19:41:42.810271,Ruined,Mix of Serious Sam and Event Horizon,"I've played the game for an hour or so and below are my impressions.

This is a fun shooter with a retro feel to it similar to the game Serious Sam.  Like Serious Sam, the graphics are simple but effective.  However, unlike that game the setting is dark and gritty much like the move Event Horizon.  The game is fairly polished with only a few quirks, and overall is quite fun.

I would recommend that this mainly be purchased by those who have their ""VR legs"" and feel comfortable with full locomotion games like Dreadhalls as you have to turn, strafe and run FAST in this game while firing.  

Overall a good effort.","Jun 21, 2019 at 10:18 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:41:45.896601,xjawa3,Total warzone!,"This game is so good. Plenty of enemies and well designed weapons, sounds and effects. The survival maps are total warzones with very cool game mechanics. The campaign is simple but very good with lots of cool combat arenas.  There are many titles out there that are more expensive and have much less combat and very poor graphics, this game has very dated graphics and effects. Recommended!","Aug 14, 2019 at 1:58 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:41:45.912558,Starunionz,Great VR Shooter,"If you like FPS like doom, deadspace or serious sam this is a real deal. The graphics are very good so does the designs of the enemies and weapons. With many enemies coming from all directions and the sound effects this makes you feel like you are in a real SciFi combat situation. Great game!","Aug 1, 2019 at 12:50 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:41:45.927519,Davidx09,OMG! Epic Shooter!,This game is so cool! For the price point is definitely a must have! If you like doom style gameplay this is the game.

2022-05-28 19:41:45.941985,sulivan.265,Best VR Scifi - Horror - Shooter,"I initially gave 4 stars to this game but I will give it the 5 stars since the developers are constantly adding new and exiting content to this game. Every week they release new maps, add new weapons and enemies etc. The combat mechanics is very good with the quick shotgun selection which is pretty unique, some weapons have 2 fire modes and there are plenty of different enemies each with unique abilities. The campaign and the survival maps are great with cool music background that makes the game feel like a combination of DOOM and Deadspace with its Immersive atmosphere with cool sounds and particle effects. BTW best graphics I have seen in a VR Shooter title.","Mar 18, 2019 at 7:08 AM",5, 9,

My Thoughts:
Not the greatest looking action shooter, but it's fast paced and energetic. If you like the movement style of original games like Doom and Dead Effect 2, you'll probably have a lot of fun with this one.
The game feels a bit janky at times but makes up for it with its atmosphere and combat.","Feb 1, 2019 at 3:53 PM",3, 8,"We have just released a new patch with improved game mechanics, designs, sounds, effects and more content! Thank you for your support!"
2022-05-28 19:41:49.070235,Zteelx,Fun game with a lot of action!!,High pace horror/action/sci-fi game with a lot of action. A lot of weapons that come of great use depending the situation. Immerse music that create the suspense and change to a rush of adrenaline during action. A lot of fun combat. One of my favorite action VR game so far.,"Feb 2, 2019 at 3:28 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:41:49.086192,Scott-Jon,One of the best VR action shooters,"Very immersive atmosphere, graphics, and sounds as well as satisfying weapon selection + gameplay. It's a single player campaign for fans of Doom / Painkiller / Serious Sam. The spartan futuristic music adds to the sci-fi immersion as well. 
-
Looking forward to more explosive objects throughout the campaign to add some tactical spice, as well as more enemy types for variety (apparently both are coming soon).

IMHO this is a high quality VR action game that is relatively unknown simply due to lack of marketing.  Highly recommended.","Mar 24, 2019 at 3:56 PM",5, 8,

These make this game one of my favorite VR shooters. Plenty of selections to personalize your gameplay including single weapon mode, difficulty, movement rotation and extra features. Not a multiplayer title but for the price tag this is a great game. The survival maps are intense and will for sure test your vr combat skills.","Mar 11, 2019 at 4:22 AM",5, 12,

I have been playing this game for about 4 days and I love it! The single player campaign is very good with lots of different scenarios and enemies plus very cool sound effects. 
I reported some issues with the gameplay and the next day the developers release a patch that fixed them which is good!","Feb 4, 2019 at 10:51 PM",5, 10,

There are many games out there that are more expensive and are just a complete disapppointment. If you like single player campaigns like doom or deadspace this is a good option. Hope they lunch in the future a multiplayer mode, my guess is that the game has a lot of potential for multiplayer and will be a lot of fun.","Feb 3, 2019 at 12:40 AM",4, 6,

The combat experience is very good and with nice graphics, probably one of the best graphics I have seen in VR. The music gets you exited and makes you feel like you are about to kill everything around you. 
The campaign is good and the sound effects/voices sound great. 
I only hope they update the game for multiplayer which is why I am giving it 4 stars.","Feb 1, 2019 at 4:22 AM",4, 5,Thank you! We will launch the multiplayer servers after we have enough users with new maps and game modes. We will notify the community for any updates.
