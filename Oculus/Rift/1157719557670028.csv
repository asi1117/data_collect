I look forward to any upgrades you feel like making to the game, especially more animals and different swim patterns.  Great under water adventure !","Jan 21, 2021 at 8:11 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:43:21.070449,Angelina Starr,Absolutely stunning!,"And with great game play too.  The visuals are awesome.  I love the sinking ships descending down to the sea floor around my underwater command center.  Nice touch!

I will gladly bump to 5 stars once they make this multiplayer.  It will be as close to perfect as you can get, then.  

(Note to devs - I solved the issue with the missiles I mentioned earlier.  Fault was on this end.  Learned I need to drop them into the blocks and not try to place them in the blocks.)

For $6 bucks, USD, you can't go wrong however.  Best bang for the buck for sale on Oculus.

PS:  And everything VibrationsOfDoom said.

EDIT!  Finally got my VR room built and got my Rift plugged back in - Multiplayer!  And then some.  Thanks!  Updated to 5 stars.","Jul 4, 2019 at 9:39 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:43:21.086405,VibrationsOfDoom,"Absolutely spellbinding, amazing scenery","What an amazing experience! When you talk about great value for the money, this is by far and above HANDS DOWN a MUST purchase for ANYONE... It's the battleship game we all know and love, but there are TONS of impressive features! Watching the torpedoes hit the board you're firing from was a plus, but watching those suckers come down and explode on a miss?!? Priceless! You're in an underwater cage setting everything up and off, and the visuals are an absolute TREAT! I freaked out the first time I watched one of my own ships come crashing down to the sea floor, and land with a THUD! Not 100 yards behind me! One thing I will suggest to the developers, though, is I think the thudding of the ships should be a bit louder and more ""dramatic."" Also, one other complaint is I can;t figure out how to ""input"" my name for the scores table! There's a touchable keyboard and numeric pad but it's never really explained how to use them, and they're difficult to activate. Still, seeing sharks, and a really freaky octopus crawling up the side of the cage I'm in. Sharks, sea turtles, all swimming VERY close to where you are!

And if that wasn't enough (which it was for me), seeing the ships up close in the menu screen was nice. AND, there's a few other play options like a ""career"" path and what not, but man, this should EASILY be a $20 game! The replayability is through the roof, and sometimes my game play slows WAY down so I can watch ships sink to the ocean floor. I could go on and on all day, but WOW what an incredible VR experience. Outside the box thinking by the developers makes for a very unusual and highly immersive experience... THIS game takes a 2D format and makes it interactive and beyond 3D levels...","Jan 21, 2019 at 5:39 AM",5, 2,"Hi 
Just wanted to say thanks a lot for the very kind review. I'm very happy you liked the game so much. I set out to build the best vr battleships game I could. Reviews like this make that effort worth while.

For the high scores it uses your Oculus username. The keyboard and phone are just extras for the environment. You can however dial 911 and 800 on the phone for a little easter egg

Another interesting touch is the radar, when a ship sinks the beeps on the radar will show the position of the falling ship.

Happy gaming
Mike"
2022-05-28 19:43:21.101366,xhadow,Want refund :(,"After purchase installed, then wanted to play weeks later, did not show up in library, now just says bought, can't reinstall/download. No help from oculus, can't refund as it has gone too long. Have bought several games, this is the only one with this problem.","Apr 21, 2019 at 10:50 PM",1, 1,"Hi, I'm sorry you are having issues with installing and playing the game. The last thing I want is someone to be unhappy with one of my games. I thinks its a little unfair to rate my game one star due to an issue with Oculus software. However I can appreciate your frustration after spending your money and unable to play. Please email me mike@focusvr.co.uk to discuss."
2022-05-28 19:43:24.235115,Roly_Poly,Worth Full price Easy,"I realy think 6,- is a good price, and every one who likes the boardgame Neval Battle should try this one. you wont need to play alot matches to get your money worth out of it :)","Oct 23, 2017 at 10:33 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:43:24.253067,Orsetti,Battleship at it's finest,"Salvo is a battleship game. The good old battleship we played in school with pen and paper. You have a 10x10 grid and set your ships on it, then the opponent has to fire and find all of your ships. You do the same and better be faster at it. So far, so old school.

But Salvo is a fun VR version of battleship. That means, you are sitting in a kind of cage under water, where you can see underwater mountains, sharks and dolphins swimming by, I even saw a group of waterturtles there. You can see and hear whales and sonarpings and this is already quite impressive and immersive.

But there is more to that game. It has some kind of a career mode, where you have to become Fleet admiral. You see a tactical map with hexagons in front of you. Some of these hexagons are green. You control them. Others are white, these still are neutral. And some of them are red. There you have to win. To become fleet admiral you will have to win 150 battles. There is more to it, but this is not a full test, so I stop now. You really have to experience it for yourself.

So... everything is great, great fun and if you like battleship games, this one is the best I found to date. It is just done pretty cool.

Let's talk now about the elephant in the room. I know, the missing multiplayer is a dealbreaker for some of you. So I contacted Mike, the developer of the game and he answered me, that the current installment base of the game is simply too small for putting in the effort to make network code into the game. So first of all: if you like battleship games, buy this game and tell the developer, you would like to have multiplayer. 

So I can only give you the advice: Buy that game, have fun with it, because even without multiplayer it is made in such a beautifull and cool way, that it is more than worth its money. The AI is pretty good, but I never had the feeling, it is cheating. Support the developer and let him know, that you want multiplayer support in this game.","Jul 24, 2017 at 5:08 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:43:24.270022,The-Pointy-End-,Great adaptation,"If you enjoy Battleships then this is a must buy!

The controls are easy to use and the gameplay is quick to pick up. The variety of missions means you don't get bored quickly and makes it good value for money. 

The environment for the control room is the best part, making full use of the opportunity VR provides.

Few downsides, unless you really hate the game Battleships - in which case I would not recommend.","Jul 21, 2017 at 1:50 AM",5, 2,

If there is one thing you can’t take away from this game it is how good it looks. The way you play the game hasn’t changed much since it was made in 1915, but this version is the best I have ever seen. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, good old battleships in stunning VR, love it and for under a fiver on the oculus store I'd deffo recommend this, great animation and addictive game play although I've only played the classic mode.﻿ - YouTube Comment------------------------------------------------------------------Video Reviews

""It really does create a great atmosphere too difficult to play in, it really is perfect""
""I've played so many versions of battleships from the DS version to countless pc incarnations of it, but by far this is the best one""
