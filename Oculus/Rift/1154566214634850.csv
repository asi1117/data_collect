2022-05-28 15:37:46.815231,Inoculant,i love it,"this game is great, but the controls are different from other climbing mehanics in other games. the only problem that i see is that the multiplayer is dead, and to fix that i think that the devs should make players unlock more levels using multiplayer as an alternative to the singleplayer medals, and there should also be singleplayer levels that are only unlockable via multiplayer. other than a few very, very minor flaws, this game is amazing and i highly recommend it, as it is easily worth the money.",Dec 19 at 4:15 AM,5, 10,

2022-05-28 15:37:46.860111,Dark_Sol,"Finally, a game that's fun on VR",Only reasons I'm giving it 4 stars are that the music is repetitive after a while and I can't get the yellow arrows to disappear even though I turned off seated mode. Beyond that this game is a blast to play. Found myself enjoying a VR game for once and that's pretty rare.,"Oct 24, 2020 at 3:16 PM",4, 52,
2022-05-28 15:37:46.875071,trevmeister,So good.,"After playing Windlands and Jet Island, I was looking for another game to scratch the same itch.  This is that game.  

At first I was annoyed at the limitations and quirks of the way this game handles movement (I nearly returned the game), but after sticking with it for a few levels and getting the hang of it I was completely hooked.  

Of the three games mentioned (Windlands, Jet Island, To The Top), this one probably has the least freedom of movement.  However, that movement is nuanced and very satisfying to master, and the limitations are more than made up for with excellent level design.   I highly, HIGHLY recommend!","Jul 29, 2020 at 12:24 AM",5, 62,

2022-05-28 15:37:50.029634,nevyn,Unpolished but fantastic mechanics,"At first it felt a bit unpolished, even in the basic controls. But once you get used to the leaping and swinging movement, it becomes super intuitive. The levels become great fast-paced puzzles. Love it. I also love the Mirror's Edge-inspired aesthetic and gameplay :)

oh yeah and the music is great!!","Aug 7, 2019 at 2:18 AM",4, 31,

No matter how I go in, I can't help but be in a good mood every time I play this game.

42 games in my library right now and this is my favorite.","Jul 3, 2019 at 12:49 PM",5, 24,
2022-05-28 15:37:53.174223,coolguy1076,Mirror's Edge in VR Done Right,"This is one of those games where it is difficult to convey how fun it is in a trailer; you just have to play it. Requires skill and dexterity, more than I thought it would. What a blast!","Jul 8, 2019 at 10:15 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:37:53.189183,Hanover,"Not Bad, But Needlessly Frustrating","I really like this game.  Unfortunately you can only grab onto blue areas and there are too many times you land right in the middle of an orange area with nothing to grab onto.  The only thing you can do is go back to the last checkpoint and try again.

There needs to be a way to be able to get yourself out of those areas without having to go back to the last checkpoint as it makes the game come to a crashing halt.  For example, there is a place in the last level in the easy set of levels where you're supposed to land on a rail and ride it down, unfortunately without any sort of self-reference (like feet, body), it's easy to miss.  So you spend 10 minutes trying to move forward out of that part.  Instead, I just gave up, quit and went to play Beat Saber.  This game should stop requiring you to be precise, because the movement itself is NOT PRECISE.  You sort of go where you look, but you can never tell how high or how far you're going to jump.  So you quickly lose momentum and everything comes to a standstill.","May 19, 2019 at 8:09 AM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 15:37:53.203146,Crspy_Bacon,,"Yes, the game is fun but that is if you have the patience to get over the bugs. You can be doing so well on your way to getting a new speed run reccord when you slip and you haver to restart all over again because the game dosnt let you get back on track. Sadly this game could turn into something amazing but at its current stage is not the best game to spend your money on.","Jun 2, 2019 at 10:12 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 15:37:56.317815,Graphic,Misleading,"Not at all like the trailer. You're basically just pointing ant clicking to move between objects. You can't throw yourself with your hands as when you grab something you cannot move your body, you can only click to essentially teleport to another grabbable object in about a 4 ft radius around you. Not like the climb at all.","Mar 20, 2019 at 5:21 AM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 15:37:56.332775,Samosza,So good!,"To the top is one of my absolute favourite VR games so far and I have tried and played quite a lot. The locomotion feels just awesome and it's just so much fun to throw oneself through the air. I love the level design. The game is challenging and once you are in the flow there is nothing better. The soundtrack is dope and it's also a pretty intense workout. :-) For people who get motion sick easily it might not be the best choice. But there is also a ""seated mode"", which I haven't tried yet.","Mar 20, 2019 at 7:42 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:37:56.347735,LeeoSeven,EXTREMELY COOL GAME!!!,"I wasn't sure whether to buy this game or not at first, as it's quite a different genre to the games i usually play but i eventualy decided to trust in the reviews & I am SO glad I did! This game is LOADS of fun to play & is absolutely exhilarating at times! Definitely in my top 3 favourite games on VR (Robo Recall anyone?) ;) It has a fantastic flow to it & runs extremely smoothly on my i5/970. Its nicely customisable too. If I could ask the Dev's for one thing, it would be to add some more songs onto the tracklist, as the music can get a bit repetitive after a while. But for anyone who's thinking of getting this game, my advice is DO IT! You definitely won't regret it. Fantastic game! Overall 9.5/10.
PS. Does anyone else throw their arms back & their head forwards as they cross the finish line like some sort of Olympic Ski-Jumper? Because I do everytime! :D","Mar 3, 2019 at 6:06 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:37:56.362695,kevinkullgren,Very enjoyable game!,I have played almost half of the levels so far and I've had a lot of fun! It is one of my favorite games so far. I would really recommend this game.,"Apr 11, 2019 at 5:00 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:37:56.377655,mamaluiginumber1,This is My Favorite VR Game,"First off, for $20 you can't go wrong with To The Top. This game offers a unique experience that no VR headset owner should miss no matter their game preferences. To The Top offers 35 vastly different levels which are all creative and mesmerizing in their own right. You may not like all the levels the same but the quantity of mindblowingly awesome levels definitely will supply hours upon hours of some of the most fun you will ever have and im speaking from experience here cause I've put in way more than 100 hours into the playstation version and plan to do the same with the Steam and Oculus versions as well. I believe that the biggest reason people don't buy this game is cause their afraid the free roaming in the game will make them nauseous and I can ensure this is not the case. For those who make this the very first VR game they play, they may get a little nauseous but thats something most will get with playing anykind of VR game for the first time. And if some games make you nauseous and some don't, To The Top will more than likely not make you nauseous. Also the multiplayer is really just the cherry on top, getting some friends to play online with will give you and your buds some of the most chaotic yet fun-filled hours you will share together. The multiplayer offers CO-OP times to beat to get extra AP (To The Top's currency), objects to place in a level to get to the goal faster, and a sense teamwork or fierce rivalry. But before you play make sure you at the very least try get through some of the hard levels before you form an opinion on this game cause those who only get half way through the  medium difficulty levels aren't getting the whole eperience. I could go on and on about To The Top (more than I already have) but this really is a game you must experience yourself.","Dec 25, 2018 at 11:46 AM",5, 30,
2022-05-28 15:37:59.472378,SoakingRich,,"Personally, i think VR is all about Locomotion, i dont like playing games where im just standing in a room, picking up dull objects, pressing buttons and levers. Locomotion and unique ways to manipulate and move around your environment is where VR really starts feeling free and immersive. 

For this reason, To the Top is one of the best. Just a short time it takes to get the hang of it, and you're flying through bright fast paced levels with novel concepts, all using just your hands pressing a single button, its pretty ingenious. 

Its got a great amount of challenges, and the collectibles are really fun to hunt down. The whole thing is just superbly paced and its great to demo to newbies cos the controls are so simple. 

Its a Top 3 game for me Echo Arena/Windlands/To the Top","Dec 16, 2018 at 7:23 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 15:37:59.487338,JU5TINCREDIBLE,To the Top is VRs greatest buy.,The sheet amount of levels in this game INCLUDING multiplayer really make this thing shine. It gives me mad Mario64 vibes but in a 3d first person environment. One of my all time favorite games inside and out of VR. The level design blows my mind and several parts have brought me to tears of joy. I LOVE this title and everybody needs to play it. The rift is a better place with this title.

2022-05-28 15:38:02.657858,NicklausYao,Gave me a massive headache,"It's an interesting concept and pretty fun, but there are a pretty long list of downsides...

1. For some reason, this particular game really gave me a headache and I really don't get nauseous easily. 

2. Why cant I push off with one hand? At what real point (other than forced situations) will you be required to go one hand at a time? It really destroys the rythym. 

3. The look to jump method is not intuitive at all.

4. I'm not sure if this is something I can turn off, but the trailers are compeletly different than the game because it does have that extremely annoying hexagon circle that clouds the corner of your vision every single time you jump off. It's like a bad game of peekaboo and messes with my head. (actually this is probably why I have a headache).

5. I have a 360 play space sensor and everytime I turn around there are floating arrows in the middle of the screen telling me to turn around, if you can turn these off, please tell, I couldnt find it. 

6. The reach could be longer. Since we are already breaking physics with a 5 foot long grabber, it would be great to extend the reach of the hands to about the distance of a jump (around double) so if you accidentally over jump a lip, you can quickly reach back and catch yourself.

7. Is it necessary to only have blue surfaces as grabbable? Is there a technical limitation or just design? If it's design then please make all surfaces grabbable as that will make it vastly more fun and improve your flow in moving around. 

tl;dr - Okay game, interesting concept, kinda fun, but the hud gives me a headache and mechanics are not intuitive.","Jan 15, 2019 at 10:41 AM",3, 2,"Hi there Nicklaus, thanks for your feedback. For most of your concerns on the player view you can change this issues in the options either from the main menu or your wrist watch interface while in game. Turning off the seated mode, will remove the arrow indicators. To remove the vignetting around the screen, go to the comfort options and turn off the comfort grid. For the rest, this is the design of the game, we encourage the player to leap as much as possible and stay in the air. For the one hand at time moments this is used for precision grabs going one hand at a time or grabbing with one hand and releasing to not jump. Each level tests these skills in new ways."
