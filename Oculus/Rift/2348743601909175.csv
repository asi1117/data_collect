2022-05-28 15:13:25.637364,Nickmbb,Oculus touch controler,"I want to give this a good review and more stars BUT after playing the Wiz tower and the courtyard, once you go into the main game, it is too hard to ""gather magic"" using the Oculus touch controler. My arms actually hurt after playing this game and not in a good way.

In response to the developers response below:
UPDATE: In most games, to make a fist you press both the grip button and trigger button. In this game, you need to hold down the grip button - trigger button and press down on the movement joystick - this makes the correct fist to gather magic. It is a little disconcerning because you usually end up moving when you press all three. But otherwise once you get this working, the game is pretty nice, and challegning in many areas. I am changing my stars from 1 star to 4 stars.",Oct 20 at 1:56 PM,4, 4,"Hi - sorry to hear. That definitely shouldn't be that way—are you pulling towards you, closed fist, with palm facing you? It should be generally an effortless motion that requires only barely pulling towards you a short distance. We'll take a look to make sure this isn't a cross-platform issue. Thanks for letting us know!"

2022-05-28 15:13:25.669274,FNAF0221,can't start it,"the game will download but as soon as i start it, it just crashes almost instantly",Jul 29 at 2:58 AM,2, 2,"That's strange, could you update with your computer specs? We'll take a look."

Please let us know if it keeps happening - and feel free to drop a support ticket to Oculus as well, since an install problem sounds like an issue with Oculus' store."

2022-05-28 15:13:28.831815,LtSputnik,Amazing!,"This is such an enjoyable VR experience! Interacting with the enviornment is fun but added to this is that you can find secrets and put ingredients in a cauldron to mix up some spells, along with some mini games. I like the extra characters that pops up which gives it a bit more variation as well. (and bit of a surprise first time!) The Maze is a very good addition and I'd love an even more expanded game like this, maybe with more rooms in the tower to explore and/or alchemy. More hats! But nevertheless, very fun and I find myself coming back to it to just hang around in the amazinging enviornment.","Oct 2, 2019 at 3:50 PM",5, 45,
2022-05-28 15:13:28.846775,JWB415,very same-y,"i got the original Waltz of the Wizard almost as soon as a got my oculus rift, and was exited when i heard about a new version that did cost money, but was supposedly a better game all around. so, i bought this game and messed around for about an hour and a half, and it feels the same. Dont gete me  wrong, its an icredibly fun experence for those new to VR, bu witht the new edition i was hoping for something more. the things they did add were nice touches, but thats it. Nothing really changed at all. This is perfectly fine for people new to VR, but i just personally didnt think the small changes did enough to valadate the price bump, which is 10 dollars, although this feels more like a 5 or 6 dollar experience.","Oct 2, 2019 at 4:45 AM",2, 16,
2022-05-28 15:13:28.861735,All-Gass-No-Breaks,Excellent CROSS-BUY experience!,"If your a fan of Harry Potter or just magic, This is for you! My kids can not stop playing it. I would genuinely like to thank the developers for making the experience cross-buy (You buy it on the Rift you get it free on the Quest & vice versa) So I can now show friends and family this excellent experience on my new Quest! Thank you!","Dec 24, 2019 at 5:07 AM",5, 25,
2022-05-28 15:13:28.877692,Pixels_UK,Love it!,"Fun interaction with objects in a neat VR environment... I don't tend to the the 'shoot'em up' games but loved the Maze, added enough 'fright' into it without it being some boss enemy I had no chance in beating... and REALLY looking forward to any updates or extentions to go back and explore..  THANK YOU!","Aug 18, 2019 at 5:01 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 15:13:31.961444,Geometrican,Gameplay for a few hours or so,"The game is quite magical, it is fun using and creating spells, there are quite many secrets in game but you could probably find all in about an hour, despite this I've come back to this game multiple times, the game is visually pleasing and it is fun being a magician, Comparing the Prices in VR games this game is definitely a steal and I recommend it, Share the fun moments with friends!","Aug 5, 2019 at 1:34 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 15:13:31.975407,FullAlmond,Definitely creative,"The mechanics in this would make a great full game, devs should consider making that.. id buy it 10 times over, spells are fun and creative as opposed to other games usually only having destruction based spells. definitely worth the price, and the time","Jul 12, 2019 at 7:35 AM",5, 24,
2022-05-28 15:13:31.991364,Plurr,,"Great example of a fun and imaginative non-game. It's important for VR to expand in other directions. This is one of the best titles to show to children, I think. One could have wished for more realistic manual handling of objects, but this is kind of a general problem with VR still.","Jul 13, 2019 at 7:21 PM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 15:13:35.136951,hermitcrad,One of my favs,"I have been following this team and this game for a few years now. It was one of the first games I ever got on my Oculus Rift and I always come back to it. It is such a fun experience and I have never had any problems with it. It has the perfect price tag, I would recommend this to anyone. I also can't wait to see what else is coming to the game. It really as expanded since the beginning and I am so excited for the future!","Jul 15, 2019 at 8:08 AM",5, 9,
