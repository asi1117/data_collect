2022-05-28 19:59:50.065748,Unknown_Life_Form,good game just to much glitching,its a fun game concept kind of like hotel rnr or teardow  but the lag ruins it it makes it imposible to play the game and have fun the best moments i had was when it rendered one item,Jan 11 at 1:12 AM,3, 25,
2022-05-28 19:59:50.080708,Spiffycaius,Crashed my entire system.,"Performance really needs optimization, as it crashed my entire system upon trying to play it, and I do have a good computer too, this shouldn't bring my entire system down.

Game wise, while it is a nice concept, execution will need to be redone a bit.",Dec 20 at 6:09 AM,1, 22,
2022-05-28 19:59:50.095668,handmade_fence69,Could be good.,"This game COULD be really good. But unfortunately at the moment the game is very glitchy and laggy despite how good your pc is, if the devs manage to fix that, I believe this game would be great.",Jan 31 at 1:31 PM,2, 5,

2022-05-28 19:59:50.125588,CosySister,Fun concept but needs work,"I really like the idea of a VR break/rage room, but this is way too laggy to play. The sound effects could use some work too so that it really feels like there is an impact to the things you are hitting.",Dec 11 at 10:19 AM,2, 22,
2022-05-28 19:59:53.254337,logan.vanek,the lag is the game itself,"i've been seeing a lot of lag complaints, and it's REAL. not even my RTX 3050 can run it over 3 frams per second. it's clearly the build of the game itself",Jan 11 at 9:02 AM,1, 10,

2022-05-28 19:59:53.312182,byteframe,This one was a little better.,"Not much stuff to destroy besides glass, but it was satisfying to do so. Ran a bit better than the other experience and had quite decent physics, with music and stuff. Not that bad.",Dec 21 at 4:20 AM,3, 9,
2022-05-28 19:59:56.402018,EngineerBot299,Basically a slideshow,This game is very cool in concept but my god it is so horribly executed. It's so horribly unoptimized that it runs like a slideshow. Even the highest end of players have been getting horrible framerates. Definitely fix your game.,Jan 20 at 8:38 AM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 20:00:02.749193,JinAsias,Not bad at all honestly,"It does run a little choppy for some reason but it's far from ""unplayable"" physics are a little messed up but it's what i expect from a free game with only a demo mode lol. The one thing that bugged me personally is the invisible wall is right at the windows and it should be extended out just a bit. 

In short, the game needs updates but for what you pay for it (nothing) it's what i expected personally.",Jan 19 at 6:02 AM,3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:00:02.764153,Griag,Performance is an issue,"you cant play the game becuase of the lag, there needs to be a way to lower the quality or to change settings to make the game run better.",Jan 17 at 9:34 AM,2, 0,
