The gunplay is okay, although it seems to overheat pretty fast. There's powerups and you can use these wooden pop up shields on a timer. There's a few enemy types. But there's only 3 environments. Definitely not worth the full asking price of $10 with such little content. At least I got it on sale for just under $5 and I'm not even sure it's worth that. Should be a $3 game really.","Mar 30, 2018 at 2:14 PM",3, 0,

Oculus does now allow you to get refunds if it just won't work, but if you don't mind my asking, what kind of specs does your pc have? We'd love to solve this if possible."
