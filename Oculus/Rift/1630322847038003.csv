2022-05-28 16:39:10.217015,cybernettr,NOT a comfortable experience,"This app made me uncomfortable – but not in the way intended. It seems to be a textbook case of how to induce VR sickness. First, there’s no snap turning option. I know some people don’t like this, but as a seasoned VR player, not having it still made me queasy. Secondly, direction of movement is controlled not only by the thumb stick but by the direction you are looking, which made me feel drunk! Developers, please make it one or the other, or give players a choice! As for the game itself, graphics were only So so and it was the standard “hospital crawler“ VR horror trope. I’m not dying to buy the other episodes in the series, If you’ll pardon the expression.","Feb 14, 2019 at 6:38 AM",2, 15,

I quit maybe 15mins in ... soon after passing the dead body on the table... so not sure if anything changed as the game progressed.","Jun 29, 2018 at 6:34 AM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 16:39:10.246935,Doum76,Walking froward stucked motion?,"Same as Nrosko a few post below. Seems cool, though i haven't played more than 3 minutes, is it a normal behavior that you keep walking? I just can't stay in place, it's always walking forward, i'm using Touch Controls and sleected as Touch control in menu and they work since in otehr games they work... pretty much annoying and unplayable, can't relaly even walk back as the foreward motion cancel the walking backward. Lol just went to buy an Axbox Controler and issue is stil persistent. Found out my CH Propedals were giving in ghost inputs, got to disable them.","May 27, 2018 at 12:34 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 16:39:10.261895,nightcat.mau,Jump Scares!!!,"I came into the series late and played the second and third games first. Which brought me up to speed. I’m still confused as to how an eight year old girl aged after death into a woman in this title, but that’s horror for you, so did Jason. Yes, there are a ton of jump scares, I cussed plenty, but they were almost fun. Almost. Some started off cute and some were just audio. The ending wasn’t as bad as the first pounce to me as I couldn’t pick up the diary, so I got to see all the frights the hospital has to offer, and some were pretty good. Spoiler alert: the plank bridge, guy in wheelchair and the first female jump scare are the best. 
Since I played the second and final game before this I was pleasantly surprised. It’s longer than the third game, and you have a yappy friend who won’t shut up over the cell, just in case turning on the power didn’t let every ghost in three counties know you are there. Overall it’s fun and more like a laugh in the dark than the other two games. A little cheesy, but in a good way, and if you love jump scare there are plenty in this game. Also, is it me, or is this discount Ringu? And I say that in the most loving was possible.","Mar 25, 2018 at 8:12 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 16:39:10.276856,goreroad,Should not be listed as comfortable,"No teleport so I got a little VR sick and couldn't really enjoy the game. Higher quality horror titles offer a choice on locomotion. Even so, the game has bland graphics, and did not really scare me.","Mar 9, 2018 at 8:29 AM",2, 6,

2022-05-28 16:39:13.397509,Toastclaimer,Far too short to be interesting,"The game has a few decent jump scares, and a fairly good grasp on atmosphere, but its almost 10 minutes long; by the time you feel immersed its over. Story is a total joke and some of the laughably bad models are distracting
But then again, its so cheap, i suppose i cant compain much. Theres still better free games out there though that do this kinda of game better","Jan 4, 2020 at 10:42 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:39:13.412469,Tonio,Trailer Bait,After seeing the trailer i bought the game with good expectations. After playing a few minutes i couldnt take it anymore and quit. All the cheesy jump scares and the fact that everything looked like fake props just made me laugh (at myself for actually buying this game). I felt no vr immersion that made me feel like i was playing a horror game.,"Dec 17, 2017 at 10:47 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 16:39:13.427429,FastLawyer,More than just jumpscares,"I don't agree with the reviewer that says this game is only about jumpscares.  Yes, there lots of jumpscares.  It seems like there's a jumpscare around every corner.  However, you are entering a haunted hospital.  You're trying to find Allison's diary within the godforsaken abandoned hospital in the dead of night alone.  What do you expect will happen?  It's meant to be a cheesy, horror experience.  I think this game does rely on atmosphere more than anything else, even though the pace of the jumpscares can be ridiculous.  Part of the reason for that is because the experience is very short.  It says it's a 10 minute experience, but it felt shorter than that to me.  Either that or I got really lucky in finding the diary.  I was kind of disappointed when I found it so fast because I was afraid it would be the end ... and it was the end.  But it's a nice creepy abandoned hospital that is fun to explore for any horror fan.  I wish there was more use for the touch controls, basically it's just used as a way to hold the flashlight and as a joystick for locomotion.  I did not experience any bugs (but I did experience a big rat) or problems with using the touch controller (no spinning as some other reviewer mentioned and it doesn't emulate touch controls, they work as in any other game that supports touch).  Simple controls, movement is on the slow side, but not painfully so.  You should not feel any motion sickness at this slow pace.  So this is a great game to introduce friends and family to VR although they may not be your friends or family after you make them experience this :D","Dec 4, 2017 at 4:44 AM",3, 11,
2022-05-28 16:39:13.443386,nrosko,Doesn't work,Just has me moving continually in one direction same as the other game Cathedral so i can't control anything.  i have reached out to devs but they have not replied.,"Feb 23, 2018 at 7:23 PM",1, 0,"Hi there, Thank you for playing our games. Please select the proper controller preference in the main menu, and make sure to have yours connected and working. KR Games"
2022-05-28 16:39:16.559053,SwirlyMaple,"Very short, buggy, but a few good scares","My first impression of this game was the worst part of it, because when using the touch controllers, your view rotates around and around with no way to stop the motion. At least that's what it did on my PC. Also, it uses a virtual emulator that makes the touch controllers show up as an XBox 360 controller in Windows, which causes the guardian walls to no longer be activated by the touch controllers until the game is exited. Since this is a standing experience, I think that's a major issue that absolutely needs to be fixed, and the spinning bug obviously needs to be fixed as well. If you use a different control method (remote or Xbox controller), you can at least play without the rotation bug.

Major bugs aside, there are a few gameplay issues with getting into and out of certain rooms, where you have to walk in exactly the right spot or you can't get out/in, even though nothing is visibly blocking your path.

As for the experience, this is essentially a haunted-house style walkthrough. Your route through the hospital is pre-defined, but you can freely explore the rooms available for entry. The atmosphere is pretty creepy, and there are a couple of reasonably good scares, with the rest feeling pretty mediocre to me. There is almost no interaction with the environment, except for opening a few doors and cabinets.

This experience is very, very short. I think it took me less than 20 minutes to go all the way through it. All the negatives aside, it was only five dollars, and it did give me a few reasonably good scares. If the spinning bug were fixed, and keeping in mind the cost, I think it's worthy of 3.5 stars. But as-is at the time of review, it's 2 stars at best.","Nov 23, 2017 at 3:01 PM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 16:39:16.575010,MrUnoriginal,It's okay.,Not really scary. Doesn't really rely on atmospherics. Mostly jump scares that are pretty predictable. Very nausiating. Painfully so. But I gotta give it 2 stars at least for trying.,"Nov 26, 2017 at 6:55 AM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 16:39:16.588973,manulalla,Best version of The Hospital!,"Played it for Gear VR and it was great, but here on Rift it really gives you a 360 feeling of immersion which is freaking terrifying!
