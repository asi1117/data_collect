There's some nice humor to be had, if you like the whole space geek where oddball things happen, involving alien races and or cats.  But once you complete one mission, you pretty much get the idea and I'm not sure you'd really want to do the thing again.  Just a nice little time waster, when you're feeling extra geeky.","Jan 11, 2018 at 3:25 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:09:51.131548,Radi5h,A lot of potential,"The game is fun to play a few times but the fun wears off after you repeat the same missions. 
If there was a minigame to decide the outcomes of actions instead of a probability wheel of fortune it could be a lot more fun. It kindof feels pointless playing when you really have no input into the outcome of your decisions.
The space adventuring is fun but you are encouraged not to explore because the penalties for failure are so high.","Jun 23, 2017 at 5:16 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:09:51.146508,RedJimi,I bite sized adventure in space,"Written as a tongue in cheek Star Trek parody, this game is about choices when it comes down to it. Who will you pick to go with you, how will you respond to each event? There's no rush to it and the aesthetic is enjoyable.
As a trekkie I have to admit one thing bothers me: When starting, you pick a captain and then you watch him stand on your side while you sit in the captains chair. That's just wrong, number one.","Dec 21, 2016 at 8:44 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 18:09:51.161468,friesframe,Fun while waiting for ST: Bridge Crew,"Played a bit of this and really enjoyed it!  My biggest complaint is that it makes you use the controller analog stick to move the cursor instead of just using look controls.  For the price though, it's worth picking up!","Nov 25, 2016 at 5:20 AM",4, 13,
2022-05-28 18:09:51.176428,KablooieXL,A Numbers Game,"After playing the game for a while, the micro mission stories feel less and less important and all you're focussing on are the rewards and penalties of picking a certain action. Low on food but high on fuel? Pick the option that gets you more food at the cost of fuel. Need more crew? Pick the option that gets you more crewmembers at the cost of a bit of food. The stories behind the options hardly seem to matter. The game never gives me the feeling my personal preference towards certain actions lead to any kind of character or storyline progression. To me it feels more like a glorified numbers game where the player is trying to balance his or her resources through given options and chance via a dice rolling minigame game mechanic. I do like the way the 8bit style was carried over to a VR environment, but the lack of environmental interaction is quite prominent. It's a nice little game which tries to do something different with the VR medium and will keep you entertained for a little while, but truth is, the gameplay feels lacking compared to other games in the same pricerange. It's quite clear the game is trying to create a comedic FTL inspired game, but without the feeling of any actual impact of player choice and strategic gameplay that made FTL so much fun, the game just feels quite bare.","Nov 29, 2016 at 7:49 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 18:09:54.298078,MacManInfi,Doesn't make meaningful use of VR,"The developer's hearts are in the right place but I was hoping for more interaction in a 360 degree environment. Instead, everything happens right in front of you on the big screen. Most of the game involves reading text, choosing a text response and reading the text outcome. Doesn't make use of VR other than the 3D environment that you're sitting in. If you're o.k. with space text adventures, FTL is a much better way to go.","Nov 27, 2016 at 4:49 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:09:54.313038,MBchrono,"Fun, but lacking somethin","I really wanted to love this game.  It's just missing something.  The random encounter type of gameplay is fun, but it came off as a bit too silly.  Price point wasn't bad, so I suppose I would recommend this game.  If you can get it on sale, even better.","Dec 5, 2016 at 2:48 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:09:54.327001,Zipy,Fun 8-bit game,"It's worth getting, it is pretty entertaining.","Nov 26, 2016 at 2:30 AM",4, 3,
