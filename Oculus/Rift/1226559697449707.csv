2022-05-28 19:47:39.193626,John_Lockey,"Cool, but needs some work","I was really happy to see this and I had to get it since Im an old school minesweeper nut. Needs a little more work to really be playable tho. Needs some different color tiles for numbers and bombs, the zero tiles should just disapear or be faded out. As it is now its really hard to look out and read the field without colors. Turning with one joystick would be nice. Of course leaderboards so I can have the high score. I know it just was released a week ago, so I hope a few improvements are in the works.....also I noted a sort of bug(it lets you flag numbers without showing it, i solved the normal mode but had -1 bombs because i must have accidentally flagged a number somewhere). Also button responce is slow, like you have to hold down the button usually. Sorry for all the nitpicking, ill rewrite this review and give 5 stars if you make it a bit more playable, just because I love ""mindsweeper. Cheers","Oct 21, 2017 at 1:43 PM",4, 2,
