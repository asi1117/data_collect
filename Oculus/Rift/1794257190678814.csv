2022-05-28 19:28:41.660103,Spliffwood,Joe Esposito wrote a song about me.,"Support this game! It's hours of fun, a great VR experience for both new and old VR users. There isn't another shoot'em up game on the market that compares to this game. There is progression, replayability, and has graphics that mirror the games of yesteryear. Cedric, you da man! Keep the tweeks coming...they matter.

2022-05-28 19:28:41.676061,Richooal,"Good old school fun, but in VR!","This is a brilliantly detailed game. Lots of action, movement and sound. I find I'm spending a lot more time on it than I should.
Good work, best of luck with your next game.","Oct 29, 2019 at 8:10 AM",5, 3,"Thank you Richooal... Ah ah.. Yes, Anceder can be a time eater :)"
2022-05-28 19:28:41.691021,MrRobertson,Awesome game!,"I love everything about this game, gameplay is like an old school arcade with modern tech twist, soundtrack is rad, and has plenty of replay value even with just 5 levels. the upgrades you earn and the acheivements make it fun. Hands down worth buying the full version","Sep 13, 2019 at 9:19 AM",5, 2,Thank you Mr Robertson. Nice and rewarding :).
2022-05-28 19:28:41.704983,VirtuaLieven,It's okay,"This is a 3D-version of an arcade game, and it's really well done, if you like arcades style games. So even you are in VR, you're still looking forward like watching a big screen, so there is not much of immersion, no need to move your head. The gameplay is quite fun, but not much what I like.","Jul 8, 2019 at 8:18 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:44.837605,rchrdcrg,Really underwhelmed.,"I played through two levels on normal and just took the headset off. Everything moved so slowly... the enemies, bullets, my ship... it felt like I was playing through mollasses. It feels like a mediocre NES shmup quickly remade in VR. I would love the controls to actually be 1:1 and not like a traditional controller with a max speed. I would love to see the play area be well defined with edges rather than just floating invisibly out in space. The graphics feel very generic... no flourish, no pow, the sounds are lame, the music is pretty lame... like really, this is a very average-to-mediocre game from top to bottom. I already knew what to expect as soon as I heard that janky menu music, and I was spot on.","Jul 5, 2019 at 9:58 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:44.852565,Huddy60,Marvellous SHMUP,"This one really took me be surprised and I can't stop playing it.
A must have if you love old style (and even new style) shoot-em-ups and you even get a generous 1st world for free!

2022-05-28 19:28:44.867525,innovacy,Arcade for VR ... and faaaaast,"This is made like the old arcade games, just truely for VR. It gives you a feeling of a really fastpaced game constantly challenging you. The game has been very enjoyable to play. I would like to see a bit more explanations about some things in the game. Easy, normal and hard mode make it suitable for everyone. As I wanted to just enjoy the game and less challenge, the easy was perfect for me for now, having immediate great results yet not feeling it as supereasy. Normal mode was definetely more challenging. As such, the hard mode surely provides a much greater challenge for those who want to absolutely master things. Perfect for everyone! Unfortunately for me, it's missing yet some element (not sure which) to pay for the full game... (maybe seeing what would come next or having some more levels?) However, I like to see that such games are developed, and also games by indie developers! I may buy it actually, just to provide support ;)","May 16, 2019 at 2:18 AM",5, 2,"Hello Innovacy. Thank you very much for this detailed review that warms my heart :). About the full game, it includes the five worlds, they are different and quite long (especially the 4 & 5 ones), there will be updates but not for new worlds because I won't have enough time as I'm trying to make another arcade game. About what does what, there is an ""explanations"" page in the option menu, maybe I should make this page more visible. And I should find a way to give tips & tricks to make big scores (for example, it is possible to make 3+ millions in the first world in normal mode). I will ask my beta tester to make a video (or myself!). Even if you did not buy the full game, you review is really appreciated as a support, you just made my day brighter :D. Merci beaucoup."
2022-05-28 19:28:44.883482,stephen.mcimmie,ZX 80,"5 mins in game purchased it im old and this game is my style lol arcade at its best. nice to travel back somtimes still need to work out my controlers only 2 days into VR. not that graphics are wonderfull but its what it is meant to be .
thank you this game alone will make it worth my oculus rift S. 5 star for presenting a game as it is supposed to be
keep going ill look forward and hope you make another app","May 26, 2019 at 1:06 AM",5, 1,"Hi Stephen, thank you very much for the review. I'm really happy Anceder makes you enjoy your Rift. I get the ""ZX80"" reference of your title, which had a Z80 processor, like my Amstrad CPC :D. And, by the way, you never get old in a shoot'em up ;)"
2022-05-28 19:28:44.899439,Questmbl,,"Love the "" in the day"" style arcade shooter in VR. Try it for free, It will  be a definite purchase for arcade vertical retro shooter fans such as myself. VR is top notch. Great thumping tecno sound track!","May 8, 2019 at 5:28 AM",5, 5,"Thank you for the review. I'm really happy that you enjoy the game and the musics :D ! (People rarely talk about the sound) As a fan of vertical retro shooters myself, I'm glad other fans like Anceder :)"
2022-05-28 19:28:48.004135,excalibur2019,brilliant,"if your into 1970,s retro arcade games then this is a must. liked it so much i brought the paid version.  well done to the developers","Jun 1, 2019 at 5:16 AM",5, 3,Thank you Excalibur :D.
2022-05-28 19:28:48.020093,SKWERT,Fun basic game,This is like the old Atari game Asteroids on steroids for VR.  Fun little game when you get the hang of it.  Worth the few bucks.  Basic graphics and nothing fancy but a relaxing old school feel game.,"May 3, 2019 at 1:19 AM",5, 5,"Thank you for the review Skwert, I'm happy you had fun :D"
2022-05-28 19:28:48.036050,VinnyGunnz,,"It definitely gives you that old arcade style experience which is something I am looking for.  I think smaller, more detailed models and better animations and effects would have really elevated the experience, but maybe in keeping with the retro theme the game's appearance was intentional.  I like that I was able to play it for free as a kind of demo.  They should have an option to puchase the full game, as opposed to microtransactions which I'm opposed to.  So I will pass for now.","May 10, 2019 at 12:15 AM",3, 1,"Hi VinnyGunnz, thank you for the review :).
Yes, there is an option to buy the full game at once (via the shopping cart on the home screen). I hope maybe it will change your mind :D"
