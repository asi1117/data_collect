EDIT: With the answer of the developer i finally could launch the game (note that you should move in front of the menu, look at it and then left click with mouse) Without an xbox controller, i had to use the keyboard which is really annoying when in vr because you can't see the keyboard... i quickly was discouraged because on top of that i experienced motion sickness...

Will give it another try if controls for oculus touch are implemented one day and we can simply grab the things and interact easily as intended in a vr game","Aug 19, 2018 at 4:51 AM",1, 3,"Press the back button on the controller or ""r"" on the keyboard to reset view.
Also use the xbox pad. Or wsad key."
2022-05-28 19:39:29.523426,AirwolfPL,Low quality,This thing screams low quality from every virtual pixel. Keyboard/mouse and Xbox  controller support only. Unintuitive controls. Waste of time.,"Dec 29, 2017 at 11:36 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:29.539383,cybernettr,Half-finished game,"The footsteps are way TOO LOUD. As others have noted, there is little feedback as to which buttons are going to be pressed. The voice narration is good for a synthesized voice. The plane would have been a good place to give some narrated backstory. I couldn't make it past the snowy scene. Most people are going to lose interest (like me) if it is too hard to progress thru the game.","Oct 16, 2017 at 12:00 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:29.555340,BuckleyB,Flawed,Instructions weren't initially clear on how to control the game. Looking at objects to interact with them seems to be a very small window. After running around the first story for about 15 minutes trying to find the password I had to stop playing because the low framerate/jerkiness was causing motion sickness.,"Sep 21, 2017 at 12:38 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:29.571297,neuro27,Barebones Adventure,"Overall, the game has a lot of flaws and quite rough around the edges, but I can't fault it too much because it's simply an indie passion project released for free. What follows is some honest feedback. Firstly, it's difficult to start the game as the start button does not light up when you look at it, so it can be confusing. I used the xbox controller, but the intro tutorial indicated that you could use the keyboard as well. I rushed through the tutorial (which was missing some important controls as I'll get to later), which led to sound clips overlapping. Heads up - if you start a new sound clip, please have the old one end. After you get to the teleporter to start episode 0, you are transported to a low poly environment on the inside of a plane. There is no story, narrative, or sound. After some time, your plane inexplicably crashes into the mountains. You're free to walk around (slowly) at this point, listening only to the wind and the (annoying) crunching of your feet in the snow. There is no indication where to go, but eventually I found myself entering a base with a code input machine. The code was ""148"" as the previous reviewer kindly pointed out. This opens the iron gate into the mountain. After you enter, you find yourself descending stairs into darkness with only a headlamp to guide the way. At this point, you can walk faster using the left trigger and turn 90 degrees by using the bumpers. Otherwise, movement is only through traditional FPS dual thumbstick control. At the bottom of the stairs you find a black and green console with a battery hidden behind it. Grab the battery and bring it over to the battery slot on the opposite side of the hallway as the ""enter"" button. This allows you to progress, learning a little bit of story by listening to the ""Data Recorded."" Continue to find a badge on the floor for Mike Reel and 125 on the back. This translates to LCDG for the code in the locker room. The ending nicely tied up the few story elements present.","Jun 13, 2017 at 7:07 AM",2, 4,"Thanks for your helpful tips.
I'll keep in mind in the next release."
