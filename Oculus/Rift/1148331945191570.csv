2022-05-28 15:43:50.879490,BreadCannon,,"Bought during a sale, using free credit from Oculus. Absolutely would not suggest spending money on this, as someone else said, you have to pay to unlock parts of the game. It's a f***ing mini-game game. Why the hell would anyone want to pay multiple times to play virtual arcade games. Even though you can unlock certain parts with in game tickets, it takes way too long to get enough tickets, i.e, they designed it in such a way to push you to pay to unlock even those. So glad I didn't actually pay anything for this.","Oct 1, 2018 at 3:18 AM",1, 14,

Package the whole game, and set a price. Don't sell 'Half-3/4 of the game' an then ask me for more money for the rest? 1 star, I don't like being taken for a mug.

I was about to uninstall the game until I changed the graphics processor to the High-Preformance NVIDIA Processor (may be different for your computer I'm not an expert).

2022-05-28 15:43:54.091436,HisRoyalMajestyM,DLC NEVER ON SALE!!!,"On Steam the DLC is regularly on sale for $1.99. Somehow Oculus Home never does though! 
Game is a cluster of boring minigames, with controls that are not very good. You aim with your palm sort of, or underhand when selecting menus which is bizzare!!","Feb 10, 2019 at 11:40 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 15:43:54.106396,HiThere_,A day at the fair,"You start off with two short mini-games, and by playing you can unlock ten more games for FREE. You can also BUY another 6 mini-games from INSIDE the game (not directly from the Oculus Store) for an extra 8.00. Unfortunately the teleport angle that is only designed for an HTC Vive wand is WAY OFF on Touch (like 90° off, so you have to point your hand up to the sky to teleport forward ???), and even worse instead of grabing and throwing things with the Touch's grab button, you can only pinch and flick things with the Touch's trigger button (still playable, but it feels weird and this is a very big immersion killer). I wish they would fix these two basic controller problems (and maybe allow to buy the DLC directly from the Oculus Store, so people who stopped playing can notice it's existence), but even after releasing the DLC they still haven't fixed the controller problems, so only 3-stars for this lazy HTC Vive port because of it's annoyingly bad Touch controller support.","Jun 27, 2018 at 2:23 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:43:54.121356,andy2737,Could be great - ruined by locked levels,"For those who have played Pierhead, do not expect the same freedom.

This game has the potential to be just as enjoyable, but unfortunately restricts players to completing the same ""tutorial"" style mini games over and over again as they must complete same stages upon every game restart and complete each one in turn and purchase required rewards before they are able to move on to the next game. 

If this game were free or early access - fair enough. For an RRP of £15 however, I would like a game playable on my terms, not blocked off. 

Really disappointed as I feel I could really enjoy this game as the actual mini games themselves are great and the graphics are fun and well done. Do not understand the need for permanent blocking of games and progress. 

Paid 3.99 in sale for this, and still feel it was to much. If all aspects of the ""carnival"" were fully playable, I would be lauding it as a great buy at £15 RRP. Perplexing move by developers to cut themselves so short.

Please guys - update and sort this out - allow players the freedom to play the games they like!!!","Mar 31, 2018 at 5:20 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 15:43:57.198127,Erroll,Fun game but much content behind IAP.,"The kids enjoy the mini games much as they enjoy Carnival Games on the Wii. Its not deep but it is easy to get into. However, much of the content is locked behind an IAP paywall. This was not a free or even cheap game, it should not have this kind of phone game IAP model. Spend your money elsewhere.","Jan 16, 2018 at 8:29 AM",3, 3,

For the Carnival Games VR, it does not require internet connectivity. For the DLC Alley Adventure, it REQUIRES internet connectivity. Once you purchase the DLC, you must be connected to the internet in order to access those areas. In an email from 2K support, they are unable to fix/change this DLC for offline access.

The DLC itself only contains 1-2 games worth playing. They are both in the same area Cosmic Corner, putting green and the gravity gun game. I do not recommend this DLC for purchase.","Dec 15, 2017 at 1:00 PM",1, 7,

However, what is annoying is that at every moment during gameplay the save file fails. Loosing whatever progress you make sucks, and after looking online there is no clear resolution to this. I wouldn't reccommend this game, by some of the other carnival games which actually saves your progress.","Oct 8, 2017 at 6:17 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 15:44:03.511242,7unnix,Great fun for familes / groups!,"This is a great little intro to the world of VR, certainly for the younger players or with a group of friends round. Clearly, it's not boasting stunning visuals but there is enough variety in the games for many hours of fun and the global / friends scoreboard is great if you have friends with VR too. Would be cool to see a new game or two added in future at some point? Worth buying - Certainly, although maybe not at its full price. If you can get it for £15.00 or under in a sale, you won't be disappointed.","Sep 13, 2017 at 6:44 AM",5, 0,

They seem to go out of sync frequently, and slows down your pace and accuracy when playing some of the games.  Work out those kinks and this game can be much better!","Sep 5, 2017 at 9:15 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:44:03.541161,JochenScheisse,Not sure if it's a bug...,"... but the controlls are horrible!! Pressing both thumbstick buttons in order to adjust the view? Ok. But everytime the view is adjusted the height gets changed for some reason. Grabbing objects is handled with the rear trigger button. Selecting a place to go sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Sometimes you just end up with something in your hand.

2022-05-28 15:44:03.556121,FastLawyer,No crashes here,"I just bought the game on sale for $5 and the game started up fine and there were no crashes or any problems with tracking, the touch controllers worked fine even with 2 sensors and a small space (standing room only).  The 3 mini-games I played were fine for this type of game.  However, the game developer made a bad decision in locking games.  You can only play 2 at the start and you have to earn enough tickets to then play a 3rd game and so forth.  It's a really bad implementation of unlocks.  There are leaderboards and there are better ""carnival"", ""arcade"" VR mini-games, but this one is probably runs the smoothest without any tracking problems.  Considering the sale price I recommend, but mileage may vary.  Think kids would like this version of mini-games more than adults since they are simple to play (less frustration).","Aug 10, 2017 at 3:00 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 15:44:09.868239,JCat,Surprisingly Good!,"Picked this up during the Summer Sale. I had my eye on this as these types of fairground mini-games lend themselves well to VR, as long as the physics are good. You start off with a few games of chance, but have to unlock the other areas and games by using winning tickets to purchase themed toys (which are keys to the unlockables).


 Some games are simply no fun at all (the hit the target to dunk the person in the tank comes to mind), while others, like the Rock climbing, Ring Toss, skee ball and horse raising are fun! My personal favorite is the Haunted House shooting gallery, though the premise is super basic. It's like riding through a real carnival ride (I wish all the rides were rideable). If only it ramped up in difficulty!  

There's tons of toys to win and collect with tickets, and the controls are straightforward, which works out great for non-VR visitors.  The master of ceremonies comments quickly become repetitive, but you can turn this annoyance off in options. With the incentive to win tickets,  Carnival Games retains more interest than the visually cool,  but worth only one visit Nivida tech demo.","Jun 24, 2017 at 8:33 AM",4, 1,
