Now they finally put it on Quest, big disappointment, when they want you to pay for a dummied down version of their game. Something I already own on Oculus Service. Was there more added? Or same game?  I’m assuming it’s the exact same, and should already be in my library. Greed strikes again. Not worth getting charged twice for a walking simulator.",Sep 10 at 6:16 AM,3, 7,

2022-05-28 14:23:30.004236,Divissimo,Not everyone could play it,"I put 5 stars to encourage developers to make more VR horror games in this atmosphere.  And because I don't understand some bad reviews.

Especially the ones saying that the controls are terrible, or we walk too slow.

Im not especially struggling on the quest 2, and the walk speed is fine to enjoy the game for what is it, like most of horror games are doing it.

What is the point to be able to sprint like crazy in that kind of game? would break any possible immersion.

Anyways, Im used to play a lot of scary games like outlast, visage, phasmophobia and I was looking for something new in VR. 
But I hesitated seeing the reviews that did not seem totally unanimous.

Finally I took it on an impulse, and what I can say after a little hour it's that the game is quite scary. This is a nice horror experience in vr for sure. 

I would recommend it to people looking for scary stuff in VR. There are no many right now but this one worth it","Feb 5, 2021 at 2:46 PM",5, 32,
2022-05-28 14:23:33.125032,Still-Chill,"good story, excessive jumpscares are bad","The Story and athmosphere are very creepy and cool, but the jumpscares happen so often that they arent scary anymore.

2022-05-28 14:23:33.140990,niki1609,Controls,"The controls on the VR version are absolutly atrocious! I bought this game because it was for VR. I could only play a few minutes before I had to stop. I had to fight with doors, not just because they open and close on their own, but because the slightest touch slams them closed after you've tried 10 times to open the door only to see that one small thing has changed which you HAVE to do in order to progress. I'll play more of the game later when I have more patience, until then, this is the best review I can leave.","Nov 18, 2019 at 10:32 AM",2, 33,

Perhaps the difficulty is set too high for me, haha. Anywho, I get to where you like push a start button, and my controller doesn’t register anything with said button. I’m assuming it’s the last thing on the setup part before the game starts, lol oh well. My laptop is new and beefy, so I’m pretty certain it’s not that. Any thoughts?

2022-05-28 14:23:33.169912,beastmckenney17,"Very Creepy, Worth $10-$15","I got this game while it was on sale and had no issues with it. The graphics, sound, and interactive components felt great and I was constantly in suspense. The movement in the game also can be turned to free movement and the ability to smoothly turn as opposed to 90 degree turns. The game doesn't bail out of cheap jump scares and truly was awesome to play. All these other bad reviews just sound like their system was not built to handle the game. In the end, if you're looking for a fun and scary VR horror game with excellent visuals go with this!","Jul 12, 2019 at 3:19 AM",4, 35,
2022-05-28 14:23:33.184872,morningland,Please Avoid at all Costs,"Please... PLEASE do not purchase this game for 30$ if at all.  It should be 10$ at most. 
I'd read about all the issues with this game before buying but I was excited to try it because it looks scary. So trust me, this response is genuine because I wanted ot love this game but I could not anticipate how immersion breaking and unfun it  would be to play and control
You are dropped into the world with no direction of where to go or what to do.  This would be great if the game didn't play so awfully. Walking is PAINFULLY slow. Why the developers decided to set the walk to a slow crawl I will never know. My only guess is that it was some way to extend the playtime.  There is a way to briskly walk but you have to hold the joystick button at ALL TIMES and after awhile your thumb will get pretty sore.  A simple toggle run off and on button would have been a smart addition to the game. 
There is also some strange screen tearing that happens CONSTANTLY while playing the game which is immersion breaking but not even the biggest problem. 
There may be moments in the game where you simply can't pick up items to progress the game at all. I am in the last room of the game and there is a tape I need to pick up but after 20-30 minutes of trying I finally gave up in frusteration and watched the end on youtube.  
Please do not waste your time or money on this game, there are so many other VR titles that are actually designed well.  The game is scary but by the end and not even being able to finish it I can say that I now hate this game and wished I could return it. 
Don't make my same mistake, DO NOT PURCHASE this for anything over 10$ or 15$ MAX! If you do buy it and are annoyed please return it within your two hour window.","Jul 5, 2019 at 9:45 PM",1, 42,

2022-05-28 14:23:36.363497,titan_rw,Clunky controls and crazy boring.,"This is the first review I've written.  It's the first time I've been compelled to write a review based on how bad the experience is.  I bought this on sale quite a few months ago and never got around to playing it until now.  So unfortunately I'm way past the point that I'd be able to get a refund.  My fault on that.   I'll be sure to try games right away from now on.  

The controls are horrible.  I've played dozens of games with the touch controllers, and none of them feel this wrong.  The button are all wrong.  Even after an hour of playing I still end up using the wrong button every time I want to do something.  This is not configurable that I'm aware of.   Picking something up can take 30 seconds or so to get it just right, with 10-20 tries on the grip button.  No other game is this bad in this regard.  I literally dred having to interact with the environment because I know it's going to take forever.

And scarry game?  It's dead boring.  Nothing in 1+ hour of play actually scared me.  I don't understand how this is rated so good.  It's just a plain bore to play.  Moving around the house so slow while some random things happen, probably when you're not even looking.  Scary events need to be triggered off of where you're looking primarily, not where you are.  Everything that's supposed to be scary just seems 'weird', not in the slightest scary.  Even if you ignore the lack of scary-ness, there's no real tension either.  It just feels boring.

So that's my review.  Not scary, no tension, just boring with tedious controls.  I would have refunded if it was still an option.  Lession learned in trying out games as soon as you buy them I guess.","Dec 11, 2018 at 9:38 AM",1, 13,"wow, sorry you had such a poor experience with our game. a few questions if you dont mind answering? what do you mean it took 30 seconds to pick something up? that's a new comment for us. would you mind sharing your PC specs? also, were you wearing headphones? You obviously feel very strongly about your review and experience and it would be very helpful to us, if we can explore further. could be that you are just numb to scary stuff (Like me personally), but would appreciate hearing more. Regardless, thanks for the support."
2022-05-28 14:23:36.378456,FastLawyer,Happy Halloween!,"This is a really well done horror experience. The story is actually really good. The only thing holding the game back from 5 stars it the clunky controls. It's not always obvious where to go next, but the light puzzles are pretty easy and logical. Scary, perfect for playing on a late night alone in Halloween (like tonight).","Nov 1, 2018 at 9:12 AM",4, 8,

There's just a bug I wanted the devs to consider fixing in the upcoming update if possible. While I physically crouch and snap-turn, my body is floating until I snap-turn again. I know there's a crouch button but it's just much better crouching for real :P","Apr 13, 2018 at 3:51 AM",5, 3,"first off, thanks for the support.

2022-05-28 14:23:42.692740,AtlasP,,"5 star overall experience + excellent graphics, minus one star for the absolutely terrible Touch implementation (button mappings/inventory management/etc). If you're a decent gamer who likes to play horror games then it's not insurmountable and ultimately I would still recommend it as the best horror game on the store. But unfortunately the controls make it completely inaccessible as a VR party experience for casuals--they just spend most of their time fiddling with the controls/pressing the wrong buttons and getting frustrated (while the audience quickly becomes just as frustrated watching them). Considering the simplicity of the gameplay there is no reason the controls couldn't be much more intuitive, and it would only take a decent designer a week to fix--but by this point I wouldn't expect it.","Jan 28, 2018 at 5:48 PM",4, 26,
2022-05-28 14:23:42.708698,metafish69,The go-to horror game currently on VR!,"This is by far the best horror game out currently for VR. The atmosphere is mint. The graphics could use an option for those of us with more powerful rigs to adjust at the very least the resolution, but the immersion still holds up strong.

The only downside is that when smooth turning is on there is a stutter and a flash every time you turn with the joystick. This break in immersion is pretty much game-breaking unfortunately. I may get a refund and wait for a little while to buy it again. If you're using a controller while seated this might be different, or if you're using roomscale where you don't have to turn with the joystick as much that might be tolerable as well.

Fair warning for those considering buying the current version.

Dev's if you're reading this and want my specs let me know :)","Mar 26, 2018 at 1:10 PM",3, 3,"thanks for the support. that flash you are referring to is reentering your camera when you turn. are you standing or sitting? if sitting, it may not be as bad. you should also have the option of free movement if you turn on stafe. the flash should only be happening when you use snap turn. regardless, Its an unreal engine bug that we have been trying to fix. hopefully we'll get it fixed soon. thanks again."

2022-05-28 14:23:45.851869,O-Keihart,Review in progress....but movement...,"Havent finished the game yet, but the movement really is a problem.
The problem is that diagonals are not an option when moving with the stick,  presing diagonal locks you forward or sideways making you feel like stucked on geometry. So you have 3 options to make it work.

You either learn to phisically turn when moving forward to make adjustments, disable strafing or both.

The movement system is way more complicated than it needs to be, it really makes playing the game a struggle with the controls.

Simple solution, conceptually at least because i know there is nothing easy in going back to finished software and making changes, copy the movement system of Onward but make it slower. Ill try to finish it, because i already bough it and some parts are very interesting, lots of PT inspiration it seems, but the controls really take away a big chunck of the enjoyment and i usually am up for complicated control schemes if they work better than the status quo, but this is not the case here.","Dec 20, 2017 at 4:14 AM",3, 7,"First off, thanks for the support. we continue to improve our game and controls,  and update will be coming soon which will offer you free movement.

You can't move forward or back while straffing (and vice versa). I prefer smooth turning but it's too slow (even at x3 turning speed) and the screen flickers to black everytime you turn. It just seems like a chore to play. :( After about 45 minutes of clumsy gameplay and several game crashes, I just can't recommend this game (not sure how they can get away with charging for games like these!).","Nov 26, 2017 at 10:01 AM",1, 11,

If you are having this issue follow the developers response: [Original Post: I'm really struggling to move in this game and I've just figured out why.  Your character turns whichever way your head direction is and therefore you can't move forward and look around without constantly correcting for the unintentional turn.  The direction should be based on your hand controller direction (i.e. your body position) rather than your head as you would in real life.]

2022-05-28 14:23:52.217553,livevicarious,Horror (almost) perfected!,"This game provides a great balance of jump scares and puzzle solving. The controls are a bit awkward and the game does require you to rotate in place in order to move through the spaces. However this is a good thing as it builds that tension knowing you have to actually turn around to see what may be behind you. The first run through will give you hours of fun, once you know the game however you could easily run through in about 20 minutes which lowers the replay value significantly. Where this game shines though is it's ability to build and maintain atmosphere and tension, along with some insanely polished environments and details. I would like to see the hands and inventory system get a few tweaks though. I think games like these need to have your hands vanish when you grab onto drawers or doors as seeing your hand go way in front of you out of place ruins the immersion. This still in my opinion though is a must buy if you love horror!","Oct 27, 2017 at 8:35 PM",4, 4,"Thanks for the support! and grateful for the comments. we love suggestions, it truly helps us rethink certain mechanics."
2022-05-28 14:23:55.317900,Veraxus,"Excellent VR horror, but lacks polish","This is one of the two best horror games avaialable in VR - on par with Wilson's Heart. Great mood and atmosphere, very believable environments, and it does a good job with both that sense of underlying dread and the occassional jump scare. And while Oculus Home lists the game as ""intense"", I found the VR support to be very comfortable, even with strafing enabled. Where the game falls short is on polish... especially where interacting with the environment is concerned.

Wilson's Heart set the gold standard for interacting in VR... your hands lock to objects to you KNOW you are interacting, but go ghostly when your hands move out of bounds. It makes obscure interactions so much easier to intuitively understand, and Paranormal Activity DESPERATELY needs that. The problem here is that you can't always tell what is interactive or whether you're just failing to interact with something that is SUPPOSED to be interactive; that makes it very easy to miss important things. By adding some of the polished interactivity cues that Wilson's Heart pioneered, this could easily be a 5 star game.","Sep 24, 2017 at 1:18 AM",3, 14,

I laugh at all the reviews that say Resident Evil is scary, or The Affected: The Manor. Those are laughable. I was about to give up on anything horror in VR or anywhere. Then I decided to buy Paranormal Activity. It is SCARY! Its not jump scares or anything that is scary- It is the psychological scare that you do not know what is about to happen. I LOVE this game. Is it hard game play? Not at all. Its more of an exploration game but again, the fear factor is INTENSE.

It's 3 hours if you don't count how many times you have to look for youtube videos and forum the get unstuck. Worst, when I returned to the game halfway from a saved game, half of my inventory was gone and I had to start triggering events again. So saved games are not working properly. This just proves that there is no quality control on the oculus store. This game is old and nothing has been solved since it's release. It's a scary game, the graphics are nice, but the experience is spoiled by technical problems. The goal of the game is to trigger things that you cannot see nor know. So it's just random walking until something trigger.","Aug 27, 2017 at 12:41 PM",2, 13,

2022-05-28 14:23:58.556816,berickphilip,BORING AF,"EXTREMELY disappointing. Boring. NOT scary (reviews saying this is scary must be from really easily scared people). I am serious this is NOT horror. It is a walking simulator with awkward interactions, inside some house. Yes I did play a lot, I got to some of the ""scary places"". Come on, this is really stupid. I want some Silent-hill-scary, or some Siren-scary, or some Fatal-frame-scary level horror game. In here, I was walking around BEGGING for something interesting to happen. To make things worse it got on sale right after I wasted my money. But that would actually be ok if the game was ANY good.","Aug 17, 2017 at 11:08 PM",1, 5,"sorry you were disappointed. we designed a major portion of the game to be randomized scares. which means any scares outside of the story scares will be random. there is a chance that you will not see scares that others do. it means there is a chance that not much in haunting terms will happen, and then you play again and a lot more happens. its random. there are ups and downs to the watcher system. but we wanted the experience to be somewhat different each time you played and it also makes sure, you don't know whats going to happen which can be a lot scarier. Like a real haunted house, you never know if a haunting is going to happen but when it does, its scary. thanks for the support though."
2022-05-28 14:23:58.572773,Plaguesville,Very Unnerving Horror Experience.,"The impact of being made in the Unreal engine really comes across in the polish that you can see and almost feel when you’re inside the VR headset as the graphics are amazing and immerse you in the game. It is realistic looking enough for it to be very unnerving when you walk the hallways and lurk around the corners. With that said, there are some graphical problems holding it back a little, such as flat pieces of paper with no physics built in so they appear to be made out of clay. Also, some of the lighting on the textures doesn’t look right within the context of the room at times, and the lights that are turned on within the rooms of the game don't light the room properly. However, these are small nitpicks from an otherwise amazing looking game and will by no means takes you out of the experience. 

How strong are your nerves? Are they made out of steel or flabby tissue? Either way, you will not be able to rest easy in this game when it comes to the sound design; from the creepy high pitched voices of children to the uneasy music you hear coming from the next room. The sound is one of my favorite aspects of this game. When you pick up a piece of paper to read and suddenly, the door next to you closes and you hear foot steps running right outside, which makes you very aware that the only thing saving you is the door that is shut. Your nerves go into high gear and you don't want to open the door because of the sounds you hear coming from another area. 

This game is probably the creepiest and most uneasy nerve wracking experience I have ever had in a video game. I dread moving forward, I get very uneasy looking around corners, I don't want to open doors, and there is no way I am setting foot in that room! 

If you aren't a wimpy wimp and want to have one of the best horror experiences currently available in VR gaming, buy this game.","Jul 7, 2017 at 7:39 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:24:01.664618,cybernettr,Lots of searching for stuff,"THE GOOD: Ambience and atmosphere are very good. For example, the ambient noises outside the house, such as the dog barking, are very good. I could almost smell the cool, crisp evening air. THE BAD: It's a puzzle game, even if the puzzles are mild, and I don't much care for puzzle games. For example, part of progressing is finding stuff such as keys. I hate searching for lost stuff in real life, so why should I enjoy it in games? I wish this and other games at least had a ""hint"" system that you could trigger if you get ""stuck"".","Aug 7, 2017 at 11:06 AM",3, 4,thanks for the support.
2022-05-28 14:24:01.680575,Arupian,Creepy (edited unfavorably),"I LOVE  the atmosphere in this game. It's genuinely creepy to hear a kids song playing beyond a locked door ! Excellent sound design. ""Bravo"" to the devs on that front. Unfortunately, just as I was really getting into it...CRASH. I'm on Nvidia drivers 384.76, SLI GTX1080 (SLI disabled). I'll play again to see if it crashes a second time. I hope not.

...Edit.... Running the lastest nVida drivers 384.94. Loaded the game at my save point, crashed before I took 2 steps. Shoddy work. The developers solution: keep uninstalling current drivers and installing drivers 5 versions ago JUST to play this game cos we can't figure out a workaround.

2022-05-28 14:24:01.714484,goreroad,"Scary, but also nausea inducing","Any adventure type game without a teleport or some comfort mode of moving is selling itself short. If you can handle the movement system and like scary games, then you will probably like this game. The graphics are nice and runs well on a 290.
 Game can be a bit frustrating at times. In VR when I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do to open a door, it irritates me. Can't play it very long because I start feeling dizzy.

In response to developers, the game runs solid on my system. My gripe is that a game where you constantly walk around is hampered for a large portion of players like myself who get VR sick from artificial motion. If this game had some kind of teleport and I could still utilize my roomscale, I would easily give it four stars. Forcing players who get VR sick to only use artificial motion is a bad decision. Even missing a couple jump scares is better than simply turning off the game because the player feels sick.","Aug 8, 2017 at 9:18 AM",3, 7,"First off, thanks for the support. Did you look in the options menu? we have several movement options for you. Our minimum spec is a GTX 980 card. I am guessing that your frame rate is below optimal and that may be the reason you are getting motion sickness. Our game runs at a consistent 90 frames when running on the min spec. Were you running any other software while playing that? that could be a potential performance buster.Again, thanks for the support its greatly appreciated."
