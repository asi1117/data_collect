2022-05-28 20:05:41.550911,teadrinker,Advanced and well made!,"Amazing design, animation, lighting and sound!
I did not feel super invested in the story.
Make sure you have a top machine to run this.

I saw this on Quest 2 using link cable, but I think it would be even better on Rift (or any OLED for better blacks) even if resolution might be lower.",Apr 20 at 9:10 AM,5, 0,

2022-05-28 20:05:41.598784,AVexed-PredaNerd,A Visual Masterpiece,"Gloomy eyes is an epic story of how love/friendship has no bounds. It's a third person pov giving you the capability to really look around the world presented to you and it's so creative and gorgeous you will find yourself watching each episode multiple times to see things from different angles, at least my daughter and I did.","Oct 20, 2020 at 4:24 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:05:41.615738,EddieNanakase,Better than I expected   !   !,"I was thinking I was going to be in the middle of a movie or something, but instead, I was watching everything from a third person perspective.  It was a shock from what I was expecting, but at the same time it blew my mind as what I was watching resembled that of a Nightmare Before Christmas or rather a Tim Burton style type of movie !  The voice acting is superb, a 12 out of a 10 point system !  It literally made me feel like I was watching a movie !  I have bought and downloaded a few movies in Oculus and don't get me wrong, some of them were really well made, but for me, Gloomy Eyes takes the cake !  This is definitely an experience that should be added to your library.  It might not be long, but then again, it's super rare to find a lengthy experience in VR.   Gloomy Eyes is worth buying at full price !  I highly recommend it !","Oct 30, 2020 at 11:39 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:05:44.740957,mgerard,,unbelievable experience!!! it really shows the power of VR and how it can transport you from one side to the other in any direction8 I love it!!!,"Oct 17, 2020 at 6:18 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 20:05:44.771875,Prophett,Enjoyable Experience,"This was a really well produced experience.  I loved the Tim Burtonesque style and the sets and animations were excellent.  On more than one occasion I found myself asking, ""Was this really done in Unity?""  I guess that that's both a testament to the talent of the team involved, and to how far Unity has come over the years.  Hat's off.

I did wish that I could increase the supersampling, but there are no visual settings that I could find.  That said, there were moments where I was getting a performance hit on a 1080TI, so perhaps the visual settings are hiddden for a reason.  I would still have liked the option though.

Length-wise, it's a bit short, but not disappointly so.  There are 3 chapters and each is maybe around 8-15 mins long.

The story is very compelling.  I didn't mean to watch the whole thing in one sitting, but ended up doing just that.

All in all, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it, especially if you're a fan of dark, Time Burton-esque fairy tales and VR animations.","Feb 22, 2020 at 11:14 PM",4, 32,
2022-05-28 20:05:44.786835,Mayonnaiseman,"Gorgeous, but with a huge issue","It doesn't look like this has happened to anyone else thus far in the comments section, but episode 3 for me has absolutely no volume. It's muted the entire time. The other 2 scenes work flawlessly.  Any ideas for a fix?
Definitely not system specs.  I did try uninstall-reinstalling.

The first 2 scenes are beautiful. Still rating 5 stars, but hopefully someone can offer a solution?","Mar 19, 2020 at 9:43 PM",5, 4,"Hi Mayonnaiseman! A new version of Gloomy Eyes is now live, with the audio fixed. Thank you!"
2022-05-28 20:05:44.802792,mark garroutte,Cute,"A little dark and small for my taste,nice storyline. Had trouble seeing most of it at my age,it's a fairy tale,music was good,tim burton kind of feel to it. I personally regret paying for it now. It was somewhat glitchy and laggy,my pc is up to just about any task","Aug 3, 2020 at 8:01 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:05:47.901615,dballot34,Beautiful world but...,"FYI this is not a game, but a story where you spin around In your chair as the story unfolds around you. 

The video has its flaws with weird clipping, almost looks like bats flying around your face in certain scenes, but most importantly chapter 3 has zero sound so I’ll have to wait until they patch it. 

Once the game is patched I’d give it a 5 because it’s a video you can show your friends and they would be blown away.","Mar 22, 2020 at 6:03 AM",4, 3,"Hi dballot34! A new version of Gloomy Eyes is now live, with the audio fixed. Thank you!"
2022-05-28 20:05:47.916575,Beanur,Stunning VR Animation,"This is without doubt, the most impressive thing I have seen in VR. I'd been waiting for it to be released commercially after seeing it at VIFF's Immersed festival. The quality of the animation and art direction is leaps and bounds beyond anything else I've seen in Virtual Reality and the creators deserve huge credit for pushing the envelope of immersive story-telling.","Mar 18, 2020 at 9:48 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:05:47.932533,ParadiseDecay,Best VR Animation of 2020 so far!,"1st Impressions Video with Commentary // Oculus Rift S // GTX 1060 (6GB):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8qoskCOjSw

My Initial Thoughts:
One of the best VR animation films of 2020! - Don't miss this and its a shame its not just a little bit cheaper!
ALSO, I did have no sound on Episode 3 so I might have to re-install the experience. I would be interested to hear if others have the same problem?

*PLEASE NOTE: You may see artifacts in the video, especially in the black levels, these are a result of me having to over-expose the footage as it was too dark to show any normal footage. These artifacts are NOT in the experience!","Feb 25, 2020 at 2:13 AM",4, 5,"Hi steeeeeeeeeee! A new version of Gloomy Eyes is now live, with the audio fixed. Thank you!"
2022-05-28 20:05:47.949488,lafarge7,Wow wow wow,"This is the most beautiful VR experience I have ever seen, the production is super, I wish I could buy the right and make it free so that everyone could see the potential of this VR technology. Kudos to the developers of this masterpiece, we need more of it.","Feb 26, 2020 at 3:58 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:05:47.965445,RuneSR2,New reference in animated story-telling!,"Maybe I'm getting too spoiled - too much VR content - so much content that I start to overlook the diamonds in the rough. And Gloomy Eyes is indeed a bright shining diamond. I think it's not just the best VR movie, but the best animated VR story experience ever. I connected more to this than Wolves in the Walls - and although Crow is awesome, Gloomy Eyes felt more like art, while Crow felt more like entertainment (for kids). The Great C was also nice - but Gloomy Eyes is so much more. 
Gloomy Eyes is fully 360 degrees  - not sure it'll work sitting, you have to turn around 360 degrees to follow the story. It's very dark - got SPUD (oled mura) most of the time, saw a VIVE logo at start-up - I think Gloomy Eyes was originally designed for oled (I bought the Oculus version as I wanted ASW 2.0 if needed). I tested Gloomy Eyes using my CV1 ss 2.0 (i7 7700K + GTX 1080), I have not tested it using the Index yet. Textures are as impressive as Moss, probably even better than Moss - and while the animation reminded me of Allumette, you've got (many) more frames per second. Colin Farrell made the voice-over and did an awesome job! 
The experience is like 34 minutes, and it's really worth $15 - I can't remember ever seeing quality like this. Can't remember any real animation movie having impressed me more. Gloomy Eyes is a 10/10 in my book - it's the Lone Echo of VR animated story telling. 
Knowing that the game wanted GTX 1080 just for standard ss, of course I went in using ss 2.0 (using Oculus Tray Tool since there are no settings inside the app) - but it really worked just fine - and looked awesome. Didn't notice asw 2.0, but it probably was there - but this isn't a fast-paced action game, asw 2.0 may be just perfectly hidden. 
Gloomy Eyes is a must-see - even though it's $15 the price is fully warranted and to me this app surely is a keeper. I'm going to show this movie to my sons and the wife - because I'm sure they've never - ever - seen as impressive as this experience!","Mar 16, 2020 at 6:29 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:05:51.043315,tjholowaychuk,This is VR storytelling,"Very Burton-like story and character/set design, this was a really nice experience and the way they direct you around the story visually is great. I would love to see more content like this.

For some reason I have no audio for the third episode though, maybe a bug? I see someone below has the same issue at least, so hopefully they'll patch it.","Mar 12, 2020 at 12:49 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:05:51.059272,juist,"Wow, please more","All I can say is, WOW, please make more like this. the graphics are great, the story is good and the whole experience is immersive. I would love to have more experiences like these in VR.","Mar 3, 2020 at 3:44 AM",5, 3,
