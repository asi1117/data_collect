Tried verifying files, rebooting, reinstalling, nothing was working until I followed these steps that apparently bypassed some known bug in the code for my intel processor:

Right click on ""My computer"" then properties

Then right hand side ""advanced system settings""

On the Advanced tab choose Environment Variables

In THE SECOND window click NEW

Enter name

OPENSSL_ia32cap

Enter value

Advantages over ""ToTF""
- Multiplayer
- Cool Enemy fighters 
- Not much else

Cons 
- Hands dont move as fast as your hands in real life
- punches dont connect 
- arcadey feel 
- wierd movement controlls
- Limited to the games stamina bar 
- Multiplayer doesnt even work when trying to play friends

In conclusion its not a bad game in itself, its just there is a superior version called Thrill of the fight which
- Lets you play until you personally cant move or youll vomit
- Normal movement
- Punches dont lag behind and they fell impactful and weighted
- Punches connect
- Your enemy takes advantage of you letting your gaurd down
- good adjustable settings

Defense doesn't work at all, you have a fake stamina meaning you can only punch as much as the game wants you to.  Ennemies in Champion difficulty drop you with 20 hits when you need to land more than 200 to even hope to defeat them, well, not all of them, the last tier is tough the rest just drop like flies even in Champion.

2022-05-28 13:14:44.263125,PlutoCrashed,"An excellent game, except for stamina","This game is one of the best VR games I've ever played. Everytime I get into the game I always have fun. But, at the same time, the game has a stamina system. This system limits the amount of punches you can throw before having to hunker down for 2-4 seconds. It is honestly one of the dumbest mechanics I have found in a VR game. This game is a boxing game, yet limits the amount of punches you can throw. WHY? The game wouldn't need to be changed at all if you removed the mechanic, that's how little it matters. All it does is slow down fights and get you knocked out in others if you're going for a knockout and suddenly it's like your slapping the person with a tissue. 

TLDR: This game would be 5 stars if they didn't put a pointless stamina system in the game the slows down fights and limits the player's own ability. If you want a game that is just as fun with much more realism, play Thrill of The Fight (which is also cheaper).","Jul 3, 2020 at 6:06 AM",2, 52,

Cons: However, it's like the developers felt they sould just submit their half finished homework. There's a side story with one chapter that never goes anywhere. The career plot is fun, but fighting is pretty easy even in intermediate mode (and I am no pro boxer!). And then the game is over before you know it. If you want to have some fun, you can sit in the ring waiting for someone to challenge you PvP. I still haven't gotten anyone to actually join me in a fight.

2022-05-28 13:14:53.765064,winterwolf85,Great starter-boxing game.,"I enjoyed this game alot. Visually it is great. The training mode really is challenging. However the game it self, is really just some arcade game, that doesn't really take your own skills in to consideration. Your stamina, strenght, etc. is determened by the boxer you chose. So even if you could go on for hours, your boxer is fatigued. Or even if you are weak, your boxer hits heavy etc.

The fights are over very quickly and the story mode is very short. Also it is disapointing, that you can't create your own fighter (sure, you follow the rocky story... but still).

There are other, more realistic boxing games out there. I switched to another game, which is more like a simulation than a game.","Nov 18, 2019 at 8:57 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 13:14:53.781021,SilentHashassin7,For Those Complaining About Movement...,"Before I talk about owning this on the PSVR before repurchasing on the Quest/Riff I’m gonna explain something.

There’s a very simple method is not only for easy mobility but it will also increase your fighting capabilities in PVP. First TURN ADVANCE LOCOMOTION OFF!!! Its unnecessary. Now the game explains to swing your arms but there’s an easier way, if you hold both of the move buttons down with the gloves to your face soon as you move your hands or sway, your whole body will follow. If you hold the buttons down and kinda may a Skii motion forward or backwards you will shoot in that direction depending on how hard you swing. If you toy around with this you will learn even more advance tricks, like shooting directly behind your opponent, press the B button and automatically face them, most people can’t react fast enough or don’t know how to automatically face their opponent, so you can get some great shots in. Works very well in SinglePlayer making you feel like DBZ seeing them in slow motion while you’re just planning which angle you should launch your next attack. 

Now of course the stamina thing can be an issue but you won’t ever fall into that situation if you just pick your shots, also I think they included this mechanics because certain fighter have stat buffs in certain punches, so to spam shots could be kinda cheating, would be nice if they had a mode where all the boxers are at an even level.

With that being said I am looking forward to Survios next project, these fighting mechanics is what I wanted from a boxer. I played Thrill of The Fight but I think VRFighting Champions has better mechanics than that game but Creed has much better mechanics than both previous mentioned games imo. 5/5","Mar 12, 2020 at 11:55 AM",5, 4,

I have repeately done 3 or 4 punch combos which would knock a real persons head off and the bot acts like I hit them with a feather duster.

2022-05-28 13:14:56.977647,SamuelAB,Lots of potential,"One of my biggest complaint is that the ""drill"" easily start distributing exercises outside of the room boundary. This means you end up losing exercises because it puts a punching bag inside the walls of your house, which obviously you can't reach.

A bit more effort could be put to avoid placing the user in exercise directions that the game knows will be problematic. Favor placing the player in front of two cameras so that his/her hands won't be obstructed by the body. In drill exercise mode, you can place the exercise anywhere, so favor a direction with better tracking.

The story mode is great, but too short. I hope it gets developped a lot more. Would love to see 30+ unique characters.

To people who are complaining about the stamina system: you are punching in the air without hitting anyone. I find this mechanic works, seems like people would appreciate the option to turn it off either way.

For a fuller experience, learn a thing or two from Knockout League, their punching bag exercise is really fun and they have a great character building aspect, even if more cartoonish.

Maybe a type of stamina mixed drill that does not stop would be a good adition.

Overall this game is a great accomplishment, with a few acute flaws.","Sep 24, 2019 at 7:58 AM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 13:15:00.141348,Spedizzo,Great for fun and for working out,"I would have given this game a higher star rating if it weren't for the stamina system. When your fighter is low on stamina, they either cannot throw punches or the punches are extremely slow.

It kind of ruins the immersion because you are more focused on your gloves flashing more than defending your opponent at times. If your opponent blocks one of your punches, you all of the sudden have no stamina. That is kind of ridiculous.

I think the devs should really evaluate the stamina situation, especially when it comes to PVP. Maybe make the stamina more costly in later rounds... or make body shots reduce the opponent's stamina... anything but the way it is now.

Aside from those issues, the game offers plenty of content. When I don't feel like going to the gym in real life, I will throw Creed on and try to get some high scores in the gym, or take on the AI in some 1 v 1 fights. PVP can be really fun too if both players have a good connection.

Overall, this game is definitely worth it.","Jun 29, 2019 at 12:59 PM",3, 23,

2022-05-28 13:15:03.282068,adam.poole.313,Very poor design decisions,"The look and feel are just about perfect but they made some silly design choices that just ruin the experience. When you get stunned you go out of body and have to match your real hands to your VR hands. When you get knocked out you go way out of your body and have to run back to it. It is the dumbest thing I have ever seen and kills all immersion. The simulated fatigue by making your punches useless if you punch too much just doesn't work and despite all the people complaining about it the developers stand behind it. The biggest weakness of the game is that it seems to only register a punch as hard or soft, regardless of how hard or soft you actually threw it. The result is very little incentive to actually try to throw a hard punch... as long as its just hard enough to qualify as a power punch. Even worse is that you frequently receive accidental knockouts when you barely touched them. More than once I have accidentally knocked someone out while trying to just adjust my headset. Ultimately my biggest complaint about the game is that is penalizes you for trying to play realistically and that just defeats the point. Thrill of the Fight is infinitely better in every regard it just lacks the look and polish that you get from a major studio production. As a die hard boxing fan it is a no brainer for me, there is no reason to play this over Thrill of the Fight.","Jul 19, 2019 at 10:26 AM",2, 31,

I was tempted too do so myself. Other people have eluded to the length of the career mode and I was shocked when my final fight happened. I thought, nah seriously that can't be it and waited to carry on, but that was it. Could have been so much more! The devs have done all the hard stuff and made this a brilliant piece of work. The easy bit is surely just to make it a bit longer and build the story a bit better. Very frustrating. Could easly have got 6 stars from me if that was possible :) but can only give it 4.

2022-05-28 13:15:09.616357,taquitobuddy,Incredible fun with 2 major issues,"This is the first game (VR or otherwise) I've ""completed"", beaten everything on the hardest modes (with the weakest fighter!), got all the achievements, everything.  It is so much fun and also a great workout.  Just the ""feel"" of the boxing overall is fantastic.  This would be 5+ stars from me, if it wasn't for 2 major issues that go together to bring down the experience. 

1st, the multiplayer is essentially completely broken.  Movement and hit detection are all over the place.  I thought maybe it was because I was playing people far away or with bad internet or bad PC's, but I have 2 VR setups on very high-end PC's with fiber internet.  Got 2 copies of the game to try out multiplayer, and nope, still incredibly buggy.  I don't know if this is a coding issue or just the fact that such fast and constant motions that require perfect hit detection cannot work over the internet in any game, period.  Anyway, bottom line is the multiplayer doesn't work.

2nd while the single player is extremely fun, if you are in good physical condition and have good reflexes/reactions, then it isn't particularly challenging.  Setting the game to the hardest difficulty increases the challenge but only in a 100% purely artificial way.  The opponents don't get any ""better"" they just take 200+ hits to take out, while your character can get knocked down from a single hit, or taken out of the match entirely in less than 20 jabs (not even powerful punches).  The multiplayer would have provided endless challenge, but that's broken.

So all things considered it is a very fun game and I can still recommend it, but depending on your physical condition don't expect to get more than a few hours out of this before the challenge is gone.  Maybe 10 hours if you are ok with the purely artificial difficulty.","Mar 27, 2019 at 7:47 AM",4, 10,

This game is designed to be a fun arcade style experience not a boxing simulator. Some have complained about the artificial stamina which requires you to put up your guard to regain stamina. I thought this was a great idea since it forces you to pace yourself which a real boxer has to do. If you want to really test your stamina try Thrill Of The Fight which I guarantee will wear you out since there is no artificial stamina and so you can fight as hard as you are capable. The training exercises are fun and actually relevant to the fights since the better you do in training the more stamina your character has in his next fight.

Additionally, the glint system is completely broken (on all difficulties) as the AI will sometimes 'glint' a hard hit, only to then decide not to throw that punch and throw a different punch instead, making the glints completely useless at best and deceptive at worst.","Feb 20, 2019 at 3:21 PM",3, 2,

It gets your heart pumping for sure. Simply punching air with the controllers in hand is a pretty good workout, gets me sweating in a few matches. The training workouts are rather dull and useless for me, unless you are role playing the movie. Punches seem to be tracked pretty well and getting a solid hit really feels good. I like the theme music.

Unfortunately, it pretty much ends there.  Firstly, the fighters are really bad, it seemed the only challenge came from them getting up more in the later fights so you would get tired. I found myself hating the stamina mechanic because it would say I'm tired when I myself could keep throwing punches just fine. Even worse, your AI opponents seem to have unlimited stamina. The stamina game is there make you stop and guard to recover, in my opinion, an attempt by developer to make fights artifcially longer. 

The location tracking could be better, I would have liked to have more of my movement in my room tracked instead of standing in one spot for the entire round.  In order to move you have to put your guard down and fake walk with your hands. This is a serious conflict in controls and makes you simply stand firm rather than risk trying to move. Why not just use the control sticks? The menus are too deep, you have to go through several useless menus to get to a fight, which is the only real point to the game. There's also no ""quit"" button. It's minor but really bugs me that I have to quit the app from oculus dashboard rather than have an in-game button on one of their many useless menus.

I would like to see them drop the ""training montage"" and just let you walk around the gym and do whatever you want when you want. Just leave it open for me to use like my own virtual gym. Fighter AI could be vastly improved as well.","Jan 19, 2019 at 9:22 AM",2, 4,

The thing that really takes this game down from a 5 to a 3 is the extremely poor locomotion control.  You have to move with your hands while fighting with your hands all at the same time.   Extremely unnatural feeling and focus breaking.  I wish they would add a thumbstick control locomotion option.

Overall, I would still buy this game as the PVP makes it all worth it.","Nov 28, 2018 at 7:49 PM",3, 4,

-A shortcut to establish a new center position.
-An option to hide the arcade vissual effects.
-Make characters blink! Sly is specially spooky because of this.
-On training games, I'd like to see my score every time, even if I don't beat my record.
-Being on the Gym, free locomotion system is very good, but in-fight is very awkward, whay can't it be like when we walk in the gym?
-An option to do endless montage (with score count) so we can workout!
-it would be cool to manage the amazing OST from Montage, to choose which song we want to hear, also for the fights.

So far the 'career' is boring and arcadey. Special affects to let you know you've hit something(stars and streaks) slowmotion affect when you dodge an attack and your gloves will glow when you're out of stamina.
Yep, stamina. Instead of reling on your own physical stamina the game creates it for you. Restricting you through the fight, so your expected to wait for your avatar to catch up. Ridiculous mechanic.
The ""advanced locomotion"" mechanic is pathetic. Forcing you to wave your hands about in order to move forward.
I thought the PVP would be it's saving grace, no.
Bunch of arm flailing kids, super easy to just shell, wait for them to tire, then go to work.
I've walked through every single opponent. So no challenge there.
If you like the whole arcadey feel then jump right in, you'll love it.

I hit him 40+ times after getting two knockdowns, and only getting knocked down once. He gets the remaining two knockdowns to beat me in THREE HITS. That I was guarding.

cons:
-multiplayer needs some tuning, theres weird short punches that can have the same strength as a windup, this needs to change.
-no indication of latency with sparring partner in pvp
-different movement controls in the ring compared to the gym, !?why?!
-prepare to sweat excessively

2022-05-28 13:15:44.372051,Groove1968,,"Going toe to toe online and in VR ! This has been a game that I have wanted someone to make for a very long time and am so happy to finally see it come to pass.

 I have read a ton about the stamina feature, and for Career mode it makes no sense. They could easily make the boxers exhibit thier own individual levels of stamina via how many punches they can throw before needing to cover up. Online however is a different story. The reason for that is players can use smaller quicker shots like rolls they would do to a speed bag, and because that takes very little energy i'm sure they put in the stamina as a safety net. Until they fix the ability to land shots that do damage using small swings they need to leave that feature turned on for online play. One thing they could do however is at least double the amount of shots needed to tire you out so that you can land some longer combos  and maybe score some faster knockouts. I have played 6 rounds so far online and am 5 and 1 the one time I lost was with a guy using the short punch method. The next two matches I had it figured out and didnt change the way I boxed and was able to beat him fairly easy, but it should still be fixed :)

 Unfortunately I have one other major gripe and its about the gameplay itself in terms of the rounds and how they play out. It is EXTREMELY arcadish here. If you knock someone down or are knocked down it automatically ends the round. It should continue with the said boxer needing to recover and should certainly go to round end, with the 3 knockdown rule in affect. 

 Even with the issues I have with the game it is by far the most fun I've had online in a long time. If they fix these bugs and gameplay issues I would give it 5 stars and could easily see this being a League game. I'd be the most in shape 48 year old I know...lol","Sep 28, 2018 at 1:54 PM",4, 11,

The only gripe I would have is there not being more elements to the story, not enough narrative. But the music, atmosphere and everything else can really bring you into the game and grab you, especially if you were a fan of Rocky before.

The campaign consists of ""Black screen that says X months before/after X fight"" -> Go train to get better stamina for fight -> Fight dude -> Rinse and repeat. And it takes like an hour to beat.

I hope they add more FREE DLC, non of that payed stuff.

After the campaign there is free play and the training exercises and PvP.

I can't help but feel like the tech demo feeling like so many other VR games, REALLY looking forward to the day that more VR games have a campaign that's at least 5 hours, 10 hours would be better.","Sep 26, 2018 at 3:54 PM",4, 7,

I re-set up my colus play space and now Creed reflects my actual sensor positions.  Thanks support team!

As for the game, it's fun!  I really enjoy the boxing aspect of it with two exceptions.  The method of walking forward (or backward) is a bit ridiculous.  Having to power walk swing your arms in order to move a few feet is annoying.  Why can't we just use one of the two joysticks??  The unfortunate thing is the developer has doubled down on this mechanic in order to get up after you have been knocked down.  I truly wish this ""feature"" was replaced with something else.  I prefer the ""balance"" meter type of mechanic from the later Fight Night games (or something similar) instead of bushwacking my arms like a fool when i am trying to get back up. With its current implementation, I can never get up more than two times at any point during a fight.  

That said, actual punching and blocking feels great.  Some more physical damage on the opponents face (and perhaps my vision) would be a cool addition, but I understand you can't have it all.

2022-05-28 13:15:47.586579,Daikuchi,Good with some minor flaws.,"Great game. Feels fairly realistic. Helps if you actually stand up and throw punches (watch your play space, I went through the guardian wall with a punch when chasing an opponent--bye bye lamp). There's potential for cheating by waving the controllers in short shakes instead of actual punching, which kind of defeats the object. Worst thing? The artificial stamina. Creed should be in better condition than me, not worse. All in all, great fun and a good workout but could do with a few tweaks to force actual punching (relevant most for PVP and rankings in the training games) and give an option to remove the stamina.

UPDATE: Finished the all-too-easy career mode but then there's PVP which is worth the price of the game. Great fun and much more of a challenge. Negatives remain the same and I'll add that I find the movement mechanic really glitchy in the ring, though it's fine in the gym area. Overall though, the negatives are outweighed by the positives.

It's just not one of those ""punch the fastest and see who wins"" game (except for online, kinda... we'll get to that in a second), but rather that you got to play strategically and plan your moves, blocks and dodges etc. Simply genius!        
And it feels very realistic! I love the idea of running out of stamina after a while, sure it's not the most realistic-working feature but that's impossible to do something about, I love how they solved it. 
About the online thing I mentioned. The thing is people just throw punches until the get tired which kinda sucks IMO (basically rolling their hands when fighting). That should be fixed so that it's a very ineffective way to fight, altough not a problem against AI. It also feels very arcade-y, which makes it less serious. Just something to maybe keep in mind.
My only REAL gripe with the game is that it is very short. Got a little over an hour of gameplay. I was totally enjoying myself until the credits came up and almost made me cry. A big problem in the VR-genre, sadly. That's why it got 4 stars instead of 5 stars.
