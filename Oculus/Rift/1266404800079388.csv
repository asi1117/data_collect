2022-05-28 18:28:02.159954,Masamune5454,A super fun VR binding of Issac.,"So i stayed away from this game for a while, becuase i didnt really know what to expect. i wish i had tryed it sooner. this game is great and while i like games like the forest and payday2 in vr. ya know big games with lots to do, this game does what it set out to do perfectly. I was impressed by the visuals, the cheap cardboard scenery and simple yet complex structure of the game drew me in deeper. the hands were beautiful and alot of VR devs would do nicely to stop ussing assets when it comes to VR hands and bodys. everything else is fine but those hands in vr pull you into the world. along with other immersive things like scary enemys and the scenery turning red when your spotted, like all hells breakiing loose. So gameplay, theres many weapons, so far ive gotten a crossbow(which has to be manually loaded, thank you Kartong.) And can use so many bolts. needles, gold needles, matches(fire needles that must be lit at fire source)Explodey ones. next theres a map a sword a toothpick gun and a grenade luancher and.....x ray shades and,,,, alot take my word for it. so imagine the strength in a binding of issac in VR. lots of loot and rougelike permadeath. i actually yelled when the rabbit jumped at me. the game i dont think is trying to jumpscare you, that isnt the point, it just happens. the fear comes from knowing you die, you lose everything. honestly im a big fan and i love the artstyle.","Mar 5, 2019 at 1:21 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:28:02.189874,blupajamaz,Simple and Elegant,"I enjoyed this title, the visuals are artistic and it instills a genuine sense of worry. Good locomotion controls that are not nauseating, or teleports if that's your thing","Feb 2, 2018 at 1:43 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:28:02.204834,jim1709,Actual Review on the game,"This game is a simple spooky survival crossbow shooter. The idea is so cool but the ""survival only"" thing bummed me out. I was hoping for a campaing experience where I would get chased and jumpscared. Not a Binding of Issac style weapon system. I feel like the trailer was also kinda missleading. Still tho might just be me and the price aint too high so yeah.. 3 stars","Dec 28, 2017 at 5:17 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:28:02.219794,chichi70,Cheap and bad jumpscares,And these jumpscares are not even a bit scary. Controlls also are itchy and do not feel natural at all. Sorry - but this is not even worth the 9 bucks.,"Oct 28, 2017 at 8:12 AM",1, 0,
