2022-05-28 19:30:59.192761,imagamer_17,Its a buggy mess,The chat would spawn far away from me and would move sides withpout me telling it too. The game would move me ever without useing the controller. Thowing against the wall. Being unable to move away from it. The shoping idea is cool and i do feel like im in a store. But i say the game is unplayble right not. Really needs an update fixings its bugs.,Jan 19 at 5:13 AM,1, 2,

2022-05-28 19:30:59.254596,byteframe,I like the idea.,"But this looks and runs too poorly to be enjoyable. It has some charm though, such that I might have been tricked into playing it twice.","Jun 7, 2021 at 11:37 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:30:59.269556,ewinmn,Needs Improvment,"This game is glitchy and needs improvement. The concept of the game is cool, but the game is literally almost unplayable due to things glitching while you play.","May 29, 2019 at 9:20 PM",2, 16,"There is a new version of Supermarket, with all fixed solved. I hope you enjoy it better this time."
