2022-05-28 13:01:25.472710,KingDGB,5 Star Game Mode,"UPDATE: So it's been awhile, and this game is dead. It's been dead, esentially since right after launch. When I said dead, I mean like 0 concurrent players on steam dead multiple times I've checked. 

There are bots I believe now, but I wouldn't buy this game at all for any amount of money. Ubisoft did miss the window, people do not realize how fickle the VR base is. This was a polished game though, and it ran like a dream, had they continued to update people would come around. 

*************************************************************************

So, I'm giving it 4 stars. I really want to give it 5, but I can't. For $40, there isn't enough to do. A short hour or two campaign would have sufficed. That being said the game mode is so fun that I bought it anyway.

The issue this game has right now is the playerbase. It's tough to fill a game. I've played a few hours and I think I've only been in 1 full game of 4. I feel like a lot of this is due to lack of support on the PSVR. Move support is coming, but I just really hope Ubisoft didn't miss the window. 

I think it would benefit them to give some cosmetic items, founder edition or something, to those that have paid $40, and drop the price by at least $10. Then, lay out the plan for future updates over the next ~6 months.

The Tested review said, ""They could probably sell 3 for $20 for every one for $40."". I think that's true.","Jan 2, 2021 at 7:40 PM",1, 21,

This was my first opinion about the game and I still agree with it, but something big has changed everything. The game is out of development and it's dead. No one plays it anymore and that's such a shame. The gameplay is fantastic, but if there aren't any new things coming to the game, it gets old and a bit dull. I bought this game for $40 and that's just a waste of money for a game that no one is playing. I do recommend this game for $5-10 but $40 is just too much. I think this game is well made and I would love it if it was popular and not out of development.","Jan 8, 2020 at 12:46 AM",2, 27,

2022-05-28 13:01:31.840978,CarloFromMilkyWay,,"I purchased Space Junkies here on the Oculus Store. BUT! The game requires a registration on the Ubisoft Store (!!!!). This is already a practice that leads me to consider this title less favorably. AND i must remove the Rift to start the launcher (uPlay) , which disincentives me and a lot of people to make even a simple casual match. I would add that the double login security system of uPlay is ridiculous, redundant and further frustrating. But the worst part is that my purchase is present on Oculus Store but not on uPlay. SO MY GAME WON'T START!!!!!!!! I can hazard a hypothesis: my previous download of a demo version of Space Junkies is in conflict, on the uPlay servers, with my purchase of the game. So uPlay doesn't recognize me as the holder of Space Junkies, but only of the demo. It is a hypothesis, of course. However, imagine how many people avoid to play with this game. This choiches of marketing help to decrease the already small platform of players. Congratulations to Ubisoft!!! Do you know who should be angrier? The developers of Space Junkies, who have worked on a good game to see their commitment frustrated because of the marketing service.","Dec 31, 2019 at 5:03 AM",1, 5,"Hello  I apologise for any frustration,  we are trying to fix the problem for a number of players.

2022-05-28 13:01:35.049057,DavidDay,"Very fun, but...","[update 3: Took a few weeks off to see if things would sort out. Came back on a tournament night...servers seemed to work great. New AI bot features great. Three days later...AI now broken and no connections in the lobby. Back to where we started. Sigh. I'll take another week off I guess. Keep checking in. But it's impossible to play now.]

[update #2: Still love this game, but it's now basically unplayable without ridiculously long waits. Those of us who bother to even log in anymore have takent to setting it aside for as long as an hour or more for a single person to join. (this is between 4-11 pm EST) It's a testiment to the quality of the game that anybody at all is still willing to wait, I guess. But I'm at the point of giving up on it, sadly. 

I have heard that 3x3 games will be available in the next update. Unless that's accompanited by an extremely aggressive recruitment campaign and heavily revamped lobby system, that will be a complete waste. It's viritually impossible to get 3 people in a game these days, let alone 4 or 6. As fun as a 6 player game would be, please, developers, make a revised lobby system and recruitment your first priority STAT, lest you lose the few return players you have.

If my improving rank has anything to do with the long waits, that needs to be part of the fix. I understand protecting the experience for new players, but if people are getting ranked right out of game play something obviously isn't working.]

[update: Lobby access was prompty fixed after i posted this review. I love this game. But it's quickly becoming a graveyard. Virtualy nobody playing.]

Occational crashes, and for the last 48 hours no access to the arena at all. Just the tutorial, which, after completing, simply freezes the game. No announcements about server work or updates. Just the same tutorial prompt every time I launch. If this is a known issue it would be nice if there were a prompt letting us know things are temporarily down.","Sep 1, 2019 at 3:47 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 13:01:38.162823,GTR886,the player base is dead,fun game at first but the player base is pretty much dead.,"Oct 1, 2019 at 6:00 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 13:01:38.182770,sullyy2k1,SO fun!,"Ok, simply put, this is the most fun multiplayer I've played on VR . It's so fluid and once you get your head around the controls, it's a blast. It reminds me a lot of Starblood Arena (RIP). Colourful, arcadey and lots of explosive action. The environments are beautiful and well thought out. The different colour palletes used across the maps really add a lot of visual variety. 

Also, there are a few game modes here to mix things up. I personally, prefer the free for all, as team mates scare me lol. 

The weapons all handle great and the tracking is perfect. Alll round, it's a really great game. However....

There was ONE negative (which is no fault of the game design). I was just playing for like an hour and one person in there was getting like 15+ kills and everyone else was getting like 0-5 (if we were lucky). It's annoying because apart from this person who was clearly a pro, everyone else I came across was like a similar competitive level. These fights were so fun and tense. But then this person would just come in and kill everyone.  It was like being at a party having fun and then someone turns the music off and sends you all to bed. Also, this can't be fun for that person either. Maybe due to the lack of players, he can't play with anyone his own level? I dunno, but he literally ruined the experience by being there lol. This sounds horrible, but you know what I mean.

I'm going to try again at a busier time and NOT with that person as I can see this being a really good go to game for me. I would 100% recommend the game, but just keep this in mind...

UPDATE - after playing a lot more, these things happen every now and then. But for the most part, it seems equally matched. It's quite sad to see the reviews that have marked this down for empty lobbies. The game is so fun and deserves so many more players! Still haven't tried 3 vs 3. However, considering one of my negatives was that the maps felt too large for 4 people, I am only happy about this! Great job :)","Jul 7, 2019 at 6:01 AM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 13:01:41.299027,Orcaloid,Beware of Uplay,"One thing I love about the Oculus client is the ability to sign in on different computers and acess your games. For instance, if my brother and I both have a copy of Rec Room it is easy for me to sign into Oculus on his computer and play with my user data through his game install. This is not the same with Space Junkies. You must have a Uplay account synced with your Oculus account and copy of the game. So when my brother signed into his Uplay account on my Oculus to test the game out, that was it. I cannot play the game on my Uplay account. I have to use my brother's and he must be signed out of his copy of his computer for me to play. So we effecitvely paid for 2 games and can only play one at a time. I have been with Ubisoft support for over 2 hours and still have no solution. Do not waste your time like we have, or be ready to tip toe around an incompetent game launcher and it's support team.","Jul 1, 2019 at 8:46 AM",2, 12,

They've done a great job in making the motion as comfortable as possible. I'm fairly susceptible to VR motion sickness, but I had no problem here after an hour-long play session, so I'd say ""Comfortable"" is an accurate rating. The recent deals seem to have brought in a good influx of new players, and I didn't have to wait long for a lobby to fill up. As you play and level up you get the obligatory little customization bits, like profile icons and the like. Overall, while I was skepticaly about this game at its original price, it seems like a decent buy now. If you see it on sale it's a no-brainer purchase.","Jul 23, 2019 at 10:03 PM",4, 0,

I love the gameplay and the lighting engine is superb. I can tell if I had a better system this game would be one of the best looking as far as shooters goes. There are plenty of fun game modes and the matches are just long enough. Lobbies are pretty much always full - the cross platform helps but so does the permanent 50% reduction in the original price.

2022-05-28 13:01:41.360861,superpozition,I really tried to like it,"I spent about 3 days just trying to figure out how to login to uPlay. It was such a hassle, I got a refund the first time. I gave it another go because of how advertised it was. Social impact :). 

However, when I finally got past the unnecessary friction (logging into uPlay after working with the support team), I began experiencing the game. And what I expected from the advertising hype and reviews was completely crushed by my actual experience.

- This game runs at $40 and feels closer to $5.99. The graphics are mushy, extremely low res and poorly rendered. Needless to say, nothing felt spectacular, interesting, or unique 
- The world feels like a sandbox
- the controls make me want to tear my face off. Rigid degree turning (not smooth turning) destroyed any possible immersion I could have felt
- having to hold the guns (or they fly off) was a pain
- the actual gameplay and purpose of the game felt very rushed and diluted. Nothing was exciting and I never felt like there was a point to the entire game


Conclusion: 
I really tried to like it. I gave myself weeks of getting past unnecessary login barriers, only to enter a subpar, bland experience that made me want to go back to a refund quicker than the first time. 

The fix:
- controls
- render texture maps at 4K or at least 1080p
- for gods sake, lower the price. This is not nearly close to that of a AAA game and shouldn’t be asking close to it. Even with these fixes. 
- create a purpose. What’s the reason for flying through space and shooting things other than just to fly through space and shoot things?","Jul 20, 2019 at 7:55 AM",2, 1,

Its more like, swing the thing and hope it hits then its over.

First of all cudos to making a space fight game wich is actually enjoyable,  Clearly a lot of thought has gone into making the controls and gamplay acessible for as many as possible while still being exiting enough for those hwo are less prone to motion sickness - great job

I initially had som problems getting the game to work but tonnes of help and support from the passionate dev-team on discord who did more that i could have expected to help me out. 

The player community is great and the cross compability with PS4 players is great for the playerbase and I am yet to experience an empty lobby!

One small issue - it need uplay and when it stops on the loading screen you need to connect to your ubisoft account - this took me a while to figure out as it didnt prompt me to do this in VR but on the desktop.

The cons: everything else.  From just trying to launch the game and realizing its Ubisoft so you have to install their garbage DRM to play, to getting into settings and realizing they used several of the Touch control buttons for the SAME action, with no way to rebind them, waiting around because the game is essentially dead after it flopped at launch despite them desperately cutting the price by like 2/3rds in one week, and finally getting into a half-filled match only to find the gameplay to be completely shallow.

If Ubisoft had released at £15 I wouldn’t have hesitated to buy it day 1.  However, I will NEVER pay north of £15 for a game that has no campaign and could be dead in the water weeks after release due to lack of a playerbase.  Let’s face it, in flat world a multiplayer only game can fail, never mind the niche that VR currently is.  Echo combat released at less than a third of the price and made the price of Space Junkies look stupid and rightly so.  IMHO I think that Space Junkies is actually a better game than Echo Combat and deserves to be higher priced, but £15 would have been the sweet spot for me, include a compelling campaign and £34 would not have been a problem.","Apr 27, 2019 at 7:29 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 13:02:00.281938,MAC_MAN86,Had high hopes but...so many bad designs,"1. Ability to Smooth Turn is a ridiculous grab and drag left/right method which you need an empty hand for! Snap turn is so unimmersive as there's no inertia
2. Move in direction of head OR hands is just daft! If you added smooth loco it wouldn't need those which allows us to LOOK FOR TARGETS and aim at them but fly to evade. You need full smooth vertical/lateral for this NOT X/Y AXIS unless you use sword to sword combat!
3. Can not change binds for own preference and 5 buttons for Rift ALL DO THRUST making no use for them.
4. Armery is just weird. You can't use your hand or gun pointer to select menus but must use Joystick directions. Then you grab an item and can't even test what it does right there! At times they all appear around your feet as you choose one and trying trigger does nothing as you'd expect and leaves you wondering how to get the gear up again to scroll it (use up joystick).
5. Your body is always a vertical target so there's totally no skill to tactics of flying in fast to become a smaller target. Also shields don't protect your legs in this way.
6. It's all for one combat and little tactics for coop as your voices give away positions in space!!! (a vacuum?). Holding the Crown is merely just that instead of transporting it to your base area.  Maps are just big rooms with no progressions to them. Just arcade respawns.
7. Just 1 female character (based upon statistics yeah but they'd feel the lack of choice a put off)
8. Laser guns have a laser range of just 2metres! They are totally useless for aiming with and so useless compared to the spaces you play in which guide you always in confined areas.
9﻿. No way to grab things e.g. the big balls (why 2?) for the mini-game in lobby but that's how shallow it is right now
10. Why make the Sword an item you select as your loadout when it will be used instead of your gun
Graphically cool and had high hopes but this game started with a spaceman idea and hasn't grown it's wings. Make the above changes then.","Mar 1, 2019 at 11:52 AM",2, 144,"Hello   We have tried to address yours and community comments. We have a new episode 2 and modes for you to try.

2022-05-28 13:02:00.329810,sadwanderer,"Great, But has a few scarce problems.","Going to leave my previous updates here for now, maybe they can help others in the future. I have finally been able to play the game, and I can safley say, it has been a fun time. I was able to meet some new people (though there are few now, or at least at the time I was playing there were few.) and we fought together and against one another. The game has EXTREAMLY well tuned shooting and controls, though I feel some people may get motion sick from the quick movement and camera jerks, I love it however. The weapons and collectibles are great, though I wish there were more characters and a bit more customization, but what we get is great. The levels obviousley were designed by people who played quake and unreal, with all the collectibles and health management that come with those games. All around great game, just a few issues like the graphics bugs, and low populations at times. Overall, I'd say grab it.

(Previous Problems)For some reason, and only on this game, My headset display and monitor produce an ""After-Image"" like effect on my screen.  I cant really give a full rating because i cant play the game. Hopefully a fix exists's or will exist in the future.

P.S I have discovered the problem I was having was caused by sli. for some reason if you have sli activated, the game can sometimes create a ghosting effect on nvidia gtx 1080's. Not sure if this can be fixed or not, but I have sent my file to the developer awhile ago. Hopefully this can be looked at and fixed for the future. Its too bad to play the game right now I have to disable sli before I start it up.","May 3, 2019 at 5:25 PM",4, 0,

Having now bought it I would definitely recommend it for a pick up and play mp shooter. 
It’s a highly polished game overall, with excellent graphics/sound and a fun game to play. 

My only issue at the moment is that I would like the option to turn smoothly using just the stick, rather than having to use gesture as well.

2022-05-28 13:02:03.450072,nawsterfeld,Tired of it already...,"So I gave this game a decent review at first, but tbh it's just annoying and broken in so many ways. For starters, the leaderboard? The fact that I can disconnect from a game and drop from 15 to 22 is beyond me. I understand you don't want to allow people to quit out if they're losing or something, but if I don't have a single kill or death or second in the game, not sure how I can be penalized for that. Also, ADD AN INNATE RADAR. Flying around aimlessly getting shot and gang banged isn't fun for anybody. If you added a radar like any other game with a competitve edge like say idk, HALO, you could actually make decisive choices on how you want to approach your opponent and gauge where to position yourself since you're actually aware of where people are at. Right now you're just getting shot from up down left right and dead before you even have a chance to find out where from. The reason people played games like Call of Duty and Halo back in the day is because they were functional. But every game mode is a total mess. Also, not having health recharge? Well who can predict how that's going to work out. Again, with no radar or rechargeable health, there's no chance for anyone to make real analytical strategic decisions whatsoever. If this game was played on the ground like an even surface then maybe this wouldn't be so detrimental, but the fact that you can FLY ANYWHERE, makes this game almost unplayable due to the absolute factor of randomness.


It's certainly not all bad, there is a fun learning curve to climb and a skill gap which makes things competitvely engaging as well as great graphics, but there's no way I can keep playing right now with the game as broken as it is. I got 4 prize boxes, but couldn't open them. I was playing with a person that only one person out of 4 could see. It takes YEARS to find anybody. Want to ""Team Up"" with someone? Yeah that takes centuries. Probably waited 15 minutes last night before giving up on that. Just tired of it... sorry.","Apr 21, 2019 at 3:20 AM",3, 7,"Hello  aaah  Yes the radar.. ..  The challenge of being in a sperical battlespace!!! We did a traditional mini map but it is a sphere and in stereoscopic it was not working at all.  We did a 3D map,  but then the orientation was changing so fast as you fly fast and vertical and it was very confusing in terms of situational awareness.  A couple of things that might help.  The audio is a major feedback to identify your enemy position because of spatialised audio.  You also have  a SONAR and a MEDKIT  in the equipment selection in the armoury. You access this on your watch   Intels also appear over enemies based on line of sight.    We have fixes, a new mode and map that are coming out next week in episode 1.    Matchmaking is still slow,  we are working on it.  

For team up it's based on an invite,   so if you invited someone who was there it should work if you send invite and they accept. If  nobody accepts then you will just sit there.  This has been flagged  and are seeing how to improve.

The Prize boxes are fairly easy,  you just shoot them and the prize appears.  But again you have to activate them on your watch.  Hope that helps

If you want to offer us cosmetics to purchase, let us buy exactly what we want. 

If you want us to also be able to unlock these same cosmetics, give us goals and ways to obtain them. Do not make it luck. Anything but chance.

Give us achievements, milestones. Let us unlock new colors for our guns by scoring killstreaks/headshots/lots of kills with that specific gun.

Let us unlock new outfits and colors for our characters by playing as that character and doing specific things as that character. (IE, healing lots of damage as Junker, or scoring sword kills with Buzzkill)

Loot boxes are the most toxic, unrewarding kick in the balls that has been plagueing modern games. 90% of the time the things we get are not what we want, and when we do get them, we miss the fun that came from earning them. We know it was just luck.


Game gets 2 stars for having really good gameplay though, aside from the mainstream greed that corrupted the progression, it's extremely fun to actually play.

2022-05-28 13:02:12.977479,EBoniFacio,Amazing,"What an awesome experience, blown away by this game! 

The controls are intuitive, it really feels like you're flying through space. The level design is colorful, fun and emersive, especially getting used to the traps.  All the weapons were fun to use and figure out (the two handed weapons took me some time). Sound design really enhances the experience, hearing your characters breath pumping faster after a kill streak or the sound of a players jet pack screaming past you makes the combat feel so intense!

Just buy this one!

A few issues though.

I couldn't figure out how to get to my armory, its was greyed out on my watch menu and was unselectable. Perhaps this is a Rift issue? 

Also, it would be great to have some music in the lobby, things can get a bit stale in there between matches.

Still, beyond happy with this purchase!","Mar 27, 2019 at 1:53 PM",5, 8,"Glad you like and thank you for your feedback.  The armoury on the watch should work.

2022-05-28 13:02:16.094773,Squadaloo,"Fun, but very light on content","It's a fun polished fast paced shooter.  It plays well, the sound design is great, and matchmaking is mostly quick.  The armory menu is a little weird, but otherwise the UI works well.

However, it's extremely light on content for the price.  I'm generally not one to complain about pricing of VR games since I understand the added development time and costs necessary to make a game for a nice userbase, but I've only had the game for 3 days and after 5 or so hours of gameplay I'm already starting to feel tired of the current map and mode selection.  Plus, I'm not a fan of the way the game gives a seemingly completely random weapon on respawn: It gives some players an edge right at the start of the battle if they get the right weapon/map combination which can be very frustrating.

It's an enjoyable foundation of a game, but it just needs a lot more content to keep it interesting.

EDIT: Unfortunately, in the short time since I posted this review, the playerbase has already pretty well dried up.  I find this has had a hugely negative effect on my enjoyment of the game as it seems like most matches are now dominated by one player who has stuck with the game since closed beta vs. a bunch of people playing causually.  Unfortunately, the only solution to this problem is ""more players"" which given the game's price tag I don't see happening any time soon.","Apr 7, 2019 at 5:05 AM",2, 2,"We do have more content coming in the next few weeks, including modes and maps,  thank you for your feedback."

2022-05-28 13:02:38.275920,Soulbrothernr3,Space Junkies:A Short & Honest Review,"A well made arena shooter game with attention to detail. The weapons are  pretty diverse and intuitive. Combine that with gadgets to play around with you'll find yourself constantly fiddeling around to find the most optimal way to hunt down other players.

The games visuals and premise reminded me of detached in a way.
Movement is handled intuitively, so by the time your done with the tutorial you'll only be focusing on weapons and gadgets . The immersive comfort mode made nausea no issue at all even when your zipping in about in 360 zero G.
It can however make it difficult to figure out where you are getting shot from. So you will find yourself dying out nowhere often. 

outfits come with tradeoff stats and gadgets include: shields , swords, sonars , decoy lures, medkits, etc. But you can only carry one on each shoulder. Doing multiple games against the same people you will find yourself automatically adjusting your gadget setup to their playstyle.

Maps are diverse  large enough without being to large, but pretty dull in appearance. Weapons health and armor are scattered throughout the map to use at your heart's content.

I personally am not a fan of pvp arena team deatchmatch games. So this got pretty stale after 5 matches. But for those of you who love a good skirmish. Definetly get this. It is without a doubt one of the best polished bugfree no bull*** shooters out there.","Sep 28, 2018 at 1:27 AM",4, 21,

All weapons have some depths to be fully mastered, just like the Quake series which I believe is an inspiration for Space Junkies. I like the idea that 4 players are chaotic enough for this type of gameplay in VR, but it also makes skill gaps and rockets(yes, you dam rockets!) much harder to compensate with teamwork. 

If theres something I like to add into the game, that would be (1) the option to battle independently instead of in teams, (2) spawn point variations and (3) team chat when dead / in the respawn zone. However if it's the devs design decision to leave them be I fully respect that and Space Junkies is still a very solid game regardless.

For now I could not equip the left-most and the right-most gadget, but I'm sure that'll get patched up soon.
