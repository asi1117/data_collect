But then, when you learn the controls, it's fantastic experience with amazing and funny theme. Testing agility and figuring out how to progress through the map is really addicting. Absolutely love it and it counts as an arm workout too, trust me!",Nov 1 at 5:30 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:42:59.114431,Purifier357,spider man the kosmonaut,Easily in my top 5 vr experiences. The level design and gameplay is second to none. I came into it on the quest 1 expecting to get immediately motion sick and played 3 hours in what seemed like the blink of an eye. A very polished simple game disign with an excelent visual style. !FIVE OUTA FIVE!,"Jan 30, 2021 at 6:56 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:42:59.158314,HunterTheHunta,Amazing game!,"This game is awesome. Most games I complete the objectives and not touch it again, but with this game I played it over and over. I have completed the game start to finishing 3 times now, and soon to be a 4th, 5th, and 6th time. I love how much skill it takes to play this game, and how rewarding it is to master the game. If you have plans on buying this game I highly recommended it.","Aug 30, 2020 at 7:26 AM",5, 10,
