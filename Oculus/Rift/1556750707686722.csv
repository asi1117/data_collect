The controls are absolutely atrocious.  You basically laser point at the car and hold down the button to accelerate or quickly tap to decelerate.  You often have to laser point at several cars.  After a few minutes you get the gist of the game and then it just becomes a chore.  Crashes are not even exciting.  You're in a God mode view.  You do have to look 360 around you.  More like a board game view that is slow paced despite the animations.  Just not fun.  On the plus side, there's lots of levels and the game works without crashing or gameplay issues.","Feb 12, 2018 at 2:55 PM",2, 3,
