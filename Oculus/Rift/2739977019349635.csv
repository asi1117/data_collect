2022-05-28 13:48:25.052394,MountaineerMac,Fun game!!,"Interesting, novel use of vr aspect and good puzzles. Nice job and kudos to the developers! I was thoroughly entertained. This game deserves more recognition! I hope there is a longer sequel in the works! Thanks!!!",Jan 15 at 9:32 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:48:25.067354,AlexisDeQuinara,Shows what a VR game can do!,"This game was truly made for VR. It's a great experience to really show what VR could be. I love that your sword has physics. There are runes for you to gather and being a short person I couldn't reach one, so I used my sword, jumped and poked it, knocking it off its perch. You can parry attacks, use your hands to climb a ladder or climb across a chain. There are also some fun puzzles. 
I would highly recommend this game for anyone looking for an ""experience."" Oh. I also love the voice interactions. When they offered that I thought it would be like ""yes"", ""no"", but instead they provide you with these entire speeches to say. And voice detecting bartering can be fun. 

The only downside would be that the game feels more like a sampler of what VR should/could be like... and now most of the other VR games I try are disappointing because they can't live up to this game.",Oct 29 at 7:07 AM,5, 15,

2022-05-28 13:48:25.096277,joeblowsupstuff,Overall fantastic,"The in-game immersion is so good, can do many interesting yet simple things. A few of the weapons are really great and the elemental effects are cool. Combat itself is a bit lackluster but not bad. Progression and actual level design are phenomenal. 3 hours to complete the game though... If it were double that time I would have said it was short but good enough, 3 hours is simply too short however, a real shame but with this in mind if you wanted to play an RPG on VR, this is darn good.","Jun 22, 2021 at 9:12 PM",4, 13,

2022-05-28 13:48:28.262934,c.chan0212,So much potential,"This game had so much potential, could easily become the best VR game. the exploration was good, fun, gothic environment. the rune hunting makes you explore the game. 
however, like most people have stated, the game is really short if you don't hunt for the runes, which are scattered through out each area. 
there is only a handful of enemies, some enemy come too close to you, which makes VR combat uncomfortable. 
the game could be so much better, if it had more enemy types, more puzzles, more areas. but the foundation is already there, they just need to dedicate more resources.","Dec 4, 2020 at 10:33 PM",4, 53,

- Good medieval atmosphere
- Easy to pick up if you're new to VR
- Fun to explorate

Negative points:
- Short playing time if you don't explore/collect the runes
- Not enough fight for a medieval fantasy game

2022-05-28 13:48:31.433594,Noxasa,Fun immersive VR Game,"I've had this in my library for a long time but never got around to playing it.  I'm sorry I didn't play it sooner as it was a fun interactive and immersive fantasy styled game.  The combat was interesting as it required actual blocking and swinging of swords as well as the aiming and loading of ranged weapons like bows, blunderbuss, magical staffs and more.  

The story line was simple but fun and it helped with the immersion quite a bit.  Probably the most challenging part was finding all the runes and maxing out the character attributes. 

I had a good 10 to 15 hours solid entertainment.  I would recommend people get this game if they're into fantasy style games.","Dec 16, 2020 at 9:10 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 13:48:31.448554,SimbaGMZ,Bad Slow motion combat.,Should have an option to disable slow motion combat. It breaks immersion for me and feels weird while fighting. Other than that if this gamed had such option it would have been perfect for me. I rated 2 stars because the combat is a huge part of this type of game and the slow motion just kills it for me.,"Dec 14, 2020 at 2:37 PM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 13:48:31.479471,AddisonHyena,Entertaining but short,"I bought this game on sale for half off. At that price, i felt it was worth it

An entertaining fantasy game that could best be described as fun but a tad too easy. By the last levels I was cleaving enemies in half with a single swing. The level designs are amazing, and while not terribly inspired, the story worked well. GOOD boss fights- I cannot emphasize that enough. I have had a lot of awful boss fights in more recent games, but I very much enjoyed these. The puzzles and traversal were fun and I enjoyed it.

I suppose the cons would be that the game was very easy- hunting down Runes was pretty straightforward, and while the enemies were tough they never felt dangerous. My biggest issue is that the game is quite short- I had played through everything it had to offer in 3 hours and theres not much replay value to the game. An arena mode to fight bad guys or maybe some side quests would be welcome.

Overall, an entertaining game, and one that makes good use of the potential of VR","Aug 5, 2020 at 2:46 AM",4, 75,
2022-05-28 13:48:31.493434,AliceHalley,The Okay-est thing I've ever bought.,"Genuinely not bad. I got it for Half price, and that feels like a good price. The Game on the whole works pretty well, but it's not very polsihed. It has clearly been put together using a huge slew of different asset packs, which isn't nessesarily a bad thing, epecially since it has been supported by a selection of its own bespoke assets. The only issue with using lots of different packs is that some assets don't look consistent with one another. But this isn't a huge issue as it isn't noticable in most places.
Most of the sounds aren't very good, lots of popping and clicking artifacts are really noticable, which is a shame.
The best things that the game has going for it, is the range of different mechanics and the voice acting. As for interactions and such, if you think you can do something, you almost always can. You can throw the stick for the dog, cook a fish in a pad over a fire, or climb on the underside of a fallen ladder. The game doesn't need any thorough tutorials because it is extremely intuitive and it knows it.
There are some neat mechanics in combat, which is pretty good. The level design, hidden trinkets, and environment art genuinely isn't bad either. 
The dialogue (although incredibly well spoken) is pretty cliche, and the story is too. I pretty much just wanted to skip all the dialgoue and cutscenes because they weren't particularly interesting. But then again, I doubt people are playing this for a story, they are playing so they can swing swords around at zombies and feel KNIGHTLY.

TL;DR:
Does what it says on the tin, even if it isn't very polsihed. Trades quality for quantity.
Pros:
-Extremely Intuitive Interaction
-Well put together levels
-Great voice acting

Cons:
-Sloppy Audio
-Extremely visible lack of polish
-Lack of visual consistency due to mixed asset packs
-Ocasional easy exploits","Sep 4, 2020 at 4:33 AM",3, 14,

I had a lot of fun!","Oct 23, 2020 at 10:10 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:48:34.606202,Elliott_Undying,The best disappointment,"TL;DR If you find it 50% off, I highly recommend.

First off, positives. It's fun. The combat is intuitive. The voiced characters are cool. The bartering system is cool. Interacting with the horses and dog was, honestly, the reason my wife and I bought it. The concept of voice interactions in game is a phenomenal idea that Bethesda needs to incorporate into their RPGs. The level design is interesting but simple enough to not get lost in with an efficient use of vertical spaces. The puzzles were interesting and well thought out. Searching for Runes was fun, but you didn't necessarily need them all for completion. The boss fights were well thought out, dynamic, and sequentially made sense. If your level designers could team up with Blade and Sorcery's team for their dungeon mode, you could create something amazing together. 

Now negatives. At times it felt like this game was a project for a game design class that they shot for a B and said ""good enough."" The immersion in the first keep and first few levels was incredible, but the same passion wasn't in the area after the final boss. 1 NPC you can't interact with, the horse, the dog, and a garden that felt like they were checking a box off on a syllabus. No forge, no archery range with a guy cheering you on, no men training, no tricorn hatted shopkeep demanding you come to the closet to speak with him when all you want to do is find runes. The effect was that I liked the world less after I saved it. I felt great after beating the boss, then disappointed in the final courtyard. You see all the NPCs you saved from the first map in a short cutscene, then they're not there to interact with in the final courtyard. I stole the blacksmith's hammer in the first part for fun and wound up not selling it with the intention of giving it back. I got emotionally invested in the world you made and specifically saving my character's friend, then got storyline blueballs at the end. Fleshing out that last bit would have made 5 stars.","Jul 18, 2020 at 9:47 PM",3, 16,
2022-05-28 13:48:34.623156,mark.mariani.77,Needs more adventure,"Very good game play but finished it in just a few hours. If your looking for an easier short game, this is for you. Better off with Asguard very large story line and dont mind repeating it.","Dec 1, 2020 at 11:01 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 13:48:34.639114,Huurk,"Great game, but a bit too easy","As far as immersion and interacting with the environment and objects go, the game is better than most I've played and very enjoyable.  The combat mechanics are very well done, but I don't like the fact that enemies seem to attack in slow motion.  I find myself parrying the attack that I see coming and then having to wait for the enemy weapon to hit mine.   It would be nice to have a difficulty setting so I can fight enemies in real-time.","May 4, 2020 at 8:33 AM",4, 50,
2022-05-28 13:48:37.758874,CarloFromMilkyWay,A good demo,"This game has to be reviewed thinking to what VR can offer now. We have titles as Asgard's Wrath, Half-Life Alyx, that represents the pinnacle of the market. But also something as Skyrim vr, Vanishing Realms, Karnage Chronicles, to talk about something that has the same ""fantasy flavor"", have a better value. First of all, the adventure is too short and all the different game mechanics aren't exploited. It seems to me like a demo that let experience to the player some good interaction with the VR world, but only one or two times. The graphics is ok, without anything really remarkable. I think that Shadow Legend suffer of the most common problem of the VR games: it is short and not so much inspired. It is like a demo that shows what the developers could do with more time or more budget.","Jun 2, 2020 at 8:28 PM",3, 7,

I'm really stoked for the next Game VITRUVIUSVR will make. However the sadest Part is that the game is played through very fast (3 Houres)...

2022-05-28 13:48:37.821706,Palieus,My thoughts.,"The immersion was spot on and environments were beautiful. The story's interesting and simple enough to follow. The boss looks pretty wicked. The voice acting was done well.  

Now just a few of my thoughts here, the game does feel a little rushed. Not a lot of content but the content given was mint. 

It would have been nice to have a few extra rooms without puzzles and just some straight up combat. I was only able to buy and play with half the weapons available before the story ended. They could offer another “play-through” with the weapons you collected after you finished the initial story. That'd make it more agreeable. 

First time to role play with the voice recognition!! That was fun! Big plus.

Collecting the runes felt like a side game. They don't reward you with anything. Wish they'd done something interesting with it. Maybe some bonus gold for finding them all or a new ability. Just some incentive. 

I bought this after they added the crouch button. I can't imagin trying to play without it. ""Blade & Sorcery"" could learn somthing from this. 

All in all I'm given it a 4 / 5.

*** Since this old post, 2 levels were added to the game along with some other improvements. Just wanted to thank the developers for sticking with it. Great job here =)   now a 5/5","Apr 7, 2020 at 9:16 PM",5, 23,"Hi Palieus, thanks for coming back to this review after the addition of new levels I really appreciate that, and I'm really glad you enjoyed the game!

2022-05-28 13:48:40.985393,jackburfy,Fun and immersive,"I had a great time playing this.
It's a bit short, I get the impression that the developers may have wanted to go bigger, but were limited in some way.
That said what is there is excellent. There are some excellent uses of physical interactions which make it a very complete and polished experience.
The graphics aren't amazing, but it doesn't distract from the gameplay.
I whole heartedly reccomend you give this game a try!","Mar 14, 2020 at 6:20 PM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 13:48:44.122647,KT_Phoenix,Fun and not too short,"I disagree with some reviewers that the game was too short (we always want it to be longer). Using an Oculus Rift, I took my time to explore the environments, get all the runes and treasure, and participate in all the activities not directly related to winning. Definitely worth the price. 

Shadow Legend is both a problem solving and a combat game with both untimed exploration and pressured crisis situations. The combat does have a little gore and some surprise aspects, and so may not be suitable for younger players (most 10 year-olds will be fine). 

I loved zipping around the flying stone platforms; it was real enough to make me a bit dizzy and watch where I stepped. Particularly when under archer attack from the zombie soldiers. (I loved being able to redeem them.) The graphics are not up to the standards of Lone Echo or Lucky's Tale, but there are a lot of really nice details and the game atmospherics are wonderful. Great use of light, shadow, color, and altitudes.

I can see how the 'useless activities' could be used to help you win the game (build up health or strength or win an animal ally, for example). It would be great if the developer chose to implement that idea on this or future games.

When I had a technical problem (weapons and transporter stopped working), the developer responded very quickly. In no time I was able to use both features and defeat the Cathedral Guardian. (Thanks!)

Glad to have this one in my library.","Mar 20, 2020 at 1:18 AM",5, 7,

Just finding stuff, exploring, climbing ladders, interacting with animals, fixing swords etc are so well done. Everything looks believable and the mechanics and controls are very intuitive.

2022-05-28 13:48:44.184480,JackJC95,"Good, not amazing.","Definitely one to get on sale as it's not worth the full price. Combat is fine (fairly similar to Karnage Chronicles and others), though hit detection on the sword can be somewhat finnicky at times. Length is about the usual, 3-3.5 hours for me (collecting everything and doing all optional objectives).

There is not a whole lot of combat in the game overall, and you'll spend most of your time doing puzzles/climbing around environments. These environments and the exploration is probably the best thing about this game though, and set it slightly above other similar VR titles. A fun few hours, but didn't blow me away.","Dec 15, 2019 at 5:10 AM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 13:48:47.268374,adam.poole.313,Not worth it for this price,"The game is beautiful in some places and pretty rough in others. It feels very unfinished as if a lot of items/characters/interactions are just placeholders for now.  For example all of the things you see in the trailer have no real purpose or function in the game.  The horse, dog, fishing, crafting, potion brewing, ect. you just do it in a courtyard at the start and another courtyard at the end. You just mess around with it once and then move on. It has nothing to do with the game. The game overall is incredibly short and easy. I beat it on my first playthrough. The final boss is silly and underwhelming and there are alot of bugs that required me to restart levels because I got stuck in a wall or in the air. I think this game is worth about $8 and will need a whole lot of fixing and expanding to justify the full asking price.","Dec 7, 2019 at 1:47 PM",2, 39,

2022-05-28 13:48:47.299292,mkarat,Must play for tactical players,"This should be only my 2nd review in years. But as I keep returning to play this game, I think it deserves it.
The game was a surpise to me, as I was expecting the usual hack-n-slash action blended with complicated rpg mechanisms. If you are for the fast paced action prepare to die early and a lot. Similar, if you expect complicated combo button pressing, recipes that need to spend a lifetime to comprehend etc go and play something else.
There is leveling up of course, both for the character and his weapons. But the whole game with it's attention to details and atmosphere is that it makes it shine:
1. It has the greatest shop/trading system in a game. Bartering, especially with voice recognition is great fun and the whole system makes you feel that you are in front of a real counter. (Attention to detail)
2. The game let's you explore in your own time (and believe me there is a lot you will miss if you hurry to the next level). The placing of ruins, gems, the riddles and all the secrets are among the best you' ll encounter, making you believe that you play an adventure. 
3. You control the pace of the game. You can run towards the undeads with your sword, or have your time to plan a more tactical approach. You can spent all the time you like to search for the clever placed coins, gems etch
4. Graphics, sound, combat are very well, but the 3 reasons above make the game great for me. 
This screams that the programmer(s) of this game, did not just want to publish a game, but put love in it. Good job guys/gals!","Nov 10, 2019 at 2:38 AM",5, 23,
2022-05-28 13:48:47.315249,blairian,Love everything but dialogue.,"This game is awesome. All of the elements really work well and, as a proof of concept, this passes with flying colors.

 One element took me out of the game: the script. You talk irl to speak in game. HOWEVER, this is ironically the most immersion breaking part. You play the Grand Master, who is often told that he is the greatest who-cares in all of the land of important-I-guess. The script forces you to speak as he would, which goes a little something like...

Sam: Hello, Grand Master

GM: Hello Sam! Merrily I meet thee anon and think fondly on my fallen, brave commrads who have risen from the dead at the beckon of Lord....

...and at this point I'm like:  uhg I'll just click the dialogue instead.

This is VR, not a stageplay. Design the character around what is natural for me so I feel like I'm in game. Don't try to project me on some rando, because it feels super boring from the get-go. 

Having said that, the speech recognition in bartering is possibly one of the best elements I've ever experienced. It's absolutely natural.

The combat is really fun, and you haven't lived until you accidentally set yourself on fire by touching a candle. The inventory system is awesome. Everything really works well. I would have liked something a bit more open and less linear, but early days, I suppose.","Nov 30, 2019 at 11:15 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:48:47.330209,TheVigil,Top Five Favorites,"I came across this one while browsing the shop and was happily surprised. This immediately shot up to the top of my favorites list. The melee combat can be a bit tricky, but it's an awesome game. The items and inventory system are awesome, and a lot of fun to use. The puzzles are engaging without being too difficult. And I love the little bonus objectives in each level and area. Definitely going to be recommending this one to anyone with a compatible headset.
My biggest complaint is that it's just too short for such an awesome game. I'd love to see a sequel, or additional content.","Nov 30, 2019 at 6:23 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:48:50.418108,Derfel75,Too easy too short,"It takes more or less 3h to finish the game (I collected everything is in there and did all the optional objectives), the puzzles and fights are too easy and you arrive to the last stage very fast. There are some intersting features and ideas tailored for VR but they are not more than mini-games to collect items or coins. The game is a puzzle solving game with some very easy and basic combat. The best wepon is the bow, very similar to reality and very enjoyable (after some practice is a very pleasure to hit everything in the middle!). At the end the graphic: the environment are realized very well, but I cannot say the same for many enemies or characters (the final boss is one of these).
If you like medival games and puzzle and can buy it with 50/70% of discount it could be a fair bargain, otherwise be careful there are better games out there.","Nov 15, 2019 at 9:09 PM",3, 10,

I would say if anything I would want MORE, like a free roam, or hoard mode.  Once you complete the levels there is nothing to do with your two cool new swords.  The belt moves with the headset so when you lean one direction or another it gets in the way of picking stuff up, I kept grabbing my sword or torch whenever I tried to pick things up.  Also, I thought the angel would look more... majestic.  Kind of has a loose nightgown on.

2022-05-28 13:48:53.600725,zindinok,A Taste of Fantasy in VR,"I haven't beaten the game yet, but after 4-5 hours, I believe I just beat the final boss and am playing the epilogue right now.

TL;DR: This game is more than the sum of its parts. It's the best overall experience I've had in a VR fantasy game to date, even though it's not the absolute best in every area.

Graphics (3/5): Eye-catching, but not top-tier (what do you expect from two people)

World (4/5): I'm not a trained expert in medieval/Renaissance architecture or anything, but the attention to detail in the game world is impressive enough to make me believe this is what the world should look like. It's the little things.

VR experience (4/5): One of the best uses of VR I've seen in a game so far. Certainly the best fantasy/RPG game to date, as far as I'm concerned.

Story (3/5): Medicore storytelling and kinda cheesy at times, but it's an actual story. I think most good VR games so far are just testing out VR's capabilities from a technological perspective. There's still a large gap between good storytelling in VR and good VR games with even a decent story. If I compared this game's story to other VR games story, its better than most.

Combat (3.5/5): Not perfect, but satisfying. I wish I could take Blade and Sorcery's (BnS) melee combat and put it in this game. I like the Archer in this game over BnS, but it's still kinda wonky. I didn't like the Crossbow in this game at all. Magic was slow and I kept going back to the bow. I have yet to see an unmodded game do magic satisfyingly so far (there's some Skyrim VR magic mods I still need to try). 

Music (3.5/5): The music is fairly subtle and I didn't notice it often, but when I do notice, it was solid and made me feel what I'm supposed to in a given scene.

Length (2/5): Assuming I'm actually in the epilogue at 4-5 hours, this game is very short. But at this price range, I don't mind that, given the other qualities of the game.

Replayability (2/5): While a wonderful experience the first time around, it's a one-and-done kinda game for me. I don't see any reason to go back and play it again unless it's to try out the different weapons. Given the price range and other qualities, I don't mind that though.

Overall (4/5): While not perfect, this game was a lot of fun and it left me wanting more. My ideal VRRPG would be this game with an open world like Skyrim or Witcher 3, 100-300 hours of gameplay, a compelling main story, and Blade and Sorcery melee combat. But for now, this and Blade and Sorcery fits the bill.","Aug 27, 2019 at 3:49 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 13:48:53.617680,CharlieSayNo,Excellent VR adventure,"This game deserves a higher profile amongst the similar VR hack n slash adventure games.

I was amazed by the variety of gameplay mechanics that have been included in the missions (everything from swordplay, bow & arrow to dexterity puzzles + riddles!)

There are not that many locations (and the game is not overly long) but a lot has been packed in to each one.

Biggest criticism is the inventory management which is too fiddly to use in the middle of a fight (I had a lot of weapons that I never got around to trying because it would have been suicide to try to switch).

A close second criticism is the voice acting which is absolutely dreadful - it sounded like a high school play!

Strengths of the game include detailed environments, fun interactions like climbing and decent combat with a variety of weapons. The final boss fight is also excellent – it does a great job of feeling dynamic and exciting without being too scripted.

2022-05-28 13:48:53.651589,HenrySlim,My best Rpg medieval experience,"I ususally don't write reviews but I think that the rates of this game is not fair at all.

THE BEST:  For me of this game is the mechanics. This game was done for VR and Shadow Legend use all the potencial to use your hands and this for me make the difference. I don't like to make comparisons but I have Skyrim and the fight and the mechanichs kill the game. A game for VR need to be done for VR and use the mechanics of VR like Shadow Legend.
 
The battle are great and the weapons are fantastic. The bosses have original attacks and I liked to block swords because seem very real.

GRAPHICS: The graphics are very good and I enjoyed the atmosphears.

MUSIC: The music is a part to improve beacouse sometimes is very repetitive and I turned off in some episodes.

THE WORSE: The game is not too long but if you like to explore and enjoy everything It will take around 20 hours or more that I think for the price is fair.

To VITRIVIUS VR:  Congratulations for your game.
                             I can't imagine if you will do an open world with this kind of
                             mechanics. This will be amazing and I will pay more money for

I really wish it was longer and just wanted to continue on with the story. I felt like it was going to be longer because you keep collecting loot to sell for gold but there is no point after a certain point in the game. I feel like the should have been more enemies to fight. I feel like i rarely used the weapons that i bought. There should have been more combat in the game. The boss fights were decent but it's the most action you get. the majority of the game is collectiing ruins that don't seem to really do anything and collecting items to sell for gold to buy weapons you most likely will never get the chance to even use.  All those things were fun to do but i wish there was more to it.,"Aug 25, 2019 at 12:44 PM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 13:48:56.768334,mishka11,Amazing. Absolutely amazing!,"Ive played a lot of VR games this past year. And Shadow Legend was one of the only ones that I didnt want to take a break from! I literally spent my whole day playing this one. It had a nice balance of exploration, puzzles, finding objects, interactive elements and fighting/shooting baddies. Personally, Im not a big fan of shooting/fighting. But this game puts in sensible and fun fighting without over doing it (although the 2 boss fights were not easy).  The scenery artists are brilliant...the complexity and depth of the environment is unique and immersive.

All that said. The purchasing weapons stores could be improved.  
- There are only 2 points in the game where you can buy weapons. Itd be helpful if we could teleport to the store for purchases as needed. There are levels where purchasing a sword is not as useful as a gun or bow
- It would be nice if we could use our money to upgrade our weapons instead of only purchases.
 - Would have loved to purchase healing potion along the way.
 - Switching out between weapons is a bit clunky. Would have loved some way to pause the fighting during the 2 boss fights.. There is literally no time to change out weapons or use healing potion. 

Still a 5 star game. Honestly...I wish there was another 10 levels to this game...I would gladly pay the incrased price. I'll be waiting impatiently for more games from this developer. Perhaps a sequel??? Many thanks to the devs","Aug 11, 2019 at 10:06 PM",5, 10,

This game goes above and beyond to provide a wide array of VR mechanics that actually work like they are supposed to. Plenty of unique melee and ranged weapons, Assasins Creed style wall climbing, a real and interesting plot, cool supporting characters, interesting puzzles, and plenty of enemy variety made this game the best VR experience I have had to date, and I've played most of the ""AAA"" experiences. 
Also, THANK YOU DEVELOPERS for incorporating pagan/nature religion symbols respectfully and accurately. I am a new age pagan myself, and I hate seeing media use the pentagram as a ""demon worshiping"" symbol when it really symbolizes the elements and the balance they create.

I really like the puzzle aspect as well, you don't need to solve riddles or search around, but if you do you can get some really good weapons and a lot of gold.

This is one of the best experiences in VR. I got this game on sale (Daily Deal) for $14.99 USD and it was a steal of a deal. Yes, the game is too short (3+ hours to finish with trying to find runes) and the end boss fight was not very good. However, almost everything else in this game was nothing short of excellence. From petting your dog, giving it a treat and playing fetch or from putting bait on your fishing rod, throwing the line on the water and then the reel mechanic for catching fish to cooking up the fish and feeding it to said dog, there's an amazing level of detail in this game. It does need more content to be a fully fleshed out game, but what's here is nothing short of amazing and proof of concept for the VR game of our dreams. This is what Skyrim should have looked & played like. Mix this game with the huge open world of Skyrim and this game would have been the best VR game ever.","Apr 23, 2019 at 10:24 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 13:49:09.479798,ccdeltabeta,Zelda + Skyrim + Beat Saber = This,"Zelda for the gameplay and exploration; Skyrim for the atmosphere; and Beat Saber for that incredibly obnoxious final boss.
This game has a good level of immersiveness by performing everyday taks; whether it's playing with a dog, frying up a steak, or finding runes/coins to collect.  When combined with fighting enemies, the only task that seems to be missing is paying bills and collecting taxes.
The graphics are very nice (although trees are a bit 2D); easy to identify what things are, and the ability to admire the details in some items.  The only graphical hiccups I've had is when I maxed all graphics and tried smooth turning; only then did things get choppy (apparently, I've found a max capability when it comes to a i7-8700/GTX 1070Ti).
Thankfully, for myself, the controls were configurable enough such that I found a comfortable scheme (e.g., smooth locomotion/strafe on the left, smooth turning on the right).
The enemies were 'nice' enough looking; sort of a mixture between Zelda and Castlevania at times.  
If I only would've waited another couple weeks to buy this, I would've gotten 20% off. For $24.99, you can make a arguement that the price is too high for the length of gameplay; it is only because I do not recall other games with this type of gameplay in VR (not including Skyrim) does it make it easier to accept the price.
I'm glad I played the game; a thrilling and wholesome VR experience EXCEPT for that final boss, where I thought I was playing a combo of Beat Saber and Dance Dance Revolution; really felt out of place with the rest of the game.

my biggest complaint about the game is where the hell is the rest of it? this seems more like a demo then anything else- you introduce alot of great mechanics with good potential to them, but the game is sooo short that you only ever get to do anything once. maybe thats the point of this, they're testing the waters to see if its worth their time to build something more expansive? in my opinion, you've got alot of potential here, so yes it is worth your time.

First of all textures are the best seen in any VR game, even better than Ethan Carter - and similar to Lone Echo. But the big difference is that while I have to accept 45 fps asw in Lone Echo using super sampling (ss) 2.0, Shadow Legend performs at solid 90 fps ss 2.0  - twice as good as Lone Echo - how utterly impressive is that!!? Even in the courtyard with 6 people animated, a dog and 3 horses - and a giant castle to render I get solid 90 fps with super sampling 2.0. Felt like I had upgraded to a 2080 Ti, but I'm using an oc'ed GTX 1080 (7700K + 16GB 3200). Touch controls are simply perfect too - movement and weapon hands are separated, so choose whatever you like = perfect support for both left and right handed persons. 
3D sound effects (positional audio) and the music are awesome too, everything feels like reference in this game. Didn't get to test the voice recognition, because it requires a Windows 1803 update - and I'm not sure I want that update for now :-)
Collect all Runes and gems/gold, read all books, solve all optional mini-quests and tasks etc. and you may easily spend 90 minutes in just the first 3 locations (black smith - courtyard - mage). It'll probably take me 20 hours to complete this game and finding all the stuff ;-) Also I played some fetch with the dog, we then ate a roasted beef together, I smoked a pipe and fed the horses some carrots. No other game has such love for details - making the world come alive and seem real. And do check out the polygons and textures on Doran's eagle - totally cool stuff, right?
This is VR at its finest, I've waited years to experience quality like this, a great THANK YOU to the developers for making one of my dreams come true. Man, do I really have to go to work tomorrow? Sigh... :-)","Mar 8, 2019 at 7:11 AM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 13:49:12.650470,Siccors,,"A seriously rounded upwards rating. 

The good: It is a solid real VR game. It looks fine, some nice surprises, and no screwing around with opening boxes with a button, you open stuff with your hands. Bow isn't the best implementation ever, but it is solid.

The mediocre: No inverse kinematics, so floating hands, and the arm parts connected to it don't even point in roughly the correct direction. They did make sure you can't tickle enemies to death, but still the actual sword usage is questionable to me. Currently shoulder which isn't 100% , so that isn't helping either, but it remains a mediocre implementation to me (note: I am not sure if there are actual good implementations). 

The bad: it is short. 3 hours according to Oculus for me (and I feel that is closer to 2.5h than 3.5h). I would say that is a quite normal run, I am casual VR player, so not close to a speed run, but also didn't collect everything (seemed to become more of a grind to me).
Now I am not a developer, but I don't get it. You have the story made, the game code is there, the textures for the different enemies. Yet little is done with them. Even some more filler stages would have been fine. So the good part is that there are no filler stages (eg, just a room of enemies you have to get through for example), the bad part is that there is just little. You can buy new weapons. Great huh? I didn't get enough thingies that I could use the special bows. The 'cannon sticks' I could use, but didn't really consider to be great. And who cares about the special swords, since you get good ones for free anyway, and in the end it is mainly boss fights, not many minions for which a better sword would be useful. Quite some time of my 3 hours were spent collecting coins (felt more like stealing them tbh), which are only used for buying new weapons, which were not useful anyway.

So the TL;DR, the basic is there, even though I am not a big fan of the sword. But it is just too short.","Apr 17, 2019 at 4:11 AM",4, 0,

Practically everything in the world is interactive and behaves as you would expect it to. There is so much to do in each room so far, just in the tutorial opening section.

There is a bug others have mentioned where the loading screen hangs. I found I could get past that by alt+tabbing off and back onto the game, hopefully will be fixed soon!","Mar 8, 2019 at 6:26 AM",5, 6,"Hey there, thanks for the review and letting us know!

2022-05-28 13:49:15.760256,Singland1,Good game,"PROS
-great mechanics like climbing, throwing, sword fights feel good.
-Music is good and really helps with the atmosphere during some levels
-The story is obviously made in a ""cliche"" or a classic ""hero saves the day"" -style, this was cool and pretty cringy at times but ultimately a positive.
-Looks pretty good, there is a lot of color in the enviroments early in the game.
-First boss.
-A lot of loot hidden in the levels, and secrets that you can only find by using your own head, like riddles that I absolutely loved solving, more of those please!
-Did not counter any bugs.
-There is a way to ""abuse"" VR to circumvent some puzzles.
-Game has a cool mechanic that lets you immerse yourself into the game by using windows voice recognition, you can use this to talk to characters and it works well.
CONS
-Jumpscare
-""The story is obviously made in a ""cliche"" or a classic ""hero saves the day"" -style""
-The last boss fight made me go like wth, you literally play Ping Pong with the boss 7 to 9 times while increasing in difficulty. I hated this, i wish it would've used the climbing mechanics and maybe moving platforms since the floor under your platform was lava, the trial and error ping pong wasn't fun after the first 3 fireballs turned into ice.
-Models on some characters are pretty poor.
-Voice acting and the dialogues weren't the best, It wasn't a con for me, but I can see some other players viewing this as a con.
-This game has some VERY cool weapons and doesn't let you use them barely at all because it is so short. DLC please or a part 2!
-The angel who guides you just holds your hand too much, for example there is this bossfight that would've been so much better if the would've let the player figure the solution themselves.

Overall
This game works well, has a lot of potential in a sequel/DLC and was really fun to play for the little time it lasted. I wish i could write a longer review because of the cap in Oculus store. 3/5 would totally buy from a sale!","Mar 11, 2019 at 8:14 AM",3, 5,

I like how you can interact with most things around you even if it didnt really play into the main story. Great Job. Hoping that you come out with more or a 2nd one. :)

p.s. I see alot of complaints about the end boss. Honestly I thought it was fun and challanging. Sure you have to be quick, maybe some peoples reflexes are not as honed but i got to sweating by the time I ended him, idk but I thought it was cool :)","Mar 18, 2019 at 9:34 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 13:49:18.931876,SpitFyr,Great interactions with World,"An awesome game here, and I believe definetely worth the five stars!

The Good:
-Many interactions with the world, climbing, climbing with pickaxes, cooking, filling things up... the list goes on.
-A bartering system (which is neat, but not particularly important to the game)
-Neat enemies, and fighting mechanics
-Amazing and fun weapons
-Good puzzles
-Awesome game appearance (minus a few lack luster textures)


The Bad:
-Pretty buggy, in the beginning the game crashed everytime I wanted to change areas (no longer seems to be an issue)
-Voice acting pulls me a little out of the interactions (specifically evelyn, with poor lip syncing)

Overall, a great game despite the initial bugs I faced! Well worth the money I spent, and I hope to see mroe from the creators of this game with a little more budget on textures and things, but awesome mechanics with what they had!

The final boss battle, reminded me of beat saber and how ""Haha! You aren't even on my expert+ level!""","Mar 26, 2019 at 12:55 PM",5, 6,

Pros:
Visuals are good
Has smooth tuning and you can adjust both walking  and turning speeds.
The bow mechanics are nice.

Cons:
Not really an RPG, no quest system, no leveling, and very linear.
Scale is off; I feel like a midget on a world of giants. I'm about 6' and everyone is larger than me by a foot.
Really need a height adjustment in the settings. It would be really nice to be able to play sitting down, especially after a session of Beat Saber.
No jump button??!! Really??!! Nothing more imersion breaking than not being able to jump up onto a rock or chair.
NPC's are very robotic in movements, don't seem like real people, especially if you are comparing it to Skyrim. The standing movement isn't even natural.","Mar 12, 2019 at 5:32 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 13:49:18.967780,Scubidoobie,"Four, not five. Great game but SHORT","First off, I really enjoyed this game. Just played it from start to finish (About 4 hours?). Not sure I will play it again (to try and get all the runes) as there doesn't seem to be a point. The second you get a good weapon it is replaced.  There are not enough levels or diversity to keep me coming back.

Do I feel it was worth the money? Kind of. It was very enjoyable and had a few really good moments. It really... REALLY needs side quests and some exploration options though. If you like Skyrim and would be okay with about 2% of the content Skyrim has (but made for VR so it feels much better), then go for it. If you want a deep and rich world to play the game in that keeps you coming back to find new things, maybe this isn't for you.

Again, I really enjoyed it, but in the end it felt like it ended way too soon with not much reason to go back and do it again.

Would I buy it again if I knew what I know now of the length of the game? Probabaly...","Mar 9, 2019 at 2:03 PM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 13:49:18.984242,sethwmax,A big step forward in VR gaming,"I love the mix of all the best VR has to offer right now--how you can walk, talk, use bows (with great physics), staffs, and swords. All the interactive environment touches are great too. I'm 2 hours in and have never been so pulled in to doing every little side quest and complete every collector bonus. It's just that fun to move around in this world. 

Only complaint is that I am also experiencing the loading issue where every time you walk through a door or advance to another area of the game it hangs and I have to restart the app and reload everything, which is super annoying. Hoping this gets patched soon, because otherwise it's one of the best VR games I've played. If not for this, I'd give it 5 stars.

Basically everything in the world is interactable and it's just great. There's fighting, puzzles, climbing, magic, mic recognition, basically every great thing you want in a VR game. Also for a nice touch there are lore books throughout the game you can pick up and learn about the world. If you liked Skyrim but wish it had more VR features this is totally the game for you!

EDIT: Everybody complaining that this is nothing like Skyrim, you have to remember this is a small team making a VR only game. Skyrim was just a port from a giant company. You have to change your expectations of what a VR game is. The only games out there that are totally open world with hours and hours of content are video games that have been ported to VR. Give this a chance! It's a really fun time and it really showcases how exciting the functions of VR games are going to become.

The puzzles and interaction with objects are animals are great. Finding the runes is fun. The combat is better than I thought it would be. Totally worth the money.

Having said all that, I wish the game was longer. Also I had a technical issue where when I would switch areas, the screen would go black and not bring up the loading screen. I would have to exit the game and start it up again and it would continue in the new area.

2022-05-28 13:49:22.138895,Crumbled_Sanity,So much potential!,"This is a game that explores numerous mechanics that could be well developed in a VR RPG such as this one...
That is literally about it, the game is relatively short and does not use the mechanics numerous times despite the use of it in game. However... It is because it uses that that it could just as easily inspire more VR RPG's like this one to try and expand upon this and add more.

The combat... Though kind of simple, is enjoyable from time to time with a fair amount of difficult **except the cathedral and final boss** and the overall graphics are impressive.

The story is somewhat cliche but that doesn't mean it is bad in anyway, it is actually quite simple, straight forward and easy to engage with once you learn about the lore and use the microphone feature to immerse yourself in game.

I am no professional reviewer but from the time I've spent in this game... I can easily say this is one of the most entertaining experiences I've ever had.
BUT! There can be improvements... For what the game's worth, the game could be extended a little bit and there can certainly be overhauls on certain parts of the game to make it feel more unique.

Each area has a lot to explore and interact with, with there own individual style. For those that enjoy a checklist of activities and things to collect this is for you. In that regard it reminded me of games such as tomb raider but contained to smaller areas. Combat, leveling up mechanics, buying weapons all could be of been left out completely unfortunately due to the fact that combat rarely occurs throughout the game and when it does it can feel clunky (in melee). This is not a dungeon crawler, it does do exploration well however. Look forward to expansions or sequels as the developers definitely show talent here.","Mar 11, 2019 at 7:03 PM",3, 2,

It has been mentioned by other reviewers so I know i'm not alone, but the issue with loading new areas is really game-breaking.  Every time I change ""zones"" I get a terminally long loading screen that forces me to close the game and restart it.  At least when I restart I am in the area I was heading for.  It may sound like a small thing, but it really breaks the continuity and fun having to keep doing this.  If they would find the problem and patch it, I'd easily give this 5 stars... actually it's so annoying I almost gave it less than 4 stars but that would be unfair.

This is a truly cool game.  Graphics are good, gameplay is well thought out, so much stuff is so interactive... I'd give details but finding out what you can do is half the fun... it's a lot.

Its obviously alot smaller game on a smaller budget & seems an odd comparison i  wouldn't really even class it as rpg as it so linear. I think Karnage, mages tale are more similar.  
The game mechanics are good, has all the right options.
Interaction is very good, some of it is gimmiky or i should say doesn't add a huge amount to the game play but some things really did work well like bidding in the shop. 
Graphics are a mixed bag, the charachter models, animals & weapons are poor imo but the enviroment was mostly well made.  
I found the art style a bit generic & lacking its own identity, although this is an issue with alot of vr titles. 
Gameplay is basic & felt more dungeon crawler than rpg it was also really easy. Its short but if im honest i couldn't see myself playing it for a long time anyway. 
I didn't really gel with the melee, i felt sorry for the badies that they had to make it so obvious where they was hitting me.

The it loads to 100% and I get to watch the hourglass spin for 5-8 minutes at a time... anytime you leave an area.... This is unacceptable on a release. Have 8th gen I7, 1080GTX FE... there is no reason for this. will change review if fixed... unplayable as of now.","Mar 18, 2019 at 5:36 AM",2, 1,"Hey Godisreal, I'm sorry to hear about the long loading, a few users have mentioned that if you press ALT-TAB, or minimize the game and reopen it seems to load for them when your in this hourglass state, but please email me at contact@vitruviusvr.com with what exactly is happening & where, we're still trying to get this fixed permanently, it's just been very difficult to figure out what is going wrong.

Just bought your game, but it wont go past the starting screen. any idea's on how to fix this? I've already tried your solution for the other guy by running it as admin but that didn't help.

My Quick Thoughts:
Everything about this game has been done flawlessly and this is the game ALL VR developers should aspire to! 
In this game you think to yourself I want to be able to do this, and I want to be able to do that, and you know what? In this game it's possible.
Shadow Legend raises yet another bar for realism in VR.
This is a game that all other VR games should strive to be, in quality, polish and execution.
Shadow Legend really shows off the true potential for VR. It takes a leaf out of Skyrim's book, builds upon it from the ground up with VR in mind and delivers an incredible 'jaw dropping' experience that outshines anything else on offer.
Simply amazing!","Mar 8, 2019 at 4:26 AM",5, 8,
