2022-05-28 17:26:27.058992,ChosenNub1827,Can't even play a single match after 7hr,"The game is not even good due to player count and there never being a tutorial for the player, I wish there was a way to test a mech or even understand how the game works but instead you get a stupied little note with instruction which it was not even good to understand the gamplay and I recommand not even waiting for a long time like me, and good luck finding a single match after 2 days or more since that is how much I waited to try the game at least once but I never got the chance to.

AND.....even if you like the multiplayer stuff good luck finding a game to join. I've collectively spent about two hours waiting in the lobby for a game to join just to try it out.......never once connected with a game.

2022-05-28 17:26:39.707163,atlas1254,Might be a good game - but sucks,"You need a partner to play with ... and down it goes:
You have to try 5 times to find a matching partner.. each time costs you about 10 minutes. You might not even find anyone for a whole day. I installed it a few weeks ago, tried it a few times. Without any success. A few days ago I tried again... it worked 2 or 3 times (with long long long waits for ONE partner - not even team agains team). Then you can play about 3 or 4 minutes and then... wait another 50 minutes (or do something else, but you could miss a match).
I once was paired with a partner (yeah ... celebration... rare like a birthday... awaited the game...) but the partner did go offline in the meantime. This thing is so frustrating... Probably deinstall... if the developers don't fix it. 
When you are waiting for a partner... you really have to wait... stand there and watch... you can't go into a robot... you can't go around... you just have to wait... a long long time... for perhaps nothing. If the payed game is the same, then it would be a waste of money... so not buying it.","Jan 23, 2020 at 6:10 AM",1, 28,
2022-05-28 17:26:39.722123,The-Ry-Guy,Scratches that mech itch,"Feeling like you're piloting a mech is great fun! You can focus power on four different things: attack power, shield power, speed, and how fast your energy gauge fills. 

At certain energy levels, you can activate two different abilities. Each mech has its own. This can make for some frantic moments to focus on shield or attack power, when you're on the defense/offense. 

Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of players online. I could see tournaments being a fun thing.","Dec 14, 2019 at 1:27 PM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 17:26:39.737083,Darkwacky,You don't get to play,"IThis game looked like fun and I was looking forward to trying it out before I buy it.   However the tutorial is just a bunch of text to read and the only option is to play.   But like other reviewers have said Noone is online.   I saw 2 people searching for 2v2 matches.   Even if I were not one of the 2 that is only 3 people and not enough to play.   

Devs if you are reading this you need to add a single player tutorial where a player gets to try out the mech and even if it is to shoot a dummy.   Give us an idea what the controls are going to be like and the game play wihtout having to wait for somone online in a pool of noone.","Nov 21, 2019 at 7:43 AM",1, 24,

You don't go to war if you do not have a chance to practice inside the mech. Don't get me wrong, it is great to be able to play for free. Playing blind folded is not a good thing. Some people are more visual then reading.

On a very good note, we waited and 2 more people within a few minutes came on board. It was a good experience but getting killed within minutes is not fun.

Sad! It wakes so much expectations!

Remark for the paid version (5 Stars):

It's odd, but the version for free is another app than for paid. If you make the inner purchase in the free app and then pay via the webpage you have to install the paid app in addition!
The paid version is very great, the free version doesn't work. I give the free version 5 stars since you otherwise won't buy the paid one and not judge this incredible good game.

2022-05-28 17:27:01.788104,JeremySr007,One of the best VR games ever made!!,"Real walking with thumbsticks, no teleport!
Incredible graphics!
Destructable environments
Awesome weapons
Awesome mechs
liquid smooth, (dont go by the youtube video, download and try it!)
Great sound and music
Voice chat
1v1, 2v2 for free
Built for the Oculus Touch controllers, so everything works just right
Absolutely ZERO VR sickness
Fully adjustable graphic details. I have mine set on max for everything and im getting perfectly rock solid 90FPS.
Perfect and natural feeling gameplay.
Super fast load times into the main game lobby area and also super fast loading into the 1v1 and 2v2 actual game. I dont yet own the full version, but I assume it will be equally fast loading into 3v3, 4v4 and campaign modes. 
FREE!!!!! (for 1v1 and 2v2). 

Yes, I wish more VR developers would offer a piece of their game for free like this so we could try it out and see if we like it before buying. I happen to REALLY like this, so I will be buying it! It is crazy to purchase a full priced VR game before buying. Some games have wacky controls, poor gameplay, choppy framerate, VR sickness problems or other bugs that dont show up in a youtube video. This game is about as perfect as you can get for every aspect.

If I could, I would give an extra 6th star to the rating of this game for the developers making this demo portion free. It really is that important for VR games to include a playable demo. Thats how games used to be in the Doom1 and Wolfenstien games.. the first few levels were free so you could try the game out and see if it works well on your computer and see if you enjoy playing it.

I would recomend playing this free demo and trying for yourself.
The only thing I would add to this amazing game would be a nice VR lobby to hang out in, add friends, chat, team up or just relax in. As it is now, the lobby is just a map select screen where you can chat while looking at the names of the other players waiting for the game to start.

2022-05-28 17:27:08.119171,ooolookafishy,Skeptical at first...but this is amazing,"Naturally a little hesitant after reading some reviews BUT THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD DREAM. This game is awesome. I'm not really interested in the single player stuff (I hear it's rail based) but the multiplayer is a lot of fun. There is a lot of tactical stuff behind customizing the mech in game during battle (for example, I crank the speed up to return to a battlefield after dying, or jack up my defense when I'm low on health). It's ultra fun. Even though there were only 30 people online the longest I waited for a game was 3 minutes. In response to other complaints about not knowing how to play - read the tutorial. For developers, a interactive tutorial might be a good addon (like Lone Echo does) for people who dont want to take the time to read. But maaaaaaaan when you enter that lobby and the mechs are all lined up and the music is cranking....it gets you pumped UP. I'm surprised how well the graphics looked running with a gtx 1060. Also destructible enviornments? Oh yeaaaa. Nothing beats bringing a building down when your opponent is hiding behind it.","Jul 24, 2018 at 11:41 PM",5, 13,So awesome to turn more people into mech pilots!

2022-05-28 17:27:08.167043,jmalmsten,It's a nice looking menu... is that it?,"I'll be honest. The menu system is neat. Selling the scale of the giant robots in the background. but other than navigating menus. Am I supposed to be able to do something more? I don't know people to do a private match with. And when I try the death-match I get to the point of selecting 2v2 or 1v1... but I cannot get any further. I try flopping my hands at the two options. It sounds like it recognises the intersection between the hands and the button but nothing happens. I try grabbing it... (feels unnatural for a menu, but maybe that's just me and it does work for other buttons) Hand becomes a fist and it sounds like something was selected but nothing else happens. I try fondling them. I try stroking them. Punching. Slapping. One at a time and both at once... nothing seems to do anything. 

So... yes... for a free demo it was a nice looking menu. I'm not a fan of the slideshow tutorial (I prefer jumping into the game engine and trying it out using the guide to tell me what does what) but that's probably a matter of taste. 

But I was kind of expecting to be able to jump into the mech and at least look around from the cockpit? At least something other than the, admittedly, neat menu...

2022-05-28 17:27:11.266752,NerderThings1,Wow.,"Just played it for the first time in PVP.  I was in a giant mech, and the target reticles moved with my touch remote.  We were leaping around over buildings in one leap and firing while mid leap.  Awesome experience.
The only complaint I'd have is the steep system reqs.  Even with graphics turned all the way down, was a little choppy.
I encourage the developer to come up with more game modes (both COOP and PVP).  This game has super potential and has restored my faith in VR.","Jul 18, 2018 at 7:17 AM",5, 8,

Game is solid. controls are good and action fun.

2022-05-28 17:27:14.391395,HaraKiN,Great game / Poor matchmaking,The gameplay is a solid 4 out of 5 and when the teams are even it's a really fun game (and FREE!). The problem is the matchmaking and I guess it being free is part of the problem. You get alot of ppl leaving after they have died once since I'm guessing they are just testing it out. That gets kind of frustrating after a few times since it often takes quite a while to get matched up with another player. If matchmaking is improved I'll give it the 4 stars.,"Jul 22, 2018 at 8:25 PM",3, 2,

Developer has responded so I'm going to  give them the benefit of the doubt and up my rating to 3 stars, re-install it, and try it again later (I was sure I picked the option to play without guests).
Update: No ability to play 1v1 to test it? Rating back down to 1
Update 2: Dev reckons 1v1 is playabla so I will re-install it yet again to try but TBH  it seemed to imply that 4 was the minimum no to play a private game (and no way I'm going to sign up to yet another forum to seek help)","Jul 24, 2018 at 4:04 AM",1, 3,"You may have clicked the button to open the game to others.
