2022-05-28 14:01:13.015193,DeathTempler,"Good, But Not As You Think It Is.","I finished this game 4 years ago and came back to give input on my thoughts then and now. 
In 2017 I was itching for a Metro/Stalker experience in VR. Seeing this was being made by the creators of Metro with the ""world building and immersion 4A is known for"" I had high hopes. 
It ended up being a Time Crisis game in a creepy-ish setting. Not anything close to what I hoped. 
Nevertheless, it was a good game and I enjoyed it start to finish. 

Now in 2021, I still had an itch to play VR Metro. A couple days ago I played a game called ""Into The Radius"" which is literally VR Stalker. That game is what I'd hoped this would be(and marketing kinda lead on Metro fans with Arktika 1). 

If you're looking for VR Metro, this game isn't even close. Play Radius.
If you are a Time Crisis fan and want to support 4A, you'll enjoy this. 

I do hope 4A and Dimitri decide to create a proper VR Metro installment that plays like Into The Radius. Something with a top notch story and atmosphere we're used to. I want to experience Metro with my bare hands, outside of Airsoft apocalypse RP events. 

Arktika 1. is more of an experiment. Forgettable story, teleporting instead of locomotion, enemies who still sound like Suzaku. I've easily spent most the time in the range playing about with what were a lot of very fun gun types. 

It's a fun gimmicky game that'll kill a few hours. Not much replayability.",Sep 10 at 6:00 AM,4, 28,
2022-05-28 14:01:13.031150,crazyhorseVR,Missed oportunity,"This game have big potencial, but there is som technical problem with gun triggers on quest 2(I have quest 2 and most of people complaining about this issue also but Im not sure if it is just quest 2 problem) It just dont fire properly, it fires sometimes, sometimes late, sometimes it just dont fire at all. This game is about shooting, thats basicaly only thing you do. So bug like this practycaly ruins whole game, I honestly dont get why somebody dont patch it asap. It is some small errorr somwhere which ruins game done by many people for thousands of hours. But…

Or you can look on this like it is part of the story of this game as I do. You are a soldier in postapocaliptic city build on remains of easten europe civilization( Im from Czech btw)….so off course all weapons they give you for work are s**ty, and nothing work properly. Your weapons are jaming all the time, every second bullet is filled with clay instead of gunpowder and some guns just shoot only in thursday….why not. It dont make playing it fun. But it is ****ing realistic !",Oct 28 at 6:34 AM,3, 2,

I replaced my Rift with a new Quest 2. it is mental to think someone is going to repurchase your app for a newer hardware, but same system (Facebook). I refuse to purchase it again due to newer version of the quest 2 I have. I would like my purchase moved to my lol same Facebook account under my quest 2.

2022-05-28 14:01:16.193267,astro_zombie,Absolutely DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,The game looks like it would be so good and perhaps it is if it would just launch.  I’ve had this game for several months and I thought if I tweaked a few things I could get it going but no.  I lost interest and didn’t return this expensive game so I’ll take that responsibility.  Oculus should take junk off their store I trust they have games that actually work. BEWARE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!  Just don’t do it.  I’ve messaged oculus and the Dev and get nonsense answers that don’t help the situation.  If you want to give people in the Ukraine your money for nothing than buy it or just flush your money down the toilet.,Oct 25 at 5:59 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 14:01:16.207230,G4mb10r,No Motion Sickness,"It's so great to find an action packed game that doesn't cause a bunch of motion sickness. The teleport to fixed locations thing is definitely a dated style, but it's a great option for vr newbies with sensitive stomachs.  The graphics in this game are great and the feel of the guns is fantastic. The story is fine, nothing amazing, but not terrible. A great vr fps for vr newbies.","May 12, 2021 at 9:30 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 14:01:16.222190,Aqokka,Early pre-pre-pre alpha of a cool game.,"Arktika.1 is based on an interesting idea for a VR FPS. It has no form of artificial locomotion so you're forced to physically dodge in and out of cover. This makes for intense viscerally exciting gunfights, and makes the game feel like an extended lightgun shooter ala Time Crisis. 

Unfortunately it's just not even close to being finished. They got as far as getting a theoretical game beginning to end and then just dumped it on the store. The enemies do almost no damage and the AI simply cannot handle you using the teleport system to jump from one cover point to another. You can get an absolutely basic challenge out of it if you set the difficulty to hard (once you even find it, the difficulty settings are buried deep) and then never once upgrade your guns. 

Worse still there's no way to center your playspace. The devs forcibly disabled the Oculus menu so there's absolutely no way to change it. If your playspace is 10x10m or above you're probably fine but if not it will probably just dump critical items outside of your defined play area making progression literally impossible.

It had potential, but the game isn't ready for testing, let alone release.","May 13, 2021 at 12:39 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 14:01:16.237150,Bummser,Good game amazing graphics - buggy w/ Q2,"The game looks outstanding, even compared to HL Alyx. I am extremely impressed by the graphics, expecialy with the dynamic lights and shadows. The Athmosphere is dense and there are quite a few Horror elements.

But there is a small bug on Quest 2 that makes the gun triggers not work right. They are just not firing at times as others have also noticed. Not good in a shooting game.",Sep 27 at 5:32 AM,4, 1,

2022-05-28 14:01:19.352718,xman7,So glad I purchased this game,"Con: the opening scene have you riding in some sort of Jeep. It feels weird because you you're actually standing. I wish the price was lower I would have purchased it sooner.

Pro: the gameplay the graphics the movement system, the graphics , fun and scary fun, the attention to detail,  and finally the graphics. 

Excellent game. FYI, I play it using the rift. I don't like to use the quest headset to play Rift games.  But that is another story.","Apr 29, 2021 at 6:09 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:01:19.367678,Xzeptie,Does not work properly on Quest 2,"Does not work at all with VD. With a link cable guns wont fire every time you pull the trigger and instead only fire at random times, its really frustrating.

From what i can tell the game tries to use the secondary graphics which being the intel built in one is poor instead of using my Nvidia dedicated graphics. I have tried to force it to use the Nvidia but it just won't work. In summary if you plan on buying it be prepared not to actually play it!!!!!!!!!,"Feb 26, 2021 at 7:06 AM",1, 6,

2022-05-28 14:01:22.517364,diomark,Plays just fine in Virtual Desktop,"I've seen a few reviews lately that it doens't play on oculuslink or virtual desktop. Can't comment on Oculus LInk, but it plays just fine in virtual desktop for me. Might be because I'm using revive to pull my oculus games into steamvr. Google it.

4 stars because a game with just teleportation for controls is a bit annoying in 2020.. but then again this is an older game.","Nov 12, 2020 at 2:39 AM",4, 13,

Cons: Last, the english voice actor for the woman has all the warmth of a potato in a Siberian winter. I know what she is, but her monotone disconnected delivery lessens the impact of the story. She should be the emotional element that ties it together. Instead she comes across as two dimensional and constantly reminds me that it's just a game, not an adventure.","May 21, 2020 at 6:59 AM",4, 29,

Using a 2.0 cable causes of audio and visual stuttering. Oculus should have just included a 3.0 cable in the box. The actual game itself is awesome, amazing graphics and gameplay, but it's not great when it stutters and I've only had one play session where both the game and audio were fine. I'm using the included charging cable as I'm waiting on my USB 3 cable to come in.","Jun 17, 2020 at 3:40 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 14:01:25.651570,PapiGeerick,Great game to start VR games,"+ Good Graphics
+ Lots of weapons and a bunch of attachements
+ Lots of levels
+ Shooting mechanics are correct
+ If you like Time Crisis this is your style of game
+ Even though it's only teleportation to specifique areas it's well done
+ Did not make me dizzy at any time
+ Surroundings are destructable, it's nice, more inmersion

- Not stream/recording friendly( Twitch, Youtube, Facebook ), shame. I wanted to stream it on Twitch but the game messed up OBS Streamlabs and it was impossible
- Even though I said teleportation was done in a nice way I got used to game with locomotion and free movement.
- Short length. I have finished in 7 hours. But it would have taken me longer if I did all the achievements and difficulties. 
- Very easy puzzles. Even in some moments when you need to unlock a panel you can just reach with you hand, go though and flip the lever.... without figuring out the code. So it kinda kills it.
- Once you bought some guns and upgrade you can easily finish the game, without a sweat. Obviously increasing the difficulty can make it harder, but still... Just spray and pray.
- Repetitive enemies and their shouts.... are... not very threatning... 

So, this is a great game if you want to start playing VR, lots of action, guns, basic VR mechanics. You can interact with a bunch of things in your base, but once you are in a mission you can only interact with what's necessary, shame. 
I think it's a little bit expensive for what it is, but when the game came out it was clearly one of the best games out there and buying it was a good idea to help devs and prove to support VR. So bravo to them!

I recommend this game? Yes I do, I still had fun. But don't buy it for it's full price. At the time it made sense, but now with all the games that are out there it is outpriced. 

Enjoy ^^","Mar 26, 2020 at 5:43 PM",4, 29,

2022-05-28 14:01:25.714402,Velocirapture,What can I say? AMAZING! SEQUEL PLEASE!!,"My favorite VR game of all. Including the Vader Immortal. Why?  It just rocks. The atmosphere, the guns, some of the dark rooms scared the crap out of me. I would  make only a couple of changes.  Let me look around the environments as a bonus after completing them. Maybe open of the teleporting to spots to admire different views there. Other than that, I would LOVE a sequel to this game! Thank you!


***CRITICAL UPDATE!!!***

I got the Oculus 2 and had literally put off finishing this game because I knew it would look so much better on the new headset (and it DOES). But it is seriously broken to the point of almost unplayable. For some reason the trigger pulls are lagging or skipped entirely. Like bang...bang.......bang.............bang bang...........bang.....bang.....  You get the pic.  I imagine it just needs an update of some sort. This being my favorite VR game, I would kindly BEG you to please fix it!  Thank you!","Nov 14, 2020 at 11:25 AM",5, 12,

One time my save file was completely gone.   The other time it was there but I couldn't continue on because an objective wasn't completed in the first mission.  But I've already unlocked Mission 2 & 3 along with upgrading my weapons.  So there is no way I wouldn't of finished mission 1 to move on, impossible.  So now I have to play mission one again and see what happens.  How does the save file get corrupted like this?

A few years later with improved GPUs and HMDs this game is starting to look really nice. I personally do not have a problem with node based shooting when it involves cover because you tend to duck and cover more instead of just strafing back and forth like on a pancake screen.  This is probably a great game for newcomers and or people that do not have their legs in VR.  7.7 out of 10. Good. Rift S,"Dec 16, 2019 at 9:44 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 14:01:35.102637,Nagorak,Ruined By Node Teleport,"Arktika.1 is a bit of an unfortunate game. The graphics are good, although the scale of the hands and weapons seem a bit off. The setting has potential, although it isn't really explored to the full extent that it could be. There is the seed of a good game here.

Unfortunately, whatever potential the game had is ruined by two serious mistakes. First of all, the node teleport system in this game is absolutely horrid. It doesn't feel like you are moving through the level, as much as jumping disjointedly around it.

You jump too far with each teleport and often change the direction you're facing (thanks original Rift front facing setup!). This makes it very difficult to even keep your sense of orientation. To me it felt like I was jumping around from one scene to the next, with no real sense of tbe environment I was moving through, or how it was put together.

Combat is ruined by the node teleport, too. You just hop around from one place to another, while the enemies run around in circles trying to keep up with you. On the one hand it feels overpowered, on the other hand totally lame. Sorry, but this teleport method was just a bad idea all around.

The second problem is the weapon balance is terrible. Some weapons, like the laser, are laughably overpowered. Just upgrade the laser and the whole game becomes a total joke, even on hard. Other weapons, like the plasma bolt gun and the ""shotgun"", are totally worthless. They are simply weak and ineffective to use-worse than the starting gun.

Also, it seems the mercenary you play is either too poor, or too stupid to carry a flashlight on his belt. Totally contrived.

Overall, the best thing that can be said about Arktika.1 is that someone had to make this mistake, so no one else would. It's just too bad, because the game had a seed of potential, it just needed more polish and a less stupid locomotion mechanic.

As it stands, there are much better VR games available now. Save yourself the grief and just skip this early title.","Aug 1, 2019 at 8:49 PM",2, 36,

2022-05-28 14:01:35.154499,WakiPaki,Gameplay and hardware issues,"For one, the teleport nodes are terrribly finicky and when I'm desperately trying to avoid a missile to the face I'd love it if the teleport nodes were A) Plainly visible at all times and B) actually let you teleport over quickly. I kept getting shot becuase I was flailing pointing at a teleport spot and smashing A to no avail.
Minor thing is story is quite weak. Go to these places and shoot the bandits/yagas. Rinse and repeat. Let me explore this place I'm living and working in all the time. Meet people. Talk. Go to a shop rather than an automated weapon armory in an elevator.
Final problem is I bought this about a week or two prior to this review, played it and it was fine. Now? It's broken.
It's like I'm in sticky sludge or something and I'll explain what I mean by that; I pull the trigger while holding a gun, nothing happens. I hold it down, and a second later it fires. This wasn't happening before. I try to pick up a gun from the armory countertop. I can't, I phaze right through. So I let go of my controller and let my in-game hand relax, then go to grab it. I hold grip over it for a second and my fingers slowly close until it grabs. Then this gun also won't fire unless I hold the trigger down. I'm talking all weapons, not the charge up ones.
Since Oculus doesn't have a clear forum for community help or support page for their games like some other digitial game distributors with communities I could mention, and the website for this game lacks a support page as well, I'm forced to leave my technical errors in a review. Ace design there, Oculus.
Had I not had a problem like this game breaking one, I'd rate it a 3.5 at best since it is pretty and fun to shoot stuff, but boring in gameplay otherwise and dead story.","Aug 28, 2019 at 10:14 PM",2, 5,

There are some small to medium size glitches but still the gameplay is pretty smoooth. I had occasional tracking issues on Rift S, none on CV1. Overall, this game is very enjoyable, gives you a decent workout, and is probably one of my favorite titles for my Rift / Rift S. 

A huge plus for me, as a native Russian speaker, was being able to play the game in Russian. Not with just some Russian subtitles or crappy voice overs, but with excellent Russian speaking voice actors. There are a couple of entertaining things you will find in the game (name on ID card that you discover) :-).

I had fun rolling the window up and down through the snowy weather as the vehicle passed by guards and structures. I was excited. Then I stepped out of the vehicle, and the game prompted me to teleport. I gently removed my headset, placed it nicely on the counter, took an unnecessarily large shot of rum at 10AM or so, and dreamed of a time when developers would no longer use the pathetic crutch of teleportation and snap turning to overcome their design shortcomings.

2022-05-28 14:01:41.449898,aWaRLoCK,June 2019 patch - now playable,"UPDATE:
After the most recent Oculus patch in late June 2019, now I am finally able to get the game to run.  There is still an error that pops up on my desktop but after I acknowledge the error message, I am able to play the game and I was able to play the 1st mission and beyond with no trouble.  I did have a blast finally.  Changing score from (1) Star to (4) Stars even though I was never contacted by anyone meaning Devs, etc. for support.

I am using a brand new Alienware Area-51 computer. Also using the brand new Rift-S. The beginning of the game looks fantastic with no problems.  I go through the shooting training, everything is fine, but as soon as I take the elevator for the 1st mission, things go to hell.  The first time, the game crashed my computer to the point I had to reboot it.  I have tried again several times to use the elevator for the 1st mission and every time I arrive in the garage, my VR hands have dropped about 2 ft. down from where they are supposed to be and even though I can rotate them, I can not raise or lower them.  Even if I finally am able to exit the game, in the Oculus menu, my VR hands are way below the menu bar so I literally have to force quit the Oculus program and reboot my computer to get everything working again.  All other VR games, (30)+ do not have this problem.  I thought I would go to the Dev's website listed for support.  It doesn't work.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it.  Looks like it could be a great game but at this point I can't muster anything but (1) star.","Jul 3, 2019 at 7:06 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 14:01:41.465856,kekosalt1,Great fun! Disregard the haters.,"Arktika is a blast, especially if you have a beefy system that can supersample at 1.6+. 

Teleportation: I am sympathetic with those that dislike it. In Robo Recall teleportation can be justified because you are basically a superman, a ""recaller"". We can imagine the recaller to have certain teleportative abilities as part of his job and skill set. In Arktika this isn't the case. The teleportation is a crutch. It takes away from truly appreciating the beautiful sets 4AGames has created. You are zooming through shining, devastated vistas much too fast. TP also makes the game easier than it should be, even on hard settings. That said, you get past the small disappointment with teleportation after your first mission. You just don't care about it anymore. The game is too fun to let this mechanic ruin it. 

Scaling: People complaining about scaling must have man-baby hands. You are in the arctic cold. You would have to wear huge gloves (hockey gloves?) to resist that cold. I like the fact that your hands actually look and feel like real-sized human hands in weather proof gloves. Your enemies are big; decked out in heavy, cold-insulated armor. The games developers are Ukrainian! Have you seen some of those dudes? They're big dudes! :) Victoria is a life sized android. She's hot. I have a bit of a crush on her. Why? Because she's a six foot goddess. I'll take that kind of scaling. 

Gameplay: Fast, fun, creepy, furious at times. Still a bit too easy. Needs a few more enemies in the big set pieces. Gun choice is great, but the upgrades are a bit too powerful. If you don't spend any money after your first mission, you can buy the Ikari and upgrade it completely before the beginning of the THIRD mission and have the most powerful tool in the game. 
Tip: For an amazing experience, open your  real windows/let the cold in. Blast a house fan at you. Get COLD. Get air moving around. Wear light clothes. SHIVER! Best sense experience ever. Also, ""yell"". And see your breath in game.","Nov 22, 2018 at 11:01 AM",5, 99,

I tried to play the game twice, but I couldn't get through even the tutorial/introduction before it would break. First, one of the weapons despawned in the tutorial so I couldn't complete it. Then, I finally beat the tutorial, only for the elevator to break (it was ""off"", instead of going to the floor it was intended to go to, it would be off by quite a bit, for instance when I went to the top floor it went completely through the ceiling and out of the map). The game is gorgeous. The map is very detailed. However, the lip-syncing with the characters is ridiculous, and looks terrible. These issues are extremely frustrating, I just want to enjoy the game but it won't even let me before it breaks.

2022-05-28 14:01:47.806675,taquitobuddy,The most conflicted review ever,"Finished playing through the entire game, and of all the VR games I've played (which is nearly all of them), this one is probably the hardest to review because of the gigantic, almost impossibly huge gap between the pros and the cons.  Going from bad to great:

-Extremely easy, even on the hard setting.  If you use the laser-style gun + enemy outline attachment and shield which are all easy to get, the game offers absolutely 0 challenge.
-Extremely limited enemy variety.  3 ""bosses"" none of which are particularly good or interesting fights.
-The gameplay/missions as a whole are easy, simplistic, just generally boring.  No replayability, no challenge.
-The movement system is horrible.  No free movement, and not even free teleport.  You can only move to predefined positions, and only at predefined times.  The worst part is you can't fully appreciate the environments (see below for why this is a CRIME AGAINST GAMERS)
+/- The narrative/story is decent if predictable and cliche, definately not great, but not terrible.
+/- The weapon variety is quite good and diverse, but one gun/mod is so much better that all the rest are completely pointless unless you are trying to artificially challenge yourself.
+++ The graphics and set/environment designs.  Oh. My. God.  You have never seen anything like this in any VR game.  Stuff like Lone Echo might be a high school intro to MS Paint project compared to this.  This would be a 1-star game for sure, but just because of the graphics this gets a recommend from me.  The jaw-dropping beauty of this art and attention to detail makes the huge shortcomings of the rest of this game even worse, because if the entire game was up to the quality set by the art and environment design, this would be Game of the Decade, no contest.  I truly hope some better studio, working on a better game, plays Arktika.1 and sees the talent of the people who made the graphics so they can hire them.","Apr 18, 2019 at 8:20 PM",3, 20,

Graphics are great, the gun and handling is great and the levels are awesome.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the AI movement, some of the sound effects/audio is bad,   Even though the game is short, I think it's worth the purchase just for the experience.

- Setting was amazing, but story felt generic. The Big Bad Boss was predictable and boring.
- I wanted to see more colonists to get more invested!

The only downside with the game is that you are gonna  need enough room space to hide behind covers at your disposal (and not hitting  a wall or you desk when you are looking for a safe spot and more simple, an interrupter out of reach is quite annoying, cause when it'is beyond your gardian how are  you supposed to go on ?  it seems the game doesn't  allow you to recenter just like anyother title by pressing a button on your oculus touch controller and resetting the view)  and the game became so fun playing like this. Teleportation has never been a problem for me in games, so no complain about  that. I encounter a bug in the armory that prevented me to continue the game, the  already modified gun didn't want to be set in the gun configurator printer and I had to quit the game ( hope  I won't have any more glitches !)

2022-05-28 14:02:00.501210,Metamorpho,An honest review,"First all the bits you want to know: I did enjoy the game. It played for long enough to call it worth the money. Outstanding job by the modeler on those terrific scenes! And good use of the many ways to use my hands to work controls.   I really got a kick out of all those fantastic Guns to buy in the armory. They were realistic and ultramodern. The progression through the scenery was consistent and very cool to go through. So it was worth the bucks. So now the developers side of me to kick in. Go hire yourselves professional voice actors, and hire a real writer for the talking bits. No emotion in her voice, and bad acting in the motion capture made me want to ignore her. Go play lone echo for some incredible voice acting. Also invest in some IK programming and stop using canned animation for the npc's. Although you did a capable job on the bad guys (all four of them) in this day and age. Some interactive responsiveness to my actions would have boosted up the excitement. There are a few bits in there, yes. If it had that and I saw the npc's were actually smart and could pin me down ad bum rush me, it would have replayablility. Also the game wasn't balanced, as I could too quickly buy weapons and armor to make myself impervious. The crazy visual teleport was a bad idea. Although I understand why you did it. I would have been scared out of my mind to actually walk through the scenery instead of zapping to point to point. Most of all the triple AAA scenery's lost it's immmersion by NOT being able to travel point to point under my own power. This is only constructive critism not a put down. I await another one from you but with true AI driven IK based NPC's. Not much of a fan of puzzles, but at least you kept them down to a minimum. Also a few bugs where I would finish off a room. And It would not advance. Or I couldn't grab the gun from my shoulder. All solvable by restarting the scene. But was annoying. But with all that in mind.

The graphics were great although I couldn't turn them all the way up. I liked the different guns and upgrades and attachments. That was a nice touch. The levels were pretty lengthy and it was a solid mix of shoot-em-up style game play mixed with some puzzle solving/environment manipulation.

This game also has some pretty innovative ideas and setpieces, and it works especially well in a room-scale environment.  This is a node-based game as others have described it, which works because the cover and gunplay are done well.  The problem with this game is that it is very buggy.  Guns can disappear during gameplay without returning unless you start over, and nodes sometimes just disappear, including nodes that are required for the story to continue.  On top of this, I experienced a hard crash at the end of the last level, which meant that I had to play that level over.  Fortunately the last level is pretty fun, but it was still pretty annoying.  I'm genuinely pretty surprised at how many bugs I encountered over the course of playing the game.  I've had to start many missions over because of these bugs.

The problem is that there is NO movment - teleport to a pre-aranged spot shoot - go to next spot shoot and thats it. I was warned when i baught this that it was port only but its still kinda lame - there is no excuse for not being able to move were i want. It was kind fun for a short while and then it got kinda boring. The interaction with objects in the world was kinda cool but at the end of the day its a paint by numbers game.

2022-05-28 14:02:16.350049,lewst28,Fun and intense. Dead&Buried overload,"One of the most intense game I've ever played in VR.  Let me start with what I love about the game, it's very immersive, you have to duck, crouch literally in real life to duck behind some of the cover, you could also interact with the environment such as opening car doors for more protection etc.  The puzzles are good and not difficult, it's impossible to get stuck if you just look around, pretty simple.  The environment in game is beautiful and very immersive, really well done here.  There's also plenty of weapons to try and customize including perks and challenges which is a plus.  If you're a fan of Dead and buried, you'll love this game.  This game brings it to another level.

Some people do not like the teleport movement, but I thought it makes sense and suits the plot of the game.  It's also a good introduction for players new to VR or those prone to motion sickness, this game has none of it.  The game is pretty scary though in some parts, just a warning for those not a fan of it.

This game is close second behind Lone echo in my opinion.  Form your own opinion, play the game yourself instead of jumping on the hate bandwagon.  It's just unfortunate that I let myself be influenced by those reviews and waited this long to try the game.  Overall I love this game, it's unique, fun, immersive and very intense.","Jun 16, 2018 at 5:01 AM",5, 5,

Robo Recall and Onward have taught us how good firing a gun can feel in VR. For me this just feels disconnected from reality, ""crisp"" isn't a word I could use to describe the mechanics.

Moving is also terrible. You can only port to pre-determined locations and it's frustrating when you want to be able to control how offensive or defensive you want to be. I can't work with this movement system coming from games like the aforementioned Robo Recall who handle it in a simple yet completely satisfying way that makes you feel like you're in control.

Comfort level was good because I played a lot of RoboRecall and the teleporting wasn't much of a bother. For all that, +3 stars. The yagas are scary and Viktoria's hot, +1 star. 

What would've gotten it a perfect 5 stars = If there was an option to auto-parkour to a different location or get there by an auto-shooting wrist grapple rather than teleport...AND if Viktoria actually played some potent combat support and jumped in the action with you rather than just park herself in her little command station.","May 29, 2018 at 11:48 AM",4, 1,

For  those complaining about game being way to blurred just didn't use their little fingers to type in Google rather to complain in reviews to find a way to fix as they are posts found for some solution to disable ingame fxaa (2017 post found here after 10 seconds of Googling). Sad for people having high-ends system and having issues, might be using a setting that gives them problems, i dunno, but in this game and Lone Echo as lots of people with high-ends systems have massive problems even in medium settings, with my old rig i play in almost maxed settigns with no issues. Go figure. As for the theleport, it's different, i love it, not normal VR teleport but teleport that gives you to plan you actions, reminds me some sorta Metal Gear game style or a game i played on PS4 that you had to find proper position hidding which looked like this, i like it, oposite to some people that like to pay $50 for 4  different games but love them all 4 too look a like and uses the same style, when i pay money for different games i love when some try new approach new style to explore, this system makes it change the old boring FPS with moving around and sprinting. Hurray for Inovation. Love the dual wield and different gun reloading as per RL, not all guns reload the same. As for those who said this game is repetitive and a few lines after they say they like Robot Recall better, well dunno but on my side after an hour of play and a few missions, nothing is more repetitive than Robot Recall. So as for new commers that reads review before buying the game, remember, you can turn FXAA off and get sharp image as i do, just Goggle, be wiser than those giving bad review cuz they can't use their common sens. ;)","May 20, 2018 at 1:54 PM",5, 5,

Ok imagine playing dead and burried where your cover is constantly breaking down.  Except now your cover lasts forever and you can teleport back and forth to certain places of cover.  Some good, some not.   THrow in some intense scenes where monsters are comming at you from ALL angles in dark places.  Then through in the Reward/Upgrade Scheme.  The acting is pretty Cliche'.. but the environments.. boy the guys put some work on this.  THere are some scenes that simply look real.. like you feel like you really are there.  More a since of Awe , unless its the Cannabals comming to eat you.   The interaction with the envrionment is really lacking.. even though they put a lot work on getting certain physics down (like touching a bottle on the desk and it tipping over based on your force of touch).  Another thing.. the people are HUGE.. your hands are HUGE.. the lady talking to you  is an AMAZON..  All in the all the game is a 4 stars.  THe reason its not Five is because of the node based travel.  THe world is cool and atmosphere is interesting.. why stop us from just checking it out?  You could allow free rain  even if it just some limited teleportation spots like in Arizona Sunshine.  Then add in some secret power ups.. like in Dead Space.  Make us upgrade based on what we find.. not on Rewards.  (THats just a thought).  Lastly.. Add in some Melee and  you have a 5 star triple A gold mine.  Oh yeah .. Ditch the attractive chick to guide you along..I don't think sex appeal lures you in as much as Personality.  This game has Dead Space in VR in gleaming lights.  One awesome perk is using the cover.. would have been better if you could teleport like in Robo Recall where it slows down.. but then when you teleport , you can highlight the places where you can post for cover.

I went back and forth with oculus support for a few weeks and gave up. I bought it in a bundle, so no chance of a refund. Be wary with purchasing this game.

UPDATE: Whatever the issue was, it has been fixed at some point in time. As far as I've played at this point, all of the shooter aspects of the game are great. good gesture recognition with the exception of your revolver whhich has a tendancy to flip open.
However, the puzzles intersperced through the game aren't the greatest, and really work against immersion.","Nov 26, 2018 at 3:16 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 14:02:38.547867,Vantablack_,Totaly boring,"Okay after I completed the story I had to change my review from 2 stars to 1.
This game is not worth its money even if you get it on sale. The story is pretty boring and the gameplay is horrible. You have 2 different guns and they both have different reloading mechanics and different amount of ammo, which makes it very confusing to use them. The enemies are weak, you basicly just wait till they leaver there cover and then shoot them. The whole gameplay is very repetitive, shoot enmies, open a door (mostly the same way) and then shoot enemies again. Sometimes there are little puzzles too solve, which can be intersting, but mostly annoying. 
There are only like 2 boss fights, which are too easy, espacialy the last boss fight was extrem disapointing.
The graphics on medium are just bad, everything is blurry and you have to go near to something to read it. 
The map design is the only good thing in the game, because they look pretty cool, but that does not make the game better. 
I do not understand why people think this game is good, they probably never played good games like Robot Recall or Serious Sam.
This game is a waste of money and time.","Apr 29, 2018 at 4:52 PM",1, 3,

Then I upgraded to the Oculus Core 2.0 beta and it disappeared! Can't be arsed to write another big roundup especially as there are thousands of reviews now and it's not needed, but had to show my support for this game. It feckin rocks! Teleportation system actually works really well, always transporting you to the optimum location. Some might prefer joystick locomation but the payoff is much richer environments to interact with. Instead of sliding around sterile corridors, strafing left and right to avoid bullets like in Raw Data for example, this game has you diving underneath cars, crouching behind walls, hiding in skips with retractable sides you can raise and lower for cover. In other words, it feels more virtually real, which is what you want in virtual reality. Combat usually involves being teleported into a scene where you are attacked by a succession of enemies. You need to quickly work out where the threats are coming from and what your best source of cover is. Playing on hard I was literally curled up on my floor at times, pinned down by enemy fire behind a tiny metal railing, and then popping up to rain death on them as they were trying to reload. Needs to be played on hardest setting to appreciate fully, with at least three sensors and rift headset cable extensions so that you have true roomscale and can reallly move around and interact with the excellent environment. 10/10 game for me.","Jan 30, 2018 at 11:17 PM",5, 8,

Someone said this wasn't a simple wave shooter, I don't know what he has been playing his whole life but this IS one of those wave shooters!


If you shoot guns in two hands you just turning your wrists and holster any gun wildly because you can't coordinate the movement properly when one gun is empty and the other not wether to bring that hand to the hip or reload on the wrist movement.
Not fond of the warp system that leaves out certain spots that you can't return to from the new positition and the whole thing actually with this warping is even worse than what we usually have with warping to any spot.

2022-05-28 14:02:41.732009,dougb1103,Good but the mechanics kill it for me,"So, I typically don't write reviews. I personally feel that one individuals opinion cannot necessarily encapsulate anothers. However, in this case, I do want to tell others what this game is/isn't.

First, graphics and audio are first-rate, AAA VR quality. Visually, it's great, perhaps being one of the best visual VR games.
However, as others have mentioned, it's annoying to just teleport to a predetermined area. I get it. That's the design and works well for most firefights. However, the designer in this case remove the freedom of being in VR by doing so. If you've played Wilson's Heart, you'll know what I'm referring to. Personally, I believe that the devs should allow the users to select the choice of movement. This principle alone removes a star in rating.
The other aspect that is a negative is that you can't save anywhere. You need to complete an entire section before the auto-save occurs. Someimes that can be at great length. To restart back at the begining because I had another immediate obligation outside of the game is poor. It's a simple shooter at heart, every level. Why would you need to keep replaying levels? Maybe to extended the game length? I'm unsure of the logic here.
So, it is a good game, it has a good story, but you really need to be aware of two things prior to going in, as stated above. If you're good with that, then it's a good VR shooter.","Dec 4, 2017 at 5:08 AM",3, 16,

The teleportation system works like a charm and I don't think I would have it any other way to be honest. I think it would trigger, no pun intended again, my motion sickness if it were free movement as the action is quite frantic.

I have had no scaling problems. The only problem I have had is my play space isn't that big so have had to recentre myself on occasion to reach items...but it's no deal breaker.

Everything about this game is top notch...so far. Runs smooth as silk too.

I have rated the game purely on its merits and not on my room space or potato others seem to be playing this title on. Don't rate the game down when the problems are of your own making!

2022-05-28 14:02:44.897112,D-Fens,Good game marred by repetition and bugs,"I really enjoyed this game. Guns feel powerful and the shooting is really well done. You have to physically duck/dodge behind cover (at preset positions which you teleport to) and can sometimes manipulate your surroundings for extra cover. The game was also decent length compared to most VR games I have played. However it does get repetitive as the gameplay is really quite shallow. But the gunplay is fun enough to keep you going. There are some puzzles which give you a breather from the combat, some of these are ok but sometimes they are just repeated as well or are just a chore to get past. The difficulty could be harder, although I did die a handful of times. The game was also quite buggy, I especially found it difficult to unholster my guns at times. A patch last week seems to have fixed some of these bugs, but for me specifically it seems to have introduced one where after about 20 minutes I got random blackouts of the display for a second or two. I can't be certain whether it's due to the game or new nvidia drivers which came around the same time, however it only seems to happen on this game. But I managed to finish the game anyway. I don't see myself going back to replay it because it really was quite repetitive, and also I think most of the guns and attachments were kinda meh, and I ended up using the default two pistols with only the laser and torch attachments throughout the whole game. Good game but nowhere near as good as Robo Recall. But worth playing still as it has quite different gameplay.","Jan 24, 2018 at 7:24 AM",3, 3,

Good story, fun gameplay, easy controllers use, it's an A+ game all the way, a must have at any price.

Few issues or missing features:
- Left gun often end up behind my head instead of shoulder
- Game keeps track of only results for one player
- No way to reset the game to defaults and wipe all results
- By the time you figure out the challenges it's too late to do some since you have modified your weapons already and can't remove the IR.
- I had a couple crashes in intense fights on Allienware 1080 so you need a strong gamer PC
- The game is way too easy even in difficult setting, the puzzles are too easy too.

But as far as a casual (on medium difficulty setting) wave shooter with great graphics, great sounds and great atmosphere goes, it's a hit. I think my main complaint would be that I would prefer if the guns just appeared in your hands when you need them (with no need to go fetch them back each time, or the need to keep gripping them when you use them), and simply disappear when you don't need them. As for the annoying reload mechanics of some weapons, you just need to choose the weapons that suit you so that's not a problem.

Things I liked:
 - Guns. Guns in this game are fun to use, they look good (futuristic look) and are in sufficient variety. Many have secondary fire mode that's activated by holding the fire button. There are also a lot of mods for your weapons.
- Environment. Aesthetics and atmosphere are all great. You are mostly in frozen ruins with pretty good lighting. Everything just feels so... right. The ambient sounds and stuff is also solid.

Things I did not like:
- Gameplay. Ok let's start with the meat of the game and that is gameplay. Gameplay felt ok. That's it. Not bad, not horrible, not good or not great. Just ok. Main reason for this is very static combat and that's because you can only teleport to certain locations. You can duck or lean to avoid fire or teleport to other location but it all feels so restrictive. You cannot progress until you kill everything. Combat is for the most part just shooting galeries that you teleport to (except few bossfight). Only thing that save the gameplay are fun to use guns.
- No exploration. You cannot actively explore the level. You are very restricted where you can teleport to. And since levels are so very nice looking and there is all this clutter everywhere it just begs to be explored. That is not allowed for the most part.
- Enemy variety. It's bad. Three types of dudes with guns, one drone type (I think) and one monster type. There are also bosses but also only a few.
- Bug. I played it on launch and there were a couple of bugs that made me restart the level that I was 20 min in. 2 times. Also other mini bugs here and there. Probably patched already but still worth a mention.

Story was average for my tastes. Nothing to write home about.

It got so bad that my VR just turned black for 1-3 seconds while it was loading and I started to feel quite sick. 
This game uses a forced teleport locomotion which I don’t like, you have absolutely no ability to explore your environment. It feels like those old arcade shooters where you’re basically on a rail and you’re just there for the ride shooting anything that pops up. While the graphics are amazing, a good game is not built on graphics alone and while I couldn’t play very much due to getting sick, so far this game didn’t seem to have anything else good going for it.

Having played and liked very much the METRO games, I was kind of looking forward to this Arktika. I finally bought it on offer, paid 15 euros for it. The game really resembles (because of the position forced teleporting) Time Crisis in an arcade game or something slightly different. You teleport to the next position, you shoot, teleport again, interact with a screen, teleport again, shoot again. It is very repetitive and there are very few different type of enemies. The weapons are well built and a bit different from each other but nothing special. Sometimes some parts can be very immersive but this is constatly broken with the teleporting system they adopted, which makes you skip entire areas....Graphics are beautiful but this is not a big VR title, everything else is kind of MEH. Once you see the first chapter you've seen everything. Going back I don't think I would spend 15 euros for it, I would rather have got another game instead.","Dec 26, 2017 at 1:32 AM",2, 0,

The Game was designed around teleporting mechanic, whicht limits the possibilities, but they really tried to find some fun interactions besides the shooting. As an Artist myself I loved all highly detailed weapon designs/effects and they all felt really destinct. The Upgrade/Attachement Systems are quite good and change the way you play. 
Had some technical hickups(Threadripper 1950x, 1080Ti), but could fix most of them by changing Threadripper to gaming mode. (whicht disables half of the 16 cores)

2022-05-28 14:03:07.124784,Liquid_Shadow,Fun with some bugs.,"FUN... when it works. It's a visually appealing game with a lot of shooting and action. The game uses a limited teleportation system with specific positions which limits the game in some ways but still gives you an authentic VR experience. Thankfully, the teleport system places you behind over where it's bloody fun to peek around one side of the barrier and take out a few baddies then pop out on the other side to finish up. You also earn different powers such as slow time and bubble shield like Halo to enhances your feeling of badassness. In spite of the fun, there are critical bugs that prohibit progression of the game while on a mission but it's been happening less and less. One example, I switched out the fuses for a door, which I have done before and know how to do, and nothing would happen. I would be stuck and have to start all over. This is very frustrating when you invest 30 minutes in to the game. Why not implement a checkpoint system within a mission to revert back to? If there is one I didn't see it. Also, I feel like there were a lot of wasted opportunities and space where there could have been more action or jump scares. In conclusion, it's a good experience. And your partner is hot.","Dec 14, 2017 at 7:39 AM",4, 4,

Outside of moving within your room-scale settings, your only mode of movement is that of teleportation.  Teleportation works okay for this game, but I really would've like full locomotion up to the point where you engage the enemy (and then teleportation is fine). The fixed-point teleportation worked well for me in that it taught me how to more effectively use cover around me, compared to running around in full locomotion acting like a partial bullet sponge because I lack the common sense to take cover at times.

You can't explore the enviroment which stinks because it looks great! The weapon selection is fun and interesting although I have heard others have finished it easily with the default weapons.

About teleportation: i dont understand the hate people express towards mechanics like these. I dont get motion sick and enjoy locomotion games like the Serious Sam Remakes, Compound (check this marvel out, its even free!!), Onward and the like.

But true VR should not rely on locomotion, it reduces the games to a standart FPS with a fancy display. In Artica, you dont have to worry about your playspace and real world position. You can immerse youself in the gameworld. Node teleportation works especially well because you will always be positioned perfectly and can make use of cover, play the game with your body instead of your thumbstick. If done right, teleportation can work very well, like in other gems like Superhot and RoboRecall. People who are sceptical about teleportation should definitly try this game. It may not be VRs final answer to virtual movement, but for the time being its not that bad people sometimes make it.","Oct 13, 2017 at 10:55 PM",5, 10,

However, there are glaring issues that need to be solved. Firstly the world scale is incorrect, some items seem too small, others too large. I believe they are using assets from a traditional game that doesn't translate well to VR because some assets aren't scaled correctly. The avatars hands are too big and cups too small for example.
The floor height is wrong as its about 6 inches too low and as someone else mentioned this is probably a `bodge` in order to correct for bad world scale as if the floor was the correct height, the female NPC would be a foot or more taller than me at 6ft, which is obviously ridiculous.

The audio is stereo and not positional- why? Oculus has an audio SDK, there should be no reason why I can only hear a gun being put behind my head in only one earpiece at a time- thats stereo and this is VR- not acceptable.

This needs to be addressed either with a world scale option or something else- really this should not have pass Oculus `Quality Control` to be released with such a major flaw.","Oct 15, 2017 at 12:11 AM",2, 5,

1. Game crashes: I only came across these two or three times, but it always happened at nearly the end of a level. The game has plenty of checkpoints throughout a level, so if you die you don't go too far back. If the game completely closes, though, you have to start the level completely over; therefore, if the game crashes, you lose all progress on a level, even though it had been saving.
2. Character speech: The antagonists often continued to speak even after being killed.
3. A little over-scaled: This didn't bother me too much, but it was enough to be noticed.
4. Buggy teleportation: Moving in this game is pre-set. Too often, it would end up either teleporting me to somewhere I didn't intend to go or just not teleport me at all.

BUT as a handicapped guy would it be to much to ask for an option that allows for sitting play so often the  handicapped are overlooked on some of the best games i always find a way to make it work but it sure would be nice if i didnt have to make it work.... Surely there must be some way to add an option to help those of us who have no choice but to sit in a wheelchair from being 4 feet beneath say the vehicles windshield in the games intro. Other than that i absolutely love this game i would give it 5 stars easily but because of the lack of handicapped access i have to rate it at 4. I hope a developer see's this and takes this to heart and maybe to heart in future games.,"Oct 24, 2017 at 2:47 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 14:03:32.553102,SupaSpud,Not bad. But a few problems.,"So first off, story seems good and promises to be quite interesting. A lot of effort has been put in, clearly. However, it does have problems which need to be fixed, some of them already mentioned. Scale seems off, minor but noticible. Objects and enemies at distance seem really blurry and hard to see, not very pleasant. I'm shooting at nondescript blobs half the time and i'm on high settings. I haven't thought that on any other game so far so not sure whats happening there. Not a fan of the fixed teleport at all; free teleport seems to keep the immersion way better for me. If we're on rails, just own it and drag us where we're needed. Looking at immersion-breaking humming orbs just to move in the only place you can move to seems... unnecessary. But worst off, the game crashes randomly for me 15-20 minutes in at different places. There's no save or checkpoints when that happens and I've had to start level one over from the beginning 4 times... :( I'll wait for a patch on this before I carry on. I really want to love this game, so i'll wait for her to mature a little...","Oct 11, 2017 at 4:59 PM",3, 5,

It has create atmosphere and the weapon system looks interesting. You need to earn money to buy new weapons. There a create diversity of weapons with all kind of add-ons to make it even more compelling. The game only has a teleportation system, but it really fits well to the gameplay. You have to take out enemies from all kind of cover situations and use your 'real' body to move in or out cover. Gameplay wise its robo recall on steroids! I definitely recommend it if you like shooters. I give it 4 stars because Lone Echo is for me still the best vr game, but this is a close second place!","Oct 11, 2017 at 3:31 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 14:03:38.911817,Zeeflyboy,Good but not perfect,"I'm going to assume that you are already probably aware that the locomotion in this game is teleport only (although you are free to move around within the confines of your room space from any given teleport location of course), and either you are okay with that or you aren't.

Personally I did't mind the teleport mechanic - when you get into the flow it feels fairly natural and easy to use and it's still a dynamic game with crouching behind cover, leaning out etc... The game is completely built around this mechanic so I certainly wouldn't hope for any mods in future to change it to free locomotion, you just need to accept it for what it is.

So, what is it - in a word, pretty fun. Certainly one of the better VR experiences I've had outside of driving/flying games... it's fairly easy and you don't often feel like you are in mortal danger, though it is worth noting that  the game defaults to easy (and a lower gfx setting for that matter) so consider changing that around. Moments involving the yagas can be genuiniely creepy and sometimes it's a relief to get back to shooting the significantly less threatening human opponents.

The guns are mostly fun and are satisfyingly visceral... I love the setup for adding/removing attachments. I do wish that you could buy more than one of the same gun to allow you to dual wield with the same weapon. Different reload mechanics in each hand can sometimes get a bit tedious...

Definitely worth a punt at what I think is a fair enough price for a good 4-5 hours of entertainment from a single play through. It's a good solid piece of light entertainment that won't challenge your brain too much with the simple puzzles and can be played in relatively short bite sized chunks as time allows - it would be nice however if they allowed a save game option so you could pick up where you left off on a given mission if you need to stop playing.","Oct 18, 2017 at 11:29 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 14:03:38.968665,blackeye634,Good but not great,"I Have to admit I was really looking forward to this game having enjoyed the metro series. That said initially I was a little disappointed, although I couldn't tell you why exactly. Now having completed it I can say this.

I did come to enjoy it the more I played it, hence the completion. I know teleportation upsets some but I understand why they use it to avoid motion sickness for the masses.

I encountered some bugs, like right touch controller freezing but reaching over my shoulder to get gun always fixed it. The other bug I suffered was a game crash caused by reaching for gun as i teleported which happened once.

Overall graphics were good but the physics were off, as others have mentioned. Some have noted the big hands, but as it is meant to be cold and the gloves are padded, the issue was minor to me.

To conclude, a good but not great game and not as long as I would have liked. I'm still to play a VR game that feels as large and complete as none VR.","Oct 18, 2017 at 4:51 AM",5, 3,

When I finally did get around to buying it, I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the game. The intro story, while having depth, was offset greatly by the fact that you're standing next to a 7-foot tall (must be) woman and you have ape hands. All throughout the game, it seems the scaling is off. It seems the producers went for a ""scary"" game instead of actually building a game with proper content. The only reason I give this game 2 stars is because the sight picture actually represents where the bullet will go. Otherwise, it's a waste of $30.

2022-05-28 14:03:51.612377,TheDevNull,Great Duck and Cover Shooter,"Having an absolute blast with this game. Everyone was fairly vocal about the node based movement system but after playing the first mission I'm sold (it's very well suited for the duck and cover mechanic). 

The use of the revolver (flip to reload) and handgun (drop to belt to reload) during the initial mission had me feeling like a Grammaton Cleric from Equilibrium as I found a rhythm of unloading and reloading while dual wielding.

Graphics are fantastic (bump these to high in the options via the options hud accessed on your right glove). The scale looks slightly enlarged but as you play it will go unnoticed and the atmospher/immersion takes over. The parking garage/underground with cars everywhere was fantastic.

I recommend giving this an honest run (finish the first mission after the tutorial/intro). Worst case you took a gamble and refund it under 2 hours of play. Most realistic case, you enjoy yourself!","Oct 11, 2017 at 12:22 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:03:51.631326,sebrk,A few issues but overall great!,"Well. The game crashes on me all the time. I can never finish the third mission. The game is really great story wise. Probably the best out there. Physics are comical. Pure and simple. One could say that a tripple-A studio would achieve better physics implementation but oh well. You cannot have everything friends, right? Still worth it.

Second review: OK the patch seems to have solved a few issues which is great. Apart from that the game has definitely grown on me. The scale is still a bit off and the rendering resolution is still subsampled. On the positive the storytelling is actually quite good and I am now recommending the game anyway. It is possible to fix the subsampling with a few file edits.

First review:
I was really looking forward to Arktika.1. Having played 2 hours I'm just blown away by the low quality production level the game hosts.
Physics is super weird. Try juggling or let a glass fall holding it horizontally. Like a seconds delay letting it go and it falls on its end automatically (not following any law of physics known to man). Low resolution textures (even on high). Weird UX all over. Unfinished animations. Sound is horrible (seems like it uses one channel/player for all enemies. Whenever one enemy says something and someone else is already talking it abruptly cuts off.)
Everything looks big, fat and squeezed. I've run into 2 game stopping bugs already (yes you need to restart the game/mission). Stupid AI. Subtitles does not work.

I'm sort of amazed that this is something Oculus Studio QA gives a pass to. Especially considering Robo Recall or Lone Echo and other very high production titles that hit lately. I'm equally surprised so many of you gives the game a 5-star review tbh. Finally I'm blown away by ""official"" reviews to give it such high praise. It seems very biased.","Nov 4, 2017 at 6:14 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 14:04:01.193615,zoram,not AAA yet,"Good game, but still I feel like they allowed themselves to publish with issues nobody would accept in a ""screen"" game:
- There is a story ? I forgot, just plain boring
- so you're hired as a Merc to defend some settlement, but the only NPC is an android and the bad guy ?
- scaling ! I found a ping pong racket. The ball coming with it has the size of a bowling ball. Humans are two bigs, the vehicle is too big. You can't touch the floor, you're overing above it. Good thing there isn't a need to pick up anything
- Why does the game start on easy by default ? even on normal, it takes efforts to die.
- no assault weapons ?
- too easy, get the laser pointer and the weapons that shoots around corner, and no point even using covers.

I get VR games don't have the budget of mass audience screen games, but how expensive would it be to write an engaging story, design more than one NPC so that you don't feel like you're defending an empty settlement (which feels pointless) and fix the scaling ?

But already I've run into some pretty significant bugs. I've had the game completely crash twice, resetting any progress in that mission (the first time was right at the end of the first 'boss', so that was a pain). In my most recent play session, the gesture sensing wasn't working properly which made interacting with the various buttons and controls around the place more difficult(it was definitely the game because the Oculus settings menu thing was still registering it perfectly).

If you're willing to look past the bugs, it's a fairly standard cover shooter but designed from the ground up for VR (quite successfully in my opinion). The production quality is relatively high. I have almost no clue what the plot is - I clearly haven't found it engaging but ymmv.","Oct 22, 2017 at 5:53 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 14:04:04.396203,beyondinfinity,Flawed Potential,"I really expected to love this game, but from the get go I was disappointed.

Graphics: The use of subsampling at Medium and especially High settings is unacceptable, it completely breaks any possible immersion (and enjoyment, personally) because of the blurriness. I would prefer 100% render resolution with less graphical details; I hope you eventually provide better graphics options. Apart from the graphics, the scaling of everything feels wrong.

Interface: I found the right hand menu awkward to use as a right hander. It would have be better if we had the option to choose the dominant hand which changes the placement of the menu. Also, why are the weapons only on the shoulders? I personally find it clunky and it confounds me why the standard waist holsters aren't used.

Give us more options.

EDIT: Forgot to add, why do we have to hold the grip button to hold a weapon? I'm already holding the controller which is enough. The grip button should be a toggle.","Oct 17, 2017 at 11:17 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 14:04:07.558891,KhanCity,"Awesome Arcade Shooter, but....","Single arcade shooter at its best: stunning visuals, atmosphere, and environments (extreme setting); fast paced gameplay; straight forward story and puzzle progression; authentic feel of weaponry, upgrades, and attachments; solid acting and character presentation.  The game felt right, it felt natural to hold and use weapons. Likewise, interaction with the environment came as a second nature with enough room scale accessibility, of course.  Great use of a cover system and cover switching via node placement around the perimeter.  Don't know why people complain about scaling issues, when in comparison, everything else is bigger than normal.  Now, to the cons and why I took away a star.  This would not come as a surprise, but I would have liked an option for free locomotion.  I know the game wasn't designed for it from ground up and I understand why, but leaving such beautiful environments mostly untouched is little disappointing.  Second, there are few glitches when it came to puzzle solving and progression.  For example, during the Cargo stage mission, I had to move a container inside the unit B3 I believe.  While doing so, I had to use a crane to place it on the right train car in order to move it forward.  So I placed a container a little too close to me instead of placing it on the end of a train car.  I thought that I can just use the crane to adjust the placement but no luck, crane would not latch to the container no matter how many times and positions I tried.  So I had to finally restart the level in order to move forward.  I'm sure these bugs could be worked out in the near future and developer probably looking into it as we speak.  In conclusion, this is a definite buy for any VR shooter junkie out there. Arktika.1 is a title that makes you invest in VR gaming.  This game should set a standard for production value so I don't have to expect anything less from other experienced developers moving forward.","Oct 17, 2017 at 6:58 PM",4, 1,

While you do that you get exposition read to you via mic essentially removing a lot of the discovery from whats going on.

The combat its self is fun- but really it's held back by the teleporting to only pre-defined locations. 

The game just simply holds you hand way to much through everything but shooting bad guys (which can be fun) and solving a puzzle to get through the door infront of you.

I wanted to enjoy this game but it just feels loose overall. 4A's metro games were fantastic- tight linear levels with interesting gameplay mechanics. This game just holds your hand and tells you everything as you go.","Oct 15, 2017 at 4:57 AM",3, 0,

As far as the game itself, I was disappointed when I found out it had teleportation instead of free movement, but I was wrong about that. Once I played the game and gave it a try, the teleportation system is really integral to the game and provides a lot of play opportunities you wouldn't have with just regular movement. It's almost like a dash skill. You can rapid fire teleport from vantage point to vantage point and it's really a lot of fun.

I don't really care for wave shooters, so this is really my favorite so far. Graphics and sounds are beautiful and the controls are perfect. I even think you could play this sitting down if you don't mind not being able to duck under low cover (which hasn't been necessary yet since I just pop into a space, shoot my target and move on).

If they fix it i will definitely change this to 5 STARS!!  First minor thing is in the control room i find that when you close the window the scenery disappears in the background before the window completely shuts...totally ruined the coolness of it.  Second there should be a few more teleport spots in the control room so i can move to where the girl is or to window so i can look outside the scenery.  Third when you take and place objects they dont make any noise...that really ruins the immersion!!  Forth when the girl speaks on the intercom, dont completely shut out the background noise, its another immersion killer!!  There are probably more little things but all in all pretty good game.","Oct 11, 2017 at 6:18 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 14:04:52.113070,ShurikMur,,"One of a few true AAA for VR by the end of 2017.
Speaking formal - it is ""just another VR shooting gallery"". Yet it made carefully and well polished in terms of gameplay, it does have plot and several hours of gameplay, it has additional progression by managing weapong and upgrades for them, so at the end it feels very solid and valuable.

Teleportation is implemented in a smart way - every point in meaningful and you can navigate very fast whiting combat. The downside - lack of any exploration, the game is completely linear.
Shooting is also implemented properly: bullets flies at finite speed - not slow, but just to make player notice trajectory and adjust aiming. There are a lot of targets to test the gun in an armory. Every successfull hit gives solid feedback. Reloading is fun and simple, the game not bother you with fiddling reloading and counting every bullet - you can't drop all magazines to the floor and get eaten by zombies :)

But there is some odd issues about performance. Maybe it is just because of my way to play the game, but on GTX1060 it runs not very smooth, there are short freezes and sudden frame drops. And the settings of visuals seems to have no effect on it. Yes, 1060 is not most powerfull video, but it is from recommended system specs!","Dec 27, 2017 at 4:28 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 14:05:30.336928,FreelanceMC,"It's great, but it's not amazing.","Arktika.1 is fantastic at moments but it's dragged down by wonky physics, a strange over-all scale, and the same cheap tactic to lengthen game time by revisiting maps you've already visited ( like robo-recall). Now I can't comment on the performance, I am using Revive (I'll be honest) and I think it would be unfair to judge the optimization. I still recommend the game, it's a joy to play and smells of AAA quality, but it falls flat in some crucial areas.  It's however half the price of a full release AAA and VR, go for it. 4/5","Nov 4, 2017 at 8:28 AM",4, 5,

Sent the ticket few days ago and no response from developers. Not working and cannot get support, so 1 star. Would give 0 if possible. I've had not single problem with another titles (tried and own 10-15). Not recommended.","Oct 15, 2017 at 12:07 AM",1, 2,

I'm not having these bugs that others are speaking about and the game is very enjoyable. Would be nice to move freely but it feels more like a Time Crisis game. Nowing this, I enjoyed it very much.","Oct 28, 2017 at 1:32 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:05:30.398763,Gasolio,,"This is easily one of my all time favorite gaming experiences. The immersion is insane, no watching videos does it justice until your in it. It's why I built this insane rig (i7 4790k, gtx 1080ti oc) to play this kind of AAA VR game. I really like the teleport system in this game it just sets you up in interesting positions and the areas you end up in are scaled to your playable room area. 
Really cool game. One other thing is if you ever want to take VR like this to a whole new level take a look at the Subpac m2. You dont realize whats missing until you try it. You feel everything and it just takes the immersion level to a whole different level.","Oct 12, 2017 at 1:46 PM",5, 1,
