BUT.,"This has always been one of my VR staples. it was so immersive playing through the campaign when I was new to vr, and i absolutely love the time slowing mayhem john wicking these B****** into oblivion. It was incredibly jarring and exciting to jump off a roof and die for my ethernet overlords the first time and maybe the second and third times i and my friends played the story. but now, after years of no significant gameplay updates(that i have hoped deep down for), this game has toddler-proofed, removing any scenes of ""self-harm"". I have had 2 people very dear to me commit suicide, and i have never been offended by the harsh reality of this game. it was flavor, it was shocking and jarring, but it made it feel alive, ironically. since i have owned the game the devs have never expanded the content of this game beyond minor bugfixes or an event here and there but here they are, retconning what made it so captivating in the first place. i am very disappointed that i can no longer enjoy this games mindf*** campaign as it should be experienced",Sep 17 at 2:41 PM,4, 74,

I hadn't even heard of the debacle prior to writing this review, and I am LIVID. I guess even though I own the game, I will have to find a version with everything I paid for included. It's not enough to give me a toggle option, but it has to be REMOVED completely. 

Shame on the developers for doing this. I regret ever giving them money. I used this game to introduce so many people into VR, and pretty much all the memorable scenes are now removed.

BUT BEFORE you made this stupid move some people had saved the previous version  , so you are f*****.

Go to the folder where the executable is installed ( usually ""your drive path"" \ oculus apps\ ) ,then go the folder named ""Manifests"" edit these two files : ""superhot-superhot.json""and""superhot-superhot.json.mini"" , change the two values in the bottom lines named ""version"" and ""versionCode"" from 1.0.20 to 1.0.22.1 and 63 to 65 ; no more unwanted updates !

2022-05-28 12:10:43.137931,bo3b,Game is ruined,"Have to add to the list of negative reviews for removing content with ZERO options to play the original.  I have no problem if the devs felt the need to destroy their own game- but I paid for this, and they ruined it.  No rollback, no beta build, no toggle- no way to get the original game back.   

Removing content with forced updates is absolutely contemptible.  Why not just delete the first 5 rounds while you are at?  Hell, why not just delete it from my library if they are so embarrassed?  They just proved they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, and I have ZERO recourse.

Corporate weasels at their most masterful.  Don't support this anti-consumer, anti-art behavior.

Their tagline specifically says 
BODIES ARE DISPOSABLE
MIND IS SOFTWARE.

2022-05-28 12:10:46.247191,Cruddysafe1,Game was great before censorship,"The latest update has removed pivotal parts of the story where virtual self harm is involved. It is clear by the comments made by the lead dev and CEO that this move is a measly attempt to show ""awareness"" of those struggling with mental health problems, especially those involving self harm. When in reality the omission of the segments of self harm show how little they really care. They only care about making themselves look good and omitting taboo topics such as this and this does just that. I still have yet to hear someone who actually had a problem with these parts of the game prior to the update. The director of the Superhot team is simply projecting his fears and own unhappiness of what may come of the game to the numerous consumers who have supported Superhot over the years. In short, I would not recomend purchasing this game as it is a bland shooter and a victim of censorship.",Jul 24 at 12:21 PM,1, 73,

The game already had an option to disable disturbing parts of the game, but now the devs have completely removed the ""disturbing parts"" .  Personaly I found these parts to be one of the most impactful portions of the story wich I feel really helped prove their catchfrase of ""mind is a software"" and ""bodies are disposible"". I feel that taking these parts out heavly impacted the emotions I felt when playing through the game, and just made the game feel like some silly first person bullet-time game.

2022-05-28 12:10:49.422830,inceptional,One of the best games on Rift--but . . .,"Note: I'm dropping the score for now, until you put back in the ""self harm"" content you removed from [at least] some versions for no genuinely good reason other than it being just one more example of the misguided, ""progressive"", virtue-signalling, ""social""-media-driven, garbage thinking and OTT implusive, reactionary behaviour of our times. 

Fix the game and restore it to how it was previously, and the way they vast majority of players enjoyed exactly as it was, and the score will be increased to 5 stars again.

--------------------------------

It really does make you feel like you're Neo in the Matrix--in all the best possible ways.

I just wish the developer would go in and tweak/fix the throwing aiming, because right now it's not great--it's actually very hard to intuitively throw stuff exactly where you want without having to really take your time and focus on doing it just right--and I've seen multiple games in VR now that simply do it much better and far more naturally and instinctively (Edit: See Half-Life: Alyx as a perfect examle).

To the developer: Seriously, try a few more games that let you throw things, such as Job Simulator and Contractors (just two examples that spring to mind. Edit: And Half-Life: Alyx now too), and figure out how to at least make throwing work as well as it does in those games (as in go in the direction you actually intended without having to overthink or overwork to get it).

Fix the throwing and this would REALLY be right at/near the top of my favourite VR games list--although it already is anyway. :)",Jul 23 at 7:23 AM,1, 20,

I know that I can put anyone I know into this one and nausea is almost entirely non-existent. There's no need to teach people what buttons to push, nor how to play. It's self explanatory and allows people to play at literally whatever pace they feel comfortable, while making them feel like an action star. It's kids friendly (low violence, no blood, and easy to understand.)

If I had any negative comment about it, it would be that if you have a Rift and a Quest/Quest 2, it kind of stinks that there's no cross-buy for this. That said, I don't mind it so much because I'm generally okay with buying it again if the game is good enough, as I like to support quality developers. The blow is lessened a bit by being able to use AirLink, but it would be nice to get the Quest version for taking to friends' houses and stuff for free.

The art style is very unique, with enemies that glow orange against a white background, and shatter like glass when hit. The nickname ""John Wick the game"" is actually quite accurate, as you grab the nearest object to kill one enemy, grab the downed enemy's weapon, rinse and repeat. The scenarios it puts you in are crazy, the weapons are all extremely powerful, and each hit packs a punch. I especially love that the melee attacks end up being just as powerful as some of the guns in the game. This game is an absolute must play for any VR owner.","Apr 26, 2021 at 1:37 PM",5, 16,

The game is not very long, only 19 levels and after finishing the game you can do speed runs and arcade mode which isn't something I'm interested in, so the replay value isn't there for me.

My only complaint is that the game is lackluster in terms on levels, weapons compared to the original version on PC, in that game you have much more interested levels to play with, more weapons which overall makes you feel even more awesome eventhough your not really performing the actions yourself.","Feb 18, 2021 at 8:21 AM",4, 44,

So I got SUPERHOT VR, I was excited to play, and completed the game on the first run. I let some of my family play.
A few days later I got back on the headset and started playing SUPERHOT VR, but it won't launch. It took 10 minutes before I gave up and took the headset off, looked at my monitor, and it was black, SUPERHOT VR just won't load. This has put me off buying any games off the oculus store, and instead buy it off steam.
So if anyone might know how to fix this please let me know.","Jul 31, 2020 at 9:16 AM",2, 19,"Hi!

2022-05-28 12:11:46.209644,Issis74,Good but lacks some essential features,"For the first couple of runs, it is very good, one of the best games. If you get killed in a certain level, you respawn to an earlier level. This is frustrating after the first few runs; there should be an option to respawn at the level you die. If you share the headset, there is no option to start over, they have to start at an advanced level according to the progress of the last user. There should be an option in the beginning to choose the level to start. Also, an option to choose between instant respawn and starting level selection. These lacking options hamper the replayability and that, for me, is minus 2 stars.","Feb 12, 2020 at 8:31 PM",3, 3,

Update: It's not kidding when it says its room scale. I lunged out to disarm an enemy and actually punched my wife.

Edit: Thanks dev, she is okay. I only have about 2 by 3 meters to play in. The nature of the game means it's hard not to reach out of that to grab something.

This was way cooler and more fun than I thought it would be. If you ever wanted to feel like a bad**s in The Matrix, this is the closest you'll get as far as I know.  Extremely satisfying!  The minimalist style of the game's presentation totally works for Super Hot.  Fair warning, you might damage any surrounding furniture nearby.

I couldn't find any settings to change this.

Or you can manually edit files by going into the program and start deleting things and lose all your progress. You could also play the manage files and folders game by backing up each persons data in a different folder and replacing it as each one wants a turn. Fun!.. That is sarcasm.
All of this could have been handled in game menu easily.

But it turns out that was by design. Because they DO have a level and progress menu. But ONLY if you beat the game.
What kind of game logic fallacy is this where you hide user friendly menus behind a progress wall? Who does that?

I guess the type of people who want your money twice, that's who. Because even though the Oculus store allows app crossplay between a Oculus Rift, Oculus S, and Oculus Quest, this developer decided they won't allow it and you get to pay twice or more, for each VR device you own.

Not 1 star because come on, this whole mess gave me a laugh.

2022-05-28 12:12:36.758530,Akemicario,Some UX/Safety issues,"It was a good game and overall I’d recommend it! However there were many times where Superhot places things out of reach. I’m very short, and the in-game headset between missions is difficult to grab for some reason. Many times they’ll place important objects outside of the minimum play space requirement so sometimes the item I need in the moment is through a real-life wall boundary. Sometimes the level design anticipates me being able to reach an enemy but they place them outside of the play space so I can’t. This has caused me to need to play by reaching outside of the play space guardian to progress through the levels and have made me hit monitors accidentally on multiple occasions. These little considerations of the physical accessibility of VR are very important and I was surprised to see how Superhot slips up on them. The game design should be more forgiving for weapons and objects out of a user’s reach as it gives a weird disadvantages that, with creative thinking, don’t have to be there.","Jun 4, 2019 at 12:53 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 12:12:36.776482,ImTylerDurden,"Amazing Game, But Easy to Cheese","At first, I absolutely loved Superhot. And still do. The level of immersion is amazing. There were numerous times where I felt like I could lean on cover in the game only to remember that piece of cover didn’t exist in the real world. 

And no game so far makes you feel more like you are in the Matrix than Superhot. 

I thought the campaign went for a good length, and there are some decent post-game options for continuing to play. 

My only main criticism is that I felt like I broke the game and/or cheated and/or cheesed the game toward later levels. Since time only moves when you move, you’re free to look around and dodge bullets for virtually eternity if you wanted. At a point, I learned it was easiest to play the game safe and slow, which is far less exhilarating. 

Nevertheless, Superhot was a blast and is second only to beat saber as not only a must buy for VR but also the perfect game to introduce people to VR. I can only hope for a sequel or DLC now.","Jun 3, 2019 at 1:55 AM",4, 0,

The description reads, ""Lose track of what's real."" This honestly is what you can expect in this FPS. The mechanics are simple and the gameplay is immersive. You're fighting ""glass"" humanoids who can be shattered with your fists, projectiles, or guns.

The ""gimmick"" of Superhot is that time moves as you move: if you stand still, bullets freeze in mid-air. This twist allows for hours of immersive gameplay where you work out how to out-maneuver your opponents.

I was blown away when I found out this game was originally designed for PC. This game was redesigned so well that it seems like it was made for VR. Every part of this game fits in VR gameplay.

There is a short campaign, but the freeplay is really what you're buying this for. If you're looking for an elaborate storyline, look elsewhere. Think of this as a wave shooter and you'll really enjoy how unique it is.","Aug 27, 2018 at 5:50 AM",5, 34,

2022-05-28 12:13:27.555232,FerolaJ,Great VR Intro that lacks depth,"The heart of this game is it time mechanic.  This is a great idea that is absolutely neutered in the level design.  The almost 100% static positioning (room scale recognition allows minute position changes) and the lightning quick game rounds (each level of the ENTIRE game) ruin an otherwise great experience.  By the time you are having fun bouncing bottles off of enemies and dodging bullets the round is over.   If you just got your VR and are looking for something to jump  into this game is great.  If you've had your VR for a bit of time (like me) you will have more fun fighting in GORN and more fun shooting in Pavlov or Onward.  The game feels like a demo.  I really can't stress enough that you are entirely static when playing and each ""level"" is a very short (sometimes 10 seconds) affair.  If they opened this game up to allow character movement and lengethed the play in each level this could be something really cool.  As it stands nobody really wants to play an ""on-the-rails"" game like this in their VR.  The game is a tease that is fun, but still a tease.

Basically you become Neo from the Matrix, dodging bullets in slow motion and destroying waves of enemies. The gunplay generally feels good, though throwing things takes a little getting used to - it doesn't feel quite true to life, and sometimes things break against things you were certain they hadn't hit. It has an endless mode with a few different rooms, but that's the extent of the replayability.

Very short (took me 58 minutes to beat it)  and it's pretty much a slomo wave shooter.  There is no form of locomotion so you are stuck to your play area.  There are no katanas like in the PC/Console version and not as many levels.  You just stand there, dodging bullets in slow motion, trying to find something to throw at the red guy, or pick up a gun and shoot the red guy,  and everyone ( including yourself) die in one hit.

The game is fun, great for those who get motion sickness, and awesome to show to friends who are new to VR.  Is it the greatest game since ever?  Nope.  I would suggest picking this game up when it is on sale or if it comes with the DLC pack.

2022-05-28 12:13:43.391517,volley.se,,"The best VR game I know of (so far). It's my goto game when showcasing VR to newcomers.

Despite 5 stars, some room for improvement:

Even though this game lets you feel like a mafia thug (guns), a ninja (swords) and Max Payne on steroids (time control), it really should be easier to aim when throwing objects. I consistently aim so badly that it ruins the immersion. Imagine a scene in a ninja movie where two opponents standing a couple of meters apart face off. They both throw a set of five shurikens each, but the spread is so bad that when the scene is over no-one got hit. Except the camera man and the sound boom guys.

Anyway.

I also think I found a way to tell a well designed level from a poorly designed one. With every replay of a well designed level, you tend to feel more and more in control. You start pulling off scenic stunts with dual wield Uzis, you whack enemies two at a time, and you eventually do it all without stopping time. You own the world! But when you replay one of the few less well designed level, these things don't happen. I'm not sure why, but perhaps there's too much randomness going on.

Being forced to replay easy segments over and over just because you make a mistake later on gets annoying really fast. People liken it to a puzzle game where the fun is trying to figure out the solution, but who likes repeating the exact same puzzle over and over? 

Also the game is incredibly short. It took me just about an hour to get through it. People say it is very replayable with the speedrun modes, but I had no desire to go through the same levels again.","Jan 10, 2018 at 6:29 AM",2, 3,

How wrong i was, at this time i should know that watching a gameplay of an VR game has nothing to do with playing that VR game, i should bought this masterpiece long time ago.
It has simplistic graphics ... yes, but when in VR they look more like stilish graphics, the immersion is terrific, all in slowmotion like Matrix bullet time and speeds up when you move, fast action without VR motion sickness, dodging bullets, punching, killing, with a coreography like the movies..... its a must!!!... just look that you have room enough before play.
If you are in doubt becouse of the graphics on gameplay video like me don't hesitate, just go for it, i'll buy it again even at full price. Great work devs!!!.","Dec 10, 2017 at 5:49 AM",5, 7,

It's not just about completing the level, but trying to complete each stage with the most style.  I found myself trying to imagine even more creative ways to down my enemies.  I started off by just trying to beat each stage as quickly as possible, but then figured out that it's just more fun to go for style points.  So don't try to beat the game ... just have fun.

2022-05-28 12:14:18.360291,MoerasGrizzly,The matrix is superhot,"Superhot VR allows you to enter The Matrix. It allows you to be Neo, dodging bullets and punching and shooting faster then humanly possible. On the flipside, it's not too ambitious. There is no locomotion here, no motion-sickness induced by the camera moving when you don't. You stand in a room, dodge bullets, punch those storming towards you and shoot or throw things at people far away, hoping that you can grab their weapons as they fly towards you. It's an exercise (in ultraviolence), as you have to duck and stand up again, move side to side and throw your body into poses to ensure that you aren't shot. There is no motion sickness here: Your virtual body moves along with your body. 

In short, an action game that really takes advantages of VR and steps over it's disadvantages. And, on top of that, it's the best Matrix game, without ever being called that.

The one downside is: As you'll be moving and punching a lot, be aware of your surroundings before you start.","Dec 6, 2017 at 8:42 PM",5, 5,

It’s an awesome game, short as most VR games seem but the replay value is there in timed challenges and simply doing each level again with self imposed restrictions (no gun runs etc) – highly recommended, shows off the sense of power our physical actions have in VR and stands head and shoulders above more expensive games with finer graphics.

2022-05-28 12:15:09.092860,IanTH,A Different Perspective,"If you've played the original, then I think there's a chance you'll be let down by the VR version. It is a completely new game built for VR. A change I was disappointed in is the lack of free movement; sure you can move around your roomscale environment, but you are auto transported to new spots which I found really hurt the experience. Given you move in slow motion, I figured thumbstick/free-locomotion would actually work pretty well in this game. Unfortunately, we don't get to find out. 

Stand in one spot, pull off a handful of moves, then get whisked away to the next scenario. Normally you play a block of about 5 scenarios before you ""checkpoint"". Fail on the 5th, start back on the 1st. It can get repetitive. And if you miss a ranged enemy and have no bullets/items nearby, you have to move your hands or make strange, extraneous movements to speed time along until he gets into melee range. And miss you can, as thrown objects don't seem to follow any sort of repeatable trajectories. Take your time on your aim and throw lightly to help improve your chances of repeatable throws. In what feels like a patchwork solution to the ""distant-enemies-but-no-ammo"" problem, a bit later on in the game you get some glitch-force ability which can explode enemies every 3 in-game seconds which, in execution, ends up feeling less like skill & more like a cheat. 

If all goes right, you can feel kinda cool like in the original. Though unlike the original, it is easier to miss and a bit harder to gracefully recover when you do. And since you can't move outside your Guardian-bubble, once the flow breaks, the feeling of ""cool"" breaks along with it. In the end, it feels like a fairly disjointed experience and a bit meh overall. I don't find it worth the price-tag and it ultimately feels like an average VR experience to me. But I am quite clearly in the minority, just wanted people to take a minute to look into it a bit harder and see if it is truly for them.","Jul 25, 2017 at 5:18 AM",3, 6,

It's a great concept executed well and, though I didn't play the browser version, I have to imagine this is 1000x better than that. I really can't recommend this game enough. THE ONLY CAVEAT is that you definitely need a decent-sized room to play. There are a number of games that warn you that you'll need ""1.5x2m of play area"" or whatever and I've been able to play them without issue. Superhot, on the other hand, has you moving around enough that, despite starting in the middle of my play space, I've so far punched a lamp, a box fan, my chair, my bookshelf, and -- if a whiteboard I moved aside hadn't caught the punch -- would've put my hand through a mirrored closet door. Unlike with, say, Arizona Sunshine (which gives the same warning), Superhot won't allow you to stay in the center of your play area. To pick up or catch certain guns, catch certain objects, punch certain attackers, or grab certain throwable objects, you'll need to move around quite a bit. Be warned. Other than that, though, great game. Well worth the cost and potential hand injury/broken stuff. Plus, if you film you punching a lamp, you'll prob get a ton of hits on YouTube.","Mar 11, 2017 at 12:28 PM",5, 9,

Because time only moves when you do, the gaming mechanic becomes something you physically manipulate with your body. If you're out of shape, you'll feel it when you're done playing.

After you kill them it starts you in another room or area again and it gets harder but there is no story or real progressive game play. Just little battles. After shattering these guys into pieces of glass so many times it gets old fast. It finally set me up in a scenerio that seems unfair and theres no way to restart the game to start fresh.

Think the Matrix meets VR is probably the best way to describe the experience of playing it. Apart from how original the concept is (time moves when you move - it then gets even wierder but I won't post any spoilers) the tracking is so fine tuned it feels your hands are actually there. 

The martial arts is just as great as the gunplay. If this was just a series of challenge rooms i'd still give it 5 stars but the story layered ontop as you begin to explore the world turns this into a truly special experience.

I haven't played the non-VR version of superhot but after beating the game I cant imagine it being played any other way.

With the boss being able to take more hits than the regular henchmen, slow motion matrix fighting would really make it cool! Also I would love to see the ability to watch action replays from the players point of view and a 3rd person view.

SuperHOT makes full use of Touch controls and while very interactive it doesn't induce motion sickness. This game puts you in an environment with objects and enemies that feel close enough to touch. You'll punch, stab and shoot your way to each new level. You'll even gain a ""special"" power along the way. There's great sound and great graphics, all satisfyingly minimalistic. And there are quite a few levels all with different challenges that will give you hours of amazing game play.

The game duration is commensurate with the longevity of the game mechanic; the novelty ran out just as I was finishing the game.

• Unique and interesting visual style
• Controls are easy to learn and use
• Very Fun

Cons:
• Relatively Short (3 or 4 hours)
• Limited Replayability (only story missions)
• Leaves you wanting to do more

While short, it doesn't cost as much as a full game, and there's room to expand in the future if the Devs see fit. So many times while playing I wanted to move further than I could, and while the game accounts for that by letting you reach further than you should in those cases, it ruins some of the immersion (yes, even through the ability to manipulate time).

I wish I could rate this 4.5/5, but reflecting on it, 5 stars is well worth it. This game is an absolute blast, and I will definately throw in anyone who visits to try my Rift+Touch.","Dec 18, 2016 at 4:41 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 12:17:48.526822,DrEiri,Makes me want to play regular SUPERHOT,"I'm not gonna go out of my way to sing this game's praises, instead, I'm gonna focus on the things that stood out to me. Unfortunately, all of them were negative. Maybe it's because I played and thoroughly enjoyed the original SUPERHOT, but I feel the game came very close and just barely missed the mark of the experience I was hyped for when I heard the words ""SUPERHOT VR"". My biggest gripe is that there's no HOTswitching. This mechanic was absolutely one of the things I was most excited about, and I considered it to be an excellent and novel form of locomotion for VR, sadly, it has been replaced by the ability to blow up enemies by pointing your fists at them. I understand why this was added: it was in order to prevent stalemates in the game when the player ran out of weapons with enemies that either would not or could not come closer. That said, I would much rather let myself die to an enemy bullet every once in a while when I ran out, than just drop HOTswitching entirely. And, I mean, it's not like HOTswitching couldn't take on that role, considering it kills the previous body. Second is the lack of replay value, the original SUPERHOT had a series of excellent challenges that seem relatively simple to implement, along with an endless mode where you fought off waves of enemies. This, paired with the inclusion of HOTswitching, would've made an *excellent* game that I would be thrilled to come back to again and again. Sadly, once you've completed the experience, your only reward is a level select. I beat the game in one sitting (or standing, rather), so now all that's left for me is to go through those same motions with no extra challenges. I would've even just appreciated a hard mode or something.

I sincerely hope future updates and DLC add more than just levels, because as it stands, this really just makes me want to play regular old SUPERHOT. I do recommend the game, it's worth the price *for a VR game*, but by regular PC game standards, it's severely lacking.","Dec 17, 2016 at 3:19 PM",4, 1,

SuperHOT VR is definitely the most fun I've had in VR so far. The gameplay of SuperHOT feels like it was made for VR ever since the first installment. Even though the game is really short (1-2 hours), it's pretty good for replayability, and the amount of fun I had in the 2 hours I was playing it has been more fun than most games I've sunk $80 on.

2022-05-28 12:18:04.510249,Zathkar,"Very short, but fun (and frustrating)","First of all, this game is extremely short. It only took me a little over an hour to complete, all in one sitting. There are no alternative modes or challenges or collectables, so you'll have to make up your own reasons to replay it. As such, the price is rather steep for what you get.
The levels seem to build up to something big, but it ends before we get there. A few concepts are teased in some levels, like in-level obstactles that you have to duck under, or moving doors, but these are used once and thrown away.
The game is fun and feels good when things go well, but it's often frustrating when they don't. Use up all of your weapons without killing every enemy and you'll have to wait until one of them decides to come into melee range... eventually. The game's main mechanic-- that time only passes when you are moving-- goes out the window any time you grab something or fire a gun. Doing either causes time to pass at full speed for a moment, meaning the enemies have a chance to fire at you and any bullets that were already in flight will near-instantly reach you. This feels out-of-place and usually leads to cheap deaths.
As-is, it's hard to recommend. That could change if there are (free) content updates in the future.","Dec 13, 2016 at 12:49 PM",3, 1,

You feel superhuman in this game, and that is a great feeling. I'm struggling to comprehend why the devs chose to add a diagonal interference/grain effect to everything - maybe it's an attempt to cover the SDE which would stand out due to the flat, bland graphics, who knows? It's not a major issue in such a clever game, but what with less than great enemy visuals and intentionally tepid backdrops, the blurry filter only adds to the sense that the game as a whole could look quite a bit better. A cleaner, sharper, more polished look, as well as more levels (the game is very short, has little replay value, and is currently not cheap to buy), would make Superhot a 5/5 for me.","Dec 8, 2016 at 9:42 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 12:18:20.377581,barackus,You are in the Matrix,"Wow. This game is intense. The world only moves when you moves, meaning you can dodge bullets, or cut them in half with a knife. Nothing feels better than to blast someone with a shotgun, taking cover (by actually ducking) and grabbing his gun out of the air with your free hand, to finish up who's left. 

If there is a downside, it's that sometimes you're required to punch someone's head off. If you happen to be at the edge of your play area, that means you punch something in real life.

2022-05-28 12:19:59.760120,Vive4Life,Way too short and too easy!,"Very short with a minimal challenge...

~1.5 hours of gameplay with limited replayability, this is because in VR you cannot move other than in your play space, and because the enemies/items are in the same place everytime there are not many ways to do things.

Considering how easy it is for the develepors to make levels for this... it is such a disgrace, and with not even a survival mode... all I can say is ""Shame on you devs!""

Only a couple of parts were challenging, and only the last part of the last level was close to that frantic fast paced never relenting rush that you EXPECT from SuperHot (But I still completed this ""frantic"" part on my first try, I thought ""Okay the game is finally picking up, I guess this was just the tutorial phase""... and then I get hit with the credits...)....

The difficulty with difficulty is because in VR you can precisely move and thus precisely control the flow of time, it is very easy to dodge and do things (unlike in the desktop version), so it would only be hard if enemies were absoloutely swarming you and you had to very carefully plan out your next few moves (I would very much like a ""challenge"" mode that has this).

However the developers realised it would be super easy, and so when you grab/throw an item or when you shoot it makes time run at (maybe) 3/4 speed for (maybe) 0.3 seconds, so when you perform an action get ready for the consequences. However they really could have done with a difficulty slider to alter these variables as it could definitely be more punishing.

If this was released on Steam they could atleast have enabled workshop content.... and if it was made for the Vive they could have had enemies surrounding you as they wouldn't be pandering to the people with front faced tracking only....

Basically do not expect this to be the full SuperHot experience but in VR, because it is not.

And yes, I'm playing this on the Vive (not that it matters).","Dec 27, 2016 at 10:25 AM",2, 4,

2) Wave based/endless mode as the main game is somewhat short (finished in under 2 hours)

3) Method for resetting game progress. It would be able to run through the whole game again without having to choose each level individually
