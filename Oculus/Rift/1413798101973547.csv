Overall though it can be very entertaining to get into but also very frustrating when I have a fully upgraded soldier ( or whatever you would like to call em' ) get 1 hit over and over and the hints are just ""?"" they should point or atleast be able to click and show you where/what they mean. It is enjoyable though, just keep in mind short and in time if you play it enough like me you will notice the unbalance part.","Apr 7, 2018 at 10:49 AM",1, 0,

Can be very challenging if you're trying to get 3 stars on the levels but it's very addictive.  Graphics and animations are all well done.,"Jan 25, 2018 at 1:55 PM",5, 6,
