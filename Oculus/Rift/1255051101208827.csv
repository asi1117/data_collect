2022-05-28 15:21:42.210204,Mogli_,I tried but this is umplayable,"I tried giving this game a chace because the developer appear to really care about it, but I can't allow other people to wate their money with this. there are to many problems. On one of the missions, dying can spawn you on an upper floor while the elevator is on a lower level. the only way to progress is to restart the mission, lose all your progress and try not to die next time. This is not a good/finished game. Sorry","May 25, 2020 at 3:48 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 15:21:42.226162,Dannycopo42,Pretty Good,"The visuals and bow combat are pretty good, it feels nice and smooth and the enemy and world designs are cool. My only frustration with the bow was the fact that swapping arrows was too difficult to do quickly, especially as you can't hold open the shield while swapping arrows! This led to the underuse of an otherwise awesome mechanic. However, the interactivity of the world is pretty good, you can pick up and mess with many objects in the game, including dead robots after you shoot them! It's not HL:A but it definitely added substance to the game. The ending was a bit underwhelming though. Overall, I reccomend if you want a bow combat game with a nice sprinkling of exploration and visuals.","Mar 29, 2020 at 2:11 AM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 15:21:42.241122,SDC-Wutang,Immersive FPS as it should be!,"Everything about this game is what a VR shooter should be in 2019!  Graphically this is the smoothest shooter out there, even with the settings turned all the way up.  With the exception of some of the text, everything else is super crispy with no watery or laggy effects.  The controls are SNAPPY!  And even though there's a bit of a learning curve when it comes to bow handling, once you get it, it's a real joy!  This is what immersion should be: me not having to dink around with settings while achieving maximum quality.  This title has this in spades!

And like other reviewers say, the story is intriguing, with a nice balance of problem solving and action.  I say problem solving because to me they are not exactly puzzles and if you pay attention the answers are given to you, detective style.  Very engaing!

I'm keeping my eye on Fast Travel Games.  They seem to know what they're doing.

2022-05-28 15:21:42.258076,Satconcook,,"Loved the story. Nicely involved puzzle solving leveling shooter game. Once you find all the hidden secrets, the story mode has no real replay value. However, they do have Cygnia Cup which is an arcade style archery range in which you can try and get a higher score.  The story actually took me several hours to complete and longer for the secrets, which were a bit frustrating to locate at times. Especially when you find out that some of them are in the zone, not the actual story point you select, but can only be found in a different story point in that same zone. There were a few bugs, one which prevented my story from progressing till I restarted the game, in which an item I needed was in a room that would not render. You can also teleport to some places that will take you out of the games map, but I found that kind of fun. Having the option to use smooth locomotion is nice, but the fact that you still have to use teleport on ladders and so many other multi level areas really messes with ya. Especially if you just wanted to walk off the ledge down a ladder. 

I see from the replies on other reviews that the developers have taken feedback and I would have to agree with some others, that a save option is highly essential, especially with a family. Logging into a different Windows account just makes it even worse since they are probably watching you and just want to jump in and try it for themselves. I would love to see more of this world, as there is obviously more story to this from all of the terminals and clipboards around. Speaking of clipboards, the text isn’t lined up on some and seems to be floating off the paper.","May 29, 2019 at 12:27 PM",5, 6,Thanks for this detailed review!
2022-05-28 15:21:45.379727,SirCodes,Okay Game but Ridiculous Puzzles + Bugs,"This game is just okay, and I would have probably given it a 4 stars if it was not for the hard puzzles and frequent bugs I encountered. Most of the ""puzzles"" are time-wasting because there is not a good enough hint or direction on what to do or where to go. It is not fun to constantly have to pop in and out of the headset to look up what to do. After mission 10 I just gave up because the game has become so infuriating that I just don't care anymore.","Jun 2, 2019 at 5:11 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:21:45.394687,SilverwolfMD,"A great game, just needs some bugs fixed","At its core, Apex Construct is a solidly written game with a great story and fun challenges.  The bow draw is a little strange (you have to draw the bowstring to your nose instead of your cheek) which helps a novice aim but experienced archers may find this awkward.  (Maybe there can be a setting for this?)

For some people, the vignetting may be a godsend, as I find it reduces motion sickness dramatically. If you don't like it, you can turn it off.

There are some bugs that need fixing.  At times, entire rooms don't render, and this can lead to a couple of problems, as I have encountered at least once in each case...sometimes, it's just the textures that don't render, which means that wireframes and associated collision mapping is still in place.  I have encountered a room in the caves where I seem to be walking and landing teleports on thin air, wondering whether the bots in the room are going to detect me, or whether I can land a shot on them instead of my arrow hitting thin air and alerting them to the noise.  At other times, sometimes the collision systems don't work, and I walk into a partially rendered room, down past a ramp, and realize I've stepped through the floor on which the file cabinets (which have rendered) are resting.

Another bug is in the motion system.  Walking around works at times, but sometimes, often when walking and turning at the same time, the linear motion (left stick) seems to be rotated out of true, so that I end up walking sideways when pushing the stick fowards.  A quick teleport fixes this problem, but it is quite the issue when it occurs in the heat of battle.

Still, the game is great, and I suspect that gameplay will be more challenge against the enemies and less frustration with the glitches once these problems are fixed.","May 19, 2019 at 1:46 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:21:45.409647,SwampFrog,One of the better games on Rift!,"The gameplay is smooth and intuitive, the combat is satisfying, the graphics are artfully done while keeping it low poly.  There is a good amount of content for the price -- I went through the main story in 7-8 hours.  The storytelling is interesting enough if a little generic.  Two questions for the devs: will there be DLC levels coming out?  And why can't the trophies I find in game be used as achievements in Oculus Home?  (I like collecting achievements and I was disappointed that I didn't get to keep those.)","May 19, 2019 at 10:29 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:21:45.424607,Hanover,Buggy. This is Quest Ready?!,"For the first half, this game was pretty cool.  Then you get to a wave-shooter type level.  The way you increase your health is by drinking energy drinks you store in your inventory.  You literally have to pull the can out and drink it.  Good luck actually getting them out as there seems to be a very small sweet spot that is hard to activate so you can ""grab"" the can.  They need a button, like all other shooters, that allows you to use a ""health pack"" without having to go through some motion.

Also, in a later level, I actually had the entire floor of a level disappear.  I have a 2080ti so I know it shouldn't be my graphics card.  Unfortunately I can't see where I'm supposed to teleport because it looks like I'm floating in air.  I had to stop the app and restart it.  

After that, there is an area (subway with crashed subway cars) that you end up respawning into if you get killed by a robot, but the friggen elevator isn't on the floor you respawn on, and pressing the button only opens the door and doesn't call it.  So I had to quit and lose ALL MY PROGRESS because there was no other way down!

Seriously, I don't see how this game is remotely ""Quest Ready.""  It's full of bugs and glitches to the point where I don't even feel like finishing it anymore.  I only have so much time to game, and having to waste time re-playing levels because the game gets into unwinnable states annoying.","May 6, 2019 at 4:29 AM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 15:21:48.626044,VibrationsOfDoom,AWESOME gameplay and story line...,"...Though I question WHY it's effective to shoot a bow and arrow against robots (Okay, yes, they are ENERGY arrows). GREAT voice narration and BEAUTIFUL scenery, and I haven't even gotten through half the game yet! I do find that th ebow and arrow mechanics are not quite as smooth as, say, Keep Defending, but it works well enough that I'm not ""aiming blind."" Or maybe all those Keep Defending sessions trying to shoot enemies from high up while far away has made me a better bowman. Either way, I am loving my few trips through so far... Forgot to see if the save game states work, or are even in place, but I've had fun with what's here so far...

2022-05-28 15:21:51.732735,iFlea,Love it but... my wife was dissapointed.,"Love the game its great. The issue is there is no profiles or saves or any feature that would allow two people to progress through thye story. My wife had to wait for me to finish the story game before she could have a go. I would seriously struggle to name games that do not have profiles or saves. The only reason game would do this is to force people to buy more than one copy, but to force that on a game with no well developed and blooming multiplayer is just d...-move.","Jan 18, 2019 at 4:38 PM",3, 21,"Hi, appreciate your feedback and happy to hear you like the game! Apex Construct was designed for a single player in mind, but the save data is unique for each Windows user so if you wanted to, you could login with a different Windows account and get a unique save file just for you, using the same Oculus account. A bit of a hassle of course, but a workaround if you feel like it:-)"

2022-05-28 15:21:54.887298,Digikid1,Clipping issues like mad,"I like this game except for the issues with the ""clipping"".  This is where items go through the ""level"" never to be seen again.  I got stuck for over two hours because a clipboard that had a VITAL door code had simply went through the geometry of the map and would not respawn.  Other time parts of the level would simply not render and things would be floating in a vast pinkish orange hue and you could not teleport to them.

Also a VIVE controller in the settings instead of a Touch Controller?  Almost made me puke.

Another thing......please put the NAME of the level that you're currently playing in the pause menu so that when you get stuck at least you know where you are.

This game has promise.....however it is still MASSIVELY flawed and IMHO should not have left beta until these issues were looked at and sorted out.","Jan 14, 2019 at 6:55 AM",3, 10,"Thanks for your input, the Vive controller graphics was fixed in the latest patch and we will keep improving the game going forward - the clipping issue you mentioned is one of the things we are working on at the moment, for example."

The atmosphere is strange in a good way with all the weird stuff like traffic signs laying around and comically placed bus stops and smoking areas was really fun. 
The voice acting is great and even though I still don't fully get what the story is about, it still managed to get me engaged. I like the mix of adventure and action...plus the shield bow is really cool!
Thanks to the developers for an awesome experience.","Jan 30, 2019 at 11:08 PM",5, 0,"So happy to hear you loved our game, thanks for letting us know!!!"
2022-05-28 15:21:54.918215,RuneSR2,Great game with a few flaws,"Although textures could benefit from more details, the game looks great. The game does work perfectly using super sampling 2.0 on an oc'ed GTX 1080 (2100 Mhz boost, 11 GHz ram), i7 7700K. Touch controls and full locomotion are supported, and locomotion works great with the new version 1.04 (HMD-directed turning is now possible). It's a fun game and a great story.
One flaw is still present though, maybe more a problem for left-handed persons like me: locomotion movement and weapon hand are locked together, so when I put the bow in my right hand then locomotion is also moved to my right hand and my brain can't figure out how to move ;-) Please don't lock movement and weapon hand to the same controller - fix that, and I'll add that last star, thanks! :-)","Jan 13, 2019 at 7:09 AM",4, 2,"Hi, thanks for your review! We will be looking into the left-handed issue and should hopefully be able to provide an update soon:-)"
2022-05-28 15:21:54.935170,Nameless4Now,Great game made even better...,"Was hoping the Dev's would fix a few of the issues this game had, and I'm happy to say they did!  Much smoother locomotion and world interactions.   The voice acting alone is worth the price, combine that with a very interesting story and great VR immersion and ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!!","Dec 6, 2018 at 3:22 PM",4, 6,"Thank you so much, really happy to hear you enjoy our game! We will continue to improve it going forward:-)"
2022-05-28 15:21:54.951127,lefthome,Great game with some flaws.,"I really enjoyed this game for the most part. It creates an atmosphere, and tells a story within it. The voice acting is good, even though there are only a couple of characters. There is a good mix of exploration and combat. The combat can get quite hectic but you are not generally caught unaware. There are audio/music cues that let you know you are in some trouble. 

As far as flaws, there is some issues with free locomotion where you clip into scenery and the screen goes black. I like the movement options and found myself using both teleportation and free movement throughout the whole game. I played seated and used the default 45 degree turning with the right thumbstick. I wished the controls could be customized entirely (you are limited to swapping hands), but I did get used to them in the end. The 'swap arrow type' button didn't work how I would have liked (back and forth between 2 of your 3 arrows), so I sometimes found myself scrambling mid battle to change to the 3rd arrow. I would have rather it just rotated between all 3 all the time.

My greatest flaw would have to be the ending. It was rather anti-climactic and felt like it left more questions than it answered. I discovered all the notes, logs, diaries, etc. but I still feel kind of let down. I'm not sorry I bought it or played it through, but I felt like they owed me more at the end.

Gorgeous graphics and the sound design is very well done. The enemies are interesting (if a little limited in variety). Overall I would recommend to fans of narrative adventures with light combat. I did find myself returning to one particular level repeatedly, because it was short and profitable and it let me practice my combat. The bow is a lot of fun.

I haven't played the additional 'cup' content that was made available recently, I just finished the game and wanted to write my review based on the story mode.","Nov 14, 2018 at 9:54 AM",4, 18,"Hi, happy to hear you are enjoying our game!

Nothing has broken the game yet, but you get 'stuck' on corners, items fall through tables, tracking will go wonky for a second every once in a while, I'll be unable to pick something up and have to try 3, 4 times until it 'clicks'.

Bugs aside I am havin fun with this title and actually do recommend it. If and when a patch fixes some of these issues (getting stuck while walking is the main problem at least for me) I will update my review.

I am enjoying it thoroughly and think it deserves ~4.5 stars. (Emphasis on being a 'narrative adventure' game. If you want predominantly an action game you'll be disappointed. If you want a crazy hard puzzle game you'll be disappointed. If you love narrative adventure games, it's fantastic.

I gave the game a second chance and played it through. I have to admit when you get used to controls after some time and ignore bugs (some cause a very unfair game) you can have fun. Graphics don't really change during the game, but they are nice made. So i can say - you can give it a try. You can find some videos on youtube, watch them to decide if you give it a try. Give yourself time to get used to it, then it makes fun. But i hope there will be updates to fix bugs and maybe an addon for more and new Levels.","Jun 1, 2018 at 10:08 PM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 15:22:01.246290,Wildt,Quite a disappointment,"I had high hopes after reading so many glowing reviews, but this is fundamentally a mediocre game dragged down by bugs, crashes and most importantly: STUPID design decisions.

2022-05-28 15:22:01.261250,GusmanB,"Good game, some fails","First of all, I love the game, the history is intriguing enough to keep me wanting to know more, the scenarios are beautiful, combat works really well, etc etc.

Said this, the game has some fails, first the controls, they're buggy as hell, free motion works very badly, you can get stuck in a rock, trespass a floor, and sometimes even get blinded because the game thinks you're inside a wall which is not true, this for free motion, teleportation doesn't works totally right also, when you have something in your left hand you can't use it as the raytracer detects the object as an obstacle, sometimes you can't reach open zones because it detects collissions with non-existent objects and so on.
After the controls the other big fail is the positional audio which is totally missplaced, you cn ear an enemy at your side when it's far away in front of you, or throw an explossive arrow to the farthest the bow allows you and ear how it explodes in your face and things like this, in some cases is very irritant as you try t know the enemies' positions by the noise they make and it's worse than going deaf.

But, besides these fails I'm enjoying the game, it's a really good experience and if the dev's fix these fails I will rate it as 5 stars.","Mar 23, 2018 at 11:22 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 15:22:01.277207,CrimsonCatalyst,Wow,"I'm going to give this five stars. The GOOD first! When I first booted up and found myself in the void, and a voice spake unto me. And I was born again through the voices will. Wow was I ever blown away. The whole rest of the story feels very much so like this. Learning about Fathr and Mothr.... All that. Wow. Cool story and atmosphere. Controls are solid. A rehash on the bow fighting that everyone seems to like so much. The world is nicely put together with ceavate. The reasons I could bring this down to four Stars. Bugs. Small bugs. Bugs that dont hinder than gameplay or take away from the story and experience. When walking freely you tend to get hung up on random floors. This is quickly and easily fixed by teleporting. However. There is a switch in my back. A bane to my existance in this game. When typing on a key board.... Your whole hand can push keys. So you might try to type out (dir, then... open filename) but only get as far as ""D I RLKDJB"" because your hand accidently typing somethings in with your palm. Meh. Not a deal breaker. I feel like the game itself shines past these instances. And the otherall takeaway after 5 hours so far, is that I am glad i got to experience this game.","Mar 25, 2018 at 6:36 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:22:01.292167,WoodyUKx,Bit meh really,"From reviews i was expecting a lot more.  Movement feels clunky.  Graphics are rather bland, low texture stuff found in a lot of VR mini games.  Archery and combat mechanics are very good though.  I just got bored with doing the same thing all the time....looking for key/card crack computer for codes etc rinse repeat and environment look very samey sadly.","Apr 22, 2018 at 3:18 AM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 15:22:04.395866,IanTH,"Early Thoughts, Small Issues","The game so far is a pretty decent experience. The bow, for the limited amount of time I've been able to use it, is pretty solid. It requires skill, but no more so than many other archery games. I'm running the game with Ultra graphics & it is an pretty game, though I don't love every aesthetic choice.
------
There are quite a handful of annoyances into my first hour or so of the game. Smooth locomotion turning is done in relation to the controllers & you can't change it to be in relation to the HMD. If no other changes are considered, PLEASE consider adding an option for this.
------
I like the fact you can have smooth & teleport activated, but dislike that TP is mapped a face button on the left controller. I would much prefer to have it on the right as the current config means you can't really mix move & teleport as you'll have to take your thumb off the left stick to press the TP button. So mixing is out - it is one movement option at a time. 
------
Another gripe is how you have to manually type things on the consoles - truly an annoying design choice. I appreciate what they were going for, but it does not outweigh the cons. Sometimes it can guess what you're going for if you fat finger a typed command and misspell it (as you will almost always do), but other times you'll have to try again and hen-peck the words all over again. It kills the flow of the game. I'm now bummed every time I see a terminal, dreading the unavoidable annoyance.
------
Had an issue with figuring out where to go next at one point and had to resort to a walkthrough. I was rather...I guess I'll say ""annoyed"" with the solution, lacking a better term, but at least I can keep playing now.
------
I'll come back & update as I play more, but there is still a lot to like in its current iteration. Given the game started its life out on PSVR, some of these issues aren't exactly a surprise. Hopefully the devs will listen to PCVR feedback & tweak accordingly.","Mar 21, 2018 at 1:49 PM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 15:22:04.411823,evilStimpVR,Very enjoyable bar a few small things,"Very enjoyable and a must-have for anyone's library if you enjoy archery combat. Only a few small niggles are that the keyboard is a bit fiddly to type using the Touch controllers (would be better if you had to press a button on the controller to register a tap on screen, rather than just hover over the keyboard and pray you hit the right key). Also you sometimes end up in the wall so screen goes black. Very small problems, but 99% of the game is great so these will prob be patched later.","Mar 27, 2018 at 12:44 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:22:04.426783,IamNic,Thanks for allowing it for Windows 7,"I had a discussion with one of your developers on Steam a few days ago, where I told him, that Oculus Home doesn't allow games to be installed and played on Windows 7, if you list them as ""Windows 10 only"" on Oculus Home.

Now that you changed it accordingly, I purchased it here.

Thanks again.

It is an awesome game btw.","Mar 28, 2018 at 3:36 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:22:04.442740,Talon1,Another 'Real' Great Game,"This is one of the few full (longer than a tech-demo), honest-to-goodness fantastic VR games out there.  It has a really interesting story, good game mechanics, and an option for teleport or free locomotion.  It's up there with Lone-Echo and Chronos in my book.  THIS is why I bought a Rift, more please!","Mar 30, 2018 at 4:39 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:22:04.457700,RaDrumba,Just beaten the game On Stream,"I feel like the ending wasn't that good after I've beat it. But I've only found 3 of the 5 Hidden Files. But if you don't know how to access the Hidden file you want to do some research. 

I've been looking everywhere for thes hidden files in the game. But if you really wannted to complete this game you gotta do it on your own. Because youtube doesn't halp at all. 

You'll will have to find this stuff on your own. That all I'm saying this game is hard looking for those files.

2022-05-28 15:22:07.566386,siegius,A good game with some fixable problems,"This is overall a good game, the bow is good even though handling feels a bit unnatural. The worst thing was the need to punch in the codes on virtual keyboards. It is a neat idea but the execution was not very nice, especially navigating virtual computer via cmd interface. Other then that a solid product.","Apr 9, 2018 at 12:28 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:22:07.582343,vanfanel,Decent game with a few bugs,"I haven't gotten very far but the world is very nice and so far the gameplay is pretty good.  There are a few issues.  They keyboard input needs work.  There are some buggy areas.  I was able to get above the rocks in the 2nd area and appeared to be outside of the ""game"" based on the graphics.  It was kind of neat but then the teleport wouldn't let me get back down so I had to restart.  There were also some collision issues with items.  Sometimes they'd get stuck inbetween objects when picking them up.","Apr 12, 2018 at 12:36 AM",4, 0,

My Thoughts:
A stellar story and single player experience. We need more games like this in VR
Its hard not to love a title based on one of your favourite genres.
Apex Construct is a cool 'inception' styled single player adventure that's a treat on the eyes and also on the senses.
A lot of love and attention has gone into this game and it shows. It's very polished.","Mar 22, 2018 at 9:16 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 15:22:07.613261,nrosko,will probably refund,"The game essentially does nothing for me, i found it quite tedious. I play about an hour or so but i think its enough for me. 
What is good: 
You have good options ie teleport or free loco, lefty or right.
Decent value, seems like there is a decent anmount of game here for the money. 
visually quite polished.
What i'm not so keen on:
Artistically the enviroments & world felt cartoonish & nothing made me go 'wow' it just isn't my thing at all. Some things look cool but overal i was hoping for more. I like the idea just not the execution. But of course its subjective. 
Audio cuts in & out from room to room & ruins immersion. Sound is actually good apart from that but just seems lazy. 
bow & arrow mechanics are a bit meh, other games do it much better & it appears it is the same weapon throughout.  
You have to interact with computers by typing stuff in & this is also part of how the story is told. Personally i really don't like this sort of thing in games reading a email or journal entry is dull as. Unfortunately you really have to interact with them as its a key part of the game. 
So while i would say its not for me i would recomend you give it a try as you may like it.","Mar 23, 2018 at 2:37 AM",3, 8,
