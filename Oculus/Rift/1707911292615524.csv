2022-05-28 17:01:27.037014,Frosteternal,gorgeous but can’t pick up anything,The interactions after leaving the clothing shop don’t work. Things just float when you grab them.

2022-05-28 17:01:27.066934,Cryptosage,Holloween,"This is something really special.
let me discribe it like this.
Its October , the air is crist outside. im sipping coffee, as I enter the land of COCO VR. the celibration of Holloween , the land of the dead.  Its a place of beaty that cant be discribed by words.
i got myself ready. put on my cloths and entered the Town center. there is Music and laughter , Color and lights the like of which can not be compared to anything. its wonderful.   my most enjoyable time was in the art Gallery . With Coffee in hand. ( in  real life) i spent some time in here looking at the art and just enjoying the atmosphere of it all. 
i love it. im going back in there soon just for the feeling i get while exploring this 
place.

the only con is that i cant actualy pick up the paint brushes or the hats or mustches or other thiungs. please fix the interaction stuff concerning this. i really want to be able to play around with all this. but other than that its a really neat place to be in VR.",Oct 22 at 12:16 PM,5, 10,

2022-05-28 17:01:30.251416,OutOfMercy,Wish there was more,"I played this vr experience recently and was quite immersed, the only down side  to it is the limited things you can do and how close you can get to things, for example the band playing on the stairs  cant get that close unfortunately. The ""cinema"" doesn't let you get too close either  how ever the tram/train experience is amazing, the taking photos and dressing up is cool and being able to take your head off is fun,  I'd love  for there ti be more but for a free  experience its great.","Jan 15, 2021 at 6:09 AM",4, 8,

Works perfectly using Rift CV1 ss 2.0, even with 4xMSAA, but be careful with the dynamic shadows which took me below 90 fps, even disabling antialiasing did not help. I'm using a heavily oc'ed GTX 1080.","Feb 22, 2021 at 6:51 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 17:01:30.295300,Chunchucmil,Fabulous creation! Absolutely immersive!,"For a tag-along free VR vignette based upon a movie, this felt more like a true made-for-VR “experience”. 

The artistry in this creation draws upon a fantastical blend of Spanish colonial, Art Deco, and other-worldly architecture, all with an authentic Mexican flavor. 

The acoustics of alone deserve appreciation, along with the music. The street Cinema was a delightful place to watch a few shorts.

The Museum of Arts (just off the plaza) was so enjoyable and well-designed that I left a little of it unexplored for later.

I spent over an hour just exploring and enjoying the main plaza, and once I found the exit... I immediately wanted to return. In fact, I plan to return many times with my friends to experience this place using the multiplayer option.","Nov 22, 2020 at 2:00 PM",5, 5,

It seems to be based a little on a death cult, what with all the skeletons and other creepy iconography, but I guess that makes us a good app to run around Halloween.

If you talk whilst looking in the mirror the characters mouth moves, it looks like it is doing the taking. Bit clunky getting around, but worth a gander at all the things.

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I wish it'd have been longer and included more of the film characters and scenery. Still, it's well worth the price of admission.

2022-05-28 17:02:01.860873,onceinAwhile,almost great; incomplete though,"I must say that I loved the way this app was made, the atmosphere and there are some genuine moments where you get lost in this world; although is leaving you a bit sour because you can see more potential for it, but it does not get there. I would gladly pay 10 dollars if the app would add more.
The positives: atmospehere for sure; voice acting is nice; and the museum of art is incredible; that is how a VR experience should be. The train ride is outstanding and the plaza environment with the singers is so good that you just sit there and listen them singing. Graphics are very nice and colorful and kids love it.
The negatives: controls are obnoxious; for good time, you won't be able to move around or do what you should do, because the pointers does not register the position. I was about to give up honestly; and there is no feature to play the experience with keyboard or joypad either. Interaction is great, but there is only few things you can do; which is a shame. The movie theater is just a glimpse and can't do much, not immersive; compared to the other activities around. Movement is a problem, since it is the ""timewarp"" mechanic, which is good for people with motion sickness, but give an option for free walking at this point, so people can choose what to use. Also there is not much to do, beside the museum (long experience), train and the movie area.
I hope the devs will expand this and for the future; will give us a paid experience that add a lot of playable elements and value; to have us go back more and more. I can see myself paying for a longer and deeper experience; if it is done at this level, and controls are finally fixed.","Jan 21, 2018 at 4:06 AM",4, 4,

these developers are clearly a cut above so many of the game developers out there. the locations made me feel I was ""there"" more than any other VR app I have played yet.  the sites, the atmosphere, it feels like a world. and one I would love to explore. it made me feel like it was alive with people and not some dead program. looking up and seeing the mountains in the sky and the gondolas really was a nice touch.  downside? same ole same ole. no regular locomotion. and it just ruined it. these developers take the time to create these wonderful immersive worlds...and then...only allow teleporting. see, they shoot for realism in that they want to create worlds for us....but...they fall down just before the finish line. essencially punishing me because some get sick in VR. well I dont. but still I am forced to pop myself places awkwardly. alot of VR makers are starting to get hip and include both movement models,but some still dont. but

Like others mentioned, the train ride was well done, the environment is beautiful, I loved the singing and even the dog movie if you watch the whole thing gave me a laugh. I think the beginning could be better executed when you are in the room and having more of the same in the Plaza could have been skipped. I wish the world was a bit larger, more interactive, more things to see. I wish they could have integrated the real world to the dead world...that bridge...which was a big focus of the movie in the cemetary..well....they should of somehow integrated that with how to get to the other side with a pass showing the family on the other end with your picture..something like that.

The artwork in the Gallery was also cool to see. And the Sky Trolley, that really gave you a depth of the world. As well as, the characters were more richly animated than most games, which you'd expect from Pixar.

The experience can take over a half hour or just a few minutes depending on your playing style, but the breath-taking artwork and focus on culture will have you lingering.

I haven't smiled this much playing a game since I first my Oculus and loaded up First Contact. It's absolutely sublime. Only a short experience, 10 minutes or so but such a massive variety of experiences and emotions felt in such a short time. If this was a full game I think it would be the best game on VR, it's such a quality production. Guess you would expect nothing less from Pixar. This has got me really excited for Fall Out VR. If that can capture half the atmosphere of this charming title and expand it into an entire world it's going to be amazing. I found the teleportation worked really well in this too, and as my preferred way of moving makes me think Fallout might be quite playable in this mode too.

What it lacks is emotions. See, one of the wonders of VR is being able to have my 4 year old watch Allumette or Henry for example and feel overwhelmed with emotions, be it sadness or joy, both stories being told without words from a child who's reactions can't be faked. 

Pixar, of all animation companies, is best at conveying these feelings, oh so many times have I cried or laugh out loud at one of their numerous movies as a kid, teenager and an adult and truth be told, I expect it from any Pixar signed piece of art, that is why I knocked 1 star down.
