2022-05-28 20:43:37.305853,NotaHumanResource,Played with a smile on my face!,"Man, this game brought me back!. Great Job Dev team! This isn't just a game within a game this is also a story within a story. I love the depth of being a VR character, playing a vr game which then transends the screen to interact with the VR world that your character is playing in with the added game of distracting the VR parents who don't want you to play in the first place.  Impressive layering of VR!  I just finished chapter one before the video store. There is some creative and funny parts of this game like the anoying neighbor kid who comes to the window to talk smack and then sucks up to your VR mom.  I have a lot of VR titles and this is definately my favorite right now.  **Feature request** I would love to be able to enter my name at the start of the game so that whenever my virtual parents, neighbors etc talk to me they use my real name. It would just add to the humor and immersion a great deal.","Oct 5, 2020 at 11:16 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 20:43:37.349735,SUPERSONICSTATION,The Next Decade of Retro Nostalgia fun !,"Youtube Review link - youtube.com/watch?v=1jEPwElviiQ&t=57s

Pixel Ripped 1989 was a gem that could only be experienced with the magic of VR. Now we fast forward to Pixel Ripped 1995 with a new decade of amazing gameplay, tons of fun and yes even console wars - ya pure nostagia. This game is every Retro Gamers Dream game. 

In the newest chapter of the acclaimed Pixel Ripped series, gamers will take an unforgettable nostalgic trip back to 1995 in this Virtual Reality love letter to classic gaming. Set in a classic era when 16-bit was evolving to 32-bit and first-generation console players were evolving from teens to adults, players will take a trip inside (and outside) of their video game screens to save the universe. In Pixel Ripped 1995, video game hero Dot will recruit the help of the best gamer of the year, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David, to face challenges together through the world of 2D games and the very first 3D games.


This game is not just a nostalgia trip it replays the hardships of many things gamers went through back in the day.  Such as sneaking to beat that last level of your favorite 90s game before your mom catches you for staying up too  late in the middle of your epic boss battle encounter. 
Graphics are great and as we all know in VR - Immersion is King and  immersion is at it's best in this game. I found times where I forgot I was playing a game within a game. 
Sound is amazing - With the 16 bit musical scores the audio does not dissapoint 
Fun Factor - It's so much fun I couldn't stop playing. If you enjoyed the first instalment then you will be enjoying this game in abundance 
I also want to add that if you are a Retro Gamer there are tons of old Nostagia 16 bit easter eggs that put a huge smile on my face.
Conclusion - ARVORE once again knocked it out of the park because this team thinks outside of the box and gives us something totally new with using our favortie childhood memories from the past. 
I love this game and this studio","Apr 24, 2020 at 6:17 PM",5, 33,

My Quick Thoughts:
Now set in 1995, Pixel Ripped takes all that it has learned from the previous title to bring us more retro goodness, that I'm sure most of you will remember.
This title takes retro-gaming and twists it into something really unique and special.
Miss it at your peril!","Apr 24, 2020 at 4:05 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:43:40.481359,ajb1978,Made me feel like a kid again,"Being scolded for sitting around the house playing video games when it was a nice summer day out was all too familiar.  I'm fortunate that I didn't have to be quite as sneaky about playing video games as this, but there are definitely parallels between me playing my Game Boy under the covers by flashlight, vs. David trying not to make too much noise, and quickly turning off the TV if his mom wakes up.
The actual gameplay is similar to the PR89 in that you play a game within a game, and occasionally the game world and real world blend and you find yourself having to take a hand off the controller to shoot some obstacles out of the way for Dot, or distract your mom.  There are some nice twists, such as switching between two entirely different games and carrying items from one to the other to advance.  And the kids yelling at each other in the video rental store really brought back the SNES vs Genesis console wars.  I got about 3 solid hours of entertainment out of it, and was able to complete it in a sitting.  Difficulty is low, and while you might miss a few jumps from time to time, checkpoints are frequent and lives are unlimited.  You won't find yourself screaming and hurling the controller across the room or anything (Contra III, I'm looking at you...) but during some of the boss battles you do have to stay on your toes and consider how the real and game worlds interact.  Replay value does unfortunately seem to be low, as it is a story driven narrative without multiple endings or branching paths.  (Unless there are but hidden, or possibly I'm just an idiot.)  I could see myself going back and giving it a second, maybe a third play through, just to see if I can pick out any more references or easter eggs.","Apr 24, 2020 at 12:14 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 20:43:40.496319,cloudkake,As a child of the 80s...,"..I can certainly tell you, stting in my virtual pajamas back in front an old CRT as a 9 year old, hoping mum wouldn't get annoyed at me, is pretty much as immersive a throw back as it gets. Im a DK1 VR veteran, little surprises me these days but just wow on what's been achieved here! It made me remember, very fondly the old school games that we loved were just all about gameplay. After the initial laughter of the retro graphics and many (many!) throwback easter eggs are experienced, you find yourself actually getting lost in how good the game within the game is. Then just as you're getting into it something will happen in the world you're meant to be in. As for the real world.. that's two game-inception layers back haha! 
Fully immersive, fully brilliant, great throwback and you can tell it's OH so lovingly crafted. Please make more!!!","May 16, 2020 at 3:19 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:43:40.511279,EddieNanakase,Very fun to play !,"Pixel Ripped 1989 was fun to play, but in my opinion I feel that Pixel Ripped 1995 was even more fun to play !  This game has great music, characters, story and it has funny scenes !  The game just surprises you, you just don't have idea of what is coming next !  The developer knows every detail of what it was like to play games from that time, they have the formula down to a bit !","May 5, 2020 at 1:04 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:43:40.526239,Thigama,Great Game!,"The whole game was really fun! The story was good, they gamplay was fun, and the graphics are great! The only issue I had was that sometimes they sounds and voices didn't match with where they were. for example: in the beginning of level 6, I noticed that the Sounds from the TV were behind me instead of coming from the TV. I also noticed that some animations in the game are kind of glitchy. for example: In the the arcade the little girl was walking into the Arcade machine and they older girl was floating behind the stool she was sitting on. But beside all of that, it was a fantastic game and I would recomend it to my friends! I just hope some of those things get fixed.","Apr 24, 2020 at 12:53 PM",3, 4,"Thanks for your feedback and we are happy to hear that you enjoy the game. We are working on some of the issues you point it out and we are uploading on the next update, coming out really soon. Stay tuned! Ana, Game Director"
2022-05-28 20:43:43.601015,JeremyC85,Perfect for anyone who grew up in 90s,"I loved Pixel Ripped 1989 and this version was even better! Loved being tranported to different 'staples' of my childhood, like sneaking in game time at night without waking parents, going to Blockbuster to rent a game, and playing on an old CRTV. The game uses the newest technology to remind us what we used to have. A++","May 23, 2020 at 12:43 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:43:43.615975,themerote,Playing 2 Games at once is Genius,"This is a bit of a spoiler alert but it was the onlyway to review this game. Yes you play 2 games at the same time, well jump from 1 to the other, it's by far the best stage in any Pixel Ripped so far. In fact this game is a big step up from 1989 and it shows, from the animation and acting in the real world and basically playing 2 games within a game is magic. I recomend this game if you like platform games and nestagia. I would love Nintendo, Sega, Atarti Etc to team up and make a game like this, or the Dev just get the permition and make it themselves. I want another Pixel Ripped but maybe a bit longer like the size of an actual Mario or Sonic game or Castlevania ha ha.","Apr 27, 2020 at 2:20 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:43:43.631933,JU5TINCREDIBLE,A true sequel in every single way!!,"I know some folks might have been skepticle that this title could easily just retread the steps of the original. Back when 1989 came out there was a sense of new wonder in the VR space, imagine being able to enter your favorite classic video game worlds and re-enact moments of your childhood with your trusty handheld gaming device... It would be easy to copy and paste those moments with new environments but I can assure you that was far from the path taken with this sequel! Every single moment of this new title feels fresh and improved upon from the first.. From characters / development, plot, locations, writing, game design, 
difficulty, every detail is exciting and smile inducing. A legitimate successor to the original, the developers truly took all of their feedback and made a massively positive fun time with their deep appreciation for all things gaming. Keep it up Arvore, Ana, and the rest of the awesome development team! Cant wait to enjoy more pixel ripped down the line!!","May 11, 2020 at 5:16 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:43:43.655868,JoBoT,Fantastimus Rex,"I played the first version of this, 1989 and I loved it. Easy to play but just hard enough occasionally to piss me off a little now and again. Over all its a nostalgia trip down you're childhood lane. Its the kind of game you would have made if you were a maker of games. And in your late 30s to mid 40s or so. Its one of those games where you just wish there was more. While being satisfied with what you got at a fair price.","Apr 25, 2020 at 3:20 PM",4, 2,

Playing this on my Quest and Valve Index via revive on my primary HMD. Love the Portuguese language sprinkled throughout the game. Totals reminds me of my little Portuguese mom scolding to drop the controllers on my SNES and go out and enjoy some fresh air. 10/10 Super Mario Bobbleheads","Apr 24, 2020 at 1:34 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:43:46.792479,mickfish80,"5 Stars ,Updated review","I waited ages for this to finally get released and was not to happy with my purchase to be honest.
Asked for a refund but Whist waiting for my refund I re purchased it again to give it a longer trial as I love classic gaming,I must admit I was totally wrong about this games.
It's just great and a lot of thought has gone into this nostalgia game with classic arcade games to play  ,a blast from the past.
Great story also,I have 1989 via Link,need this to also be ported to the Quest or sidequest for purchase.

Developer responded quick and added there will be more updates to come.More features and modes to add more game playability,let's see...

Great work and a must buy,I'm 48 and enjoyed playing this great game,it's a bit on the short side but the price kinda reflects that.

Controls are good and responsive ,slot of  dialogue,which can be annoying,but a few quick presses sorts that out.","Apr 25, 2020 at 11:49 PM",5, 1,"Hello friend!

Thank you so much for your kind words and for supporting us and playing our game. We’re happy that you enjoyed it! Stay tuned for updates in the future that will add more features and modes to the game!!"
