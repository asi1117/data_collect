2022-05-28 20:42:29.091302,Deeperbeige,"Uninspired, samey, unpolished","So much potential, but it's wasted by laziness. Whilst this game isn't entirely without merit, it feels distinctly low-effort for the following reasons:

1. There might be 50 puzzles, but they're just variations of the same thing. There's no progression or imagination or different concepts explored. I don't think there's even a good exploration of the limited puzzle space that exists. You could for example have puzzles where you have to connect two different paths up, but I don't think that's ever necessary.

2. The voice acting is terrible, and beyond repetitive. Every time you connect a piece, it plays one of about 5 lines which gets old really fast.

3. No options. No settings or comfort choices. Just very slow slide movement, no remote grab/place. No way to play seated. No nothing!

4. No ending. It just stops having a next puzzle. The button is where it always is, it just doesn't work.

5. Why does this have to be full scale? I almost couldn't place one piece because the pipe was so high up. I'm 6ft2 and was only just able to reach high enough. How could kids play this?

6. Never really gets challenging. Puzzle 50 was the only one I had to consider at all to get through. Puzzle 34 was baffling and rejected several valid-looking attempts, for no adequately explained reason.

7. Lack of polish. There's a few ""out"" pipes that aren't on the walls. There's no background music. It's dingy and cold feeling, and lacking personality.

In summary, it's an interesting concept, but implemented with no flair or imagination.","Jun 15, 2020 at 6:35 PM",2, 4,"Thanks for the reply,
Try the new updated version of Plumber, the experience is way more improved from the very first version of the game.
The new update of the game contains new levels and features."
