2022-05-28 14:55:24.963762,voldy93,Good game but fix the movement/Collision,"I have played this game before VR and even then I was like this would make such an amazin VR game. 
So I got it no questions asked. love solving puzzles very well designed and very simple. 

I cant play with teleport, I have been using VR long enough to be annoyed when a game doesnt have free move, teleportation is not for me. 

But I swear to god, the free movement is so bad and annoying that I wanna throw my controllers, you get stuck for nothing every few seconds, and then you have to leave the trigger and move again, there is nothing you are colliding with, unless the flowers and grass have some sort of weird collision boxes. Please fix the movement issues, they are consistent and more than often to disrupt a good gameplay experience. 

If you are good with teleportation you probably wont have this issue. 
But regardless I dont regret buying this game at all, money well spent.","Sep 8, 2019 at 4:17 AM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 14:55:24.978722,northerner2,,"Love this game. Awesome story, makes you think, puzzle complexity increases as you learn new techinques. Keep exploring, you'll find some easter eggs!

Only two things I would improve
- Not getting put on the other side of the map when you run into something (If I try to move past a tree and accidently go into it, I get shot backwards a hundred feet)
- Being in the air sucks and causes motion sickeness - I understand that flying through the air in VR with FPV can cause worse motion sickness, but I literally can never see anything until I land. I get a one second glimpse of the character in the air, if I happen to be facing the right direction.","Aug 21, 2019 at 7:31 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 14:55:24.995677,cScottD,Almost a 5-Star Game (UPDATED!),"I wish I could give this game 5 stars, because it truly is an amazing, immersive game, with beautiful settings, an intriguing storyline, clever puzzles, and one of the best and most configurable movement schemes I've ever seen in a VR game... Unfortunately, it has one flaw (that in my particular case, makes some parts of the game very frustrating). 

Picking up items is inconsistent, and in some cases, extremely finicky. For some objects, you have to literally move your hand around to find the ""sweet spot"" where it will let you grab the object.  Some objects are worse than others, and thankfully most of them aren't as bad, but the ones that do are very annoying to deal with.

In my particular case, this can make trying to pick up objects that are below me very difficult. I am severely handicapped, so I can't play Standing Mode games at all, and even some Sitting Mode games are unplayable, because they require you to bend over and reach down to the floor or physically swivel around to face behind you (neither of which I can do). I can move my arms and upper body freely, but I can't bend down or turn around. Because of the twitchy object interaction, objects that are below me are sometimes difficult for me to pick up.

Thankfully, this is now just a source of annoyance and frustration (thus the 4-star rating). Until recently, picking up boxes required practically ""touching"" them, which meant that puzzles that requires multiple interactions with objects below me were impossible, so I was unable to proceed with the game at all. Fortunately, it is now possible to interact with boxes by pointing your hand straight at them and moving it around slightly until the selection outline shows up, which means I'm now able to continue with the game.

They got so many other things so right. If they could improve object interaction, this would be a 5-star game, and one of the best on the Rift.","May 30, 2019 at 4:27 PM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 14:55:25.010636,Raketeer,A perfect game for my tastes.,"The first time it came on sale here, I balked, though it was on my wishlist. (I hadn't heard of much less played the ""flat"" version.) Then I was able to score a *really* inexpensive version, so I snapped it up. At around A3 it came on sale again here, and I bought it again, just to support Croteam and their efforts. I love this game. I love the puzzles; I can free roam without any nausea; I can recognize names from a podcast I like that recounts the history of philosophy. Win, win, win. Love it!","Feb 18, 2019 at 11:08 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:55:25.025596,Lotom,"Love the game, controls need work.","The game and puzzles are fun. It is amazing to be in the worlds, sometimes I go hang out in the gardens just to hang out in the gardens. However, I eventually got so frustrated with the controls that I gave up trying to solve the puzzles in the last area. Challenging puzzles is one thing, but failing puzzles multiple times because I'm struggling to pick up an item is just annoying. Anything on the floor or below is nearly impossible, making any level with mobile platforms really painful. Ironically, the devs nailed movement, which is usually the hardest part.","Jan 23, 2019 at 1:05 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:55:28.149829,EviLorD,WOW - AMAZING GAME!,"Everyone needs to pay attention to how this game allows you to modify all the settings from graphics to movement...  #1 in any game is that and they nailed it 1000%   Everything is just better from there.  the audio sounds GREAT the visuals are amazing and the puzzles have been so fun..  if you enjoy figureing out how to get from one point to another with obsticals and a puzzle to solve to get there this is a game you will NEVER stop playing..  The world looks extreemly large..  I had NO regrets paying for this game!  I wish that other games would take after just the movement settings of this one!  
Thank you for an AMAZING GAME!!!","Dec 8, 2018 at 10:40 AM",5, 38,
2022-05-28 14:55:28.164789,owenwp,,"Generally quite good and immersive, but one big problem: by default the world scale is wrong. It isn't just that the environment seems the wrong size, your actual tracking is exaggerated. So when you move your head, your view moves a little extra, and your hands move farther and look bigger. You can see it pretty clearly by toggling the dash menu. This can be fixed by going to the settings menu and changing world scale back to 1, but it is very bad and sickness inducing that this is not the default. Really it shouldn't even be an option.

Another minor issue is that you have to pull the trigger to drop objects, which is probably just how it worked on Vive but it is unintuitive and awkward, especially for the block puzzles where you have to pick up and drop often.","Dec 9, 2018 at 7:08 AM",4, 29,

My Initial Thoughts:
With over 20 hours of content and from the creators of the Serious Sam series of games comes an amazing portal-esque puzzle game. The normal 2D version of this game has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam and is 1 of my top Steam Curator Recommendations. It's now in VR and is a dream come true. DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS GEM! - AWESOME STUFF!
