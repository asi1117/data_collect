2022-05-28 19:51:10.067961,Nektwo,Cool game!,"It is fun game while you start playing. But next you will pay attention to the story. That is real story of a person who live in wheel chair. The begining is sad. Just after bad accident. But then he will tell you  ""It is all limitations inside your head"". And he changed his life to become best in sports and travel the world! 
Very inspiring!

The game is not so real. You will be challanged with impossible levels you'll never see in real life. But it is fun and sunny experience.

There is some glitches but I hope they will be fixed in next releases.","May 11, 2018 at 3:49 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 19:51:10.082921,Aramx42,Fun game,"Haven't played it much yet but I can already say that it's a really fun game. The controls are unique and chaotic, but that's the whole point of the game about wheelchairs. Crossing roads and the like is very exciting and stressful. The narrator has a voice that's nice to listen to. The game seems well optimized and does not need high specs to run smoothly. 
It's an unique concept and the main message is very clear: it's hard to survive in a wheelchair when everyone around you is a deadly obstacle :p
Kudos!","May 12, 2018 at 3:40 AM",5, 5,
