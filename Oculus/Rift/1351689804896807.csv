2022-05-28 19:17:58.474395,WHITEWOLF660,Only a Demo,This may have been free however it is a single mission demo about 5 mins long. gameplay is fun and its well made. The 1 Star is because this can be implemented into a full MMO or otherwise and they chose not to do that and use the demo as a plug for mobile gaming. would be 0/5 if i could for the sheer greed and minimal follow through,"Apr 16, 2021 at 5:29 AM",1, 12,

 by looking at your target and after a few seconds of practice, it's easy to strafe as well.  My only complaint is that it is rather dark so a lot of the details do get lost. If this was converted to a full VR game I'd be one of the first to buy it in a heart beat.","Dec 14, 2018 at 8:49 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 19:18:26.916323,Mach13-13,Want to know where the full game is?,"This is a superb VR demo... But If you want to know where the full game is... click on the pixonic.com web-link in the game details.

 Its all on their website. The original War Robots game is on Google Play for free.  This VR version is I guess a reimagining of it but it seems if i've read it right that it was a 'crowd funded' kick-starter that for some reason (marketing maybe?) didn't make its target. 
 The last funding target date I saw was May 2018 and it missed it's target by a considerable margin.  I just hope they haven't given up.  I can't help but think that they might have helped themselves if they'd explained some of this in their game detail so that more people would have clicked on their link.  But that's just speculation.  Maybe programming for VR is still an emerging market that is still too young and limited to be successfully crowd funding for it.

Is it worth downloading this FREE VR version? YES definitely.. I've used it as a demo for friends to introduce them to VR and they are amazed every time by this

Head movement should be used to lock on missiles and look around.

But the few minutes of gameplay are absolutely a blast and leave you wondering why nobody has made this into a full release AAA title yet.  And yes, Oculus touch controllers do work (as a gamepad).  In case  you're wondering, I had to refund Archangel on the recent sale because it was so boring and I downloaded this game twice (Steam and now on here).  Highly recommend this VR demo to show off to friends and family for quick, intense, and easy gameplay.","Nov 16, 2017 at 11:28 AM",5, 3,"Thank you for playing!
