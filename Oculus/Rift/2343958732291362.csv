2022-05-28 18:52:51.356396,HarbingerThrace,"It is basically Mariokart in VR, AWESOME","So much fun and what I like about it is that it has online multiplayer with bots to make it more exciting so my fiance and I play a lot.  And you can make your own sort of cups so it is not just a boring single multilplayer race.  It also has several tournaments every day.  

I recommend you select the motion controllers to move BUT use the joystick option.  That way it is the best of both worlds as you can steer with the joystick, but throw items with your right hand, which is a lot more fun.  Otherwise you can just use a regular controller. 

Great job devs.  This game is great =)","Oct 15, 2020 at 4:36 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:52:51.372353,DominicDJC,This game is lots of fun but not perfect,"I love this game, but there are so many little things that could have been much better. The gameplay is amazing and lots of fun, that's the best (and most important) thing about the game. The visuals are okay, but they could be better. When you reset your position it doesn't really seem like you are placed properly in the car. The animations are okay, but not as smooth as they could be. The controls for using both Touch controllers could have been better, and using the joystick doesn't feel the same as an xbox controller. This is just a personal opinion, but the person that just sits there and looks at you is just there for no reason. She does apsolution nothing and I just find her unnecessary. Overall it's a fun game and worth the money. If this game does manage to make it to the Quest, that would be amazing.","Feb 7, 2020 at 7:18 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:52:51.386316,Dakronic1981,Loved this game,"Only played few times as i stream lot games but this is great game glad i got in the sale

Tracks are medium lenght but from what i read the dev has made formula 1 tracks in this mario  kart vr style gameplay

It needa couple things 

Crossplay quest pc everything should be into  as 1 online
Multiplayer death match not just racing style 
Like in a arena

And ofcourse what everyone is probably thinking  mario  kart sprite dlc pack for player skins  this would be epic","Feb 3, 2020 at 5:01 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:52:51.401276,hymanator,Good foundation for a Mario Kart VR game,"There is a solid framework to make this game a great one, just keep in mind it is still in ""early access"".

Loved:
- Cartoon style to vehicles, characters, and environments gives a Mario Kart vibe
- Supports my PlayStation 2 logitech racing wheel with force feedback (using a racing wheel with my left hand and aiming my weapons with my touch controller is a really fun arcade-like gameplay mechanic)
- Very original weapons and powerups, like drinking a soda or closing one eye to aim a bazooka while driving
- Lots of replay value with multiple tracks and tons of unlockables
-Online cross-platform multiplayer (Thinking about buying a 2nd copy for PSVR)

Disliked:
- Tracks are extremely small with extremely sharp hair-pin turns, making it difficult to play with a steering wheel controller and the constant turning made the motion sickness kick-in faster than expected. I would prefer large, wide, and open tracks with longer straight-away sections. This would allow to put more focus on aiming weapons.
- I can't figure out how to drift and I have no idea what it looks/feels like. Would be nice to see ""air trails"" around you along with some tire skidding sounds.
- Many weapons feel useless, since they require precision aiming and I often miss. The short range weapons like the hammer require you to be really close to an opponent, and they always seem out of reach. Weapons like the bazooka feel great to use, but they are buried behind too many mediocre ones.

Final thoughts:
Overall, this game is pretty good, but it needs better track designs. I would personally love to see a level editor of some sort, with a way to draw out your own tracks and share them with the community. I want to see tracks that are large, beautiful, and easier to navigate. The small tracks currently feel a bit too intense in their current state. On a monitor I'm sure they feel fine, but VR amplifies everything in general. Sorry if I come across too negative, I still like this game overall.","Dec 16, 2019 at 4:32 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 18:52:51.417233,3DeMan,Great fun - but not perfect,"Is this a good game? Yes
Is it worth buying as it stands? Yes
Is it 5 star perfect? No

The game is well worth picking up (especially at this reasonable price) and it really does scratch the Kart itch. There is tons of content and it is by far the best Kart game in VR atm (although the competition is not exactly great!).
It's great fun to play and has high production values. 

It is also a good start to what could be a great game. 
As others have said - it needs more lengthy and complex tracks. The inspiration is obviously Mario Karts and it does have that Nintendo vibe about it. I hope the devs go and look again at that game and the more complex tracks and varied environments (varied in the way they play). The tracks here at the moment look great, but feel a little flat and too short. 

I gave one star more than I should, as I do not want to put anyone off from buying it. It is well worth the purchase - even with these caveats.

As for the whole Quest thing - well done Oculus, one of the reasons I am not buying a Quest is the seeming random curation that keeps this and other *good* games out of the Quest walled-garden. (do the people you pay actually *play* the games?)","Sep 8, 2019 at 6:58 PM",4, 21,Thank you very much for the feedback. The current game circuits are inspired by the real Formula 1 circuits. But to make an extra pack of circuits that are crazier and more similar to the ones Mario Kart has would be spectacular. We depend on the support of the people to keep working on the game. Good reviews certainly help.
2022-05-28 18:52:54.551850,VR-CG-Gamer,"Incredible, Oculus Needs Quest Version","Wow, This is such a great game... I’ve always dreamed of playing Mario Kart in VR, this is even better. The developers have been so creative and made this game so much fun. This makes every other kart game look amateurish. 

I purchased on Rift because Oculus rejected the game on Quest. All they allowed the developers to show them was a 2 page pdf proposal. Oculus never saw or played the game before denying it, what a disservice to Quest customers and an unprofessional way to treat developers.

This sort of curation makes me wonder if my investment into the quest platform was a mistake, since I continually find myself returning to the rift platform to purchase denied games.

This is a must have game on any platform, hopefully Oculus will eventually realize they are depriving quest users of a wonderful experience and causing themselves and the developers to miss a great opportunity for additional revenue.

If you like the game and want to see it on Quest, you can help by taking 30 seconds to sign the petition to bring this game to Oculus Quest:

no: feels a little sick after 4 races; some options doesn t works like ""vignettes"" in french (when you re turning the vision isn t smaller, that s a problem for me). thanks to do something  about it!

2022-05-28 18:52:54.582767,Matrix_Man,Not great....yet,"This game has alot of potential and for early access it's off to a good start.  It however is no where near mario kart quality.  I wouldn't of thought I would need to mention that but many reviewers are saying it is or is close when it's neither.  The biggest problem I have is the physics of the karts (drifting, turning) and the layout/ track design.  Both need alot more work.  Is this currently the best mario kartish game in VR?  YES!  Will you have fun playing it in it's current state?  YES!  Is this game worth buying now and supporting the developer?  YES!","Sep 8, 2019 at 1:18 AM",3, 4,"We do not intend to make a game like Mario Kart because we are aware of our size. But we are not charging the price of Mario Kart nor do we expect people to rate us demanding the same as if we were Nintendo.
In any case, we are taking very good note of all the comments and we will try to do our best to please all of them. Hopefully we continue to receive enough support to allow us to do so."
2022-05-28 18:52:54.597727,philig220,Great fun,finally took the leap was on the fence for a while and wow im glad i did what a great game works really well with my wheel the thustmaster t150 only problem is i wish i wouldve bought it earlier nice job devs,"Oct 21, 2019 at 11:21 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:52:54.611689,movement1957,Mario clone it all the way,"This game could be really big.  But if your going to copy off of Mario kart they might as well go for it all the way.  We need something like shells to throw.  Also how about two players on the same kart like double dash. And I would love bigger tracks with some jumps.  Also more variation in the worlds like ice fire, under water.  The base game is a great start.  Need more time in the cooker","Sep 7, 2019 at 11:59 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 18:52:57.732343,IamRuuts,Is buying this even a consideration?,"This game is exactly what it is touted to be....the closest thing to Mario Kart in VR!   I was given a free key from the devs for the Podcast Wes and I do, Virtual Strangers, on steam.  Thanks to the devs for this btw :D   I've been playing it for a week and decided to record a lets play and for whatever reason the cpu usage on obs was super high and effected performance.  While I wasn't recording it ran good, but as soon as I started recording it shot cpu usage sky high.  It still has 3 days till launch on steam so I'm sure the devs are already fixing this issue before then. It appears to be an oculus rift hardware to steam  software issue and I am happy to tell you the oculus version ran flawlessly with obs and I am about to record the let's play.   Is this game worth buying?  Hell yes, I bought it on oculus to support these amazing devs and because this game is just that good!  I haven't had this much fun not only in VR, but playing any game in years.   Buy it....don't think about it, just do it!","Sep 8, 2019 at 10:17 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:52:57.747303,PeacemakerX,It has potential,"At the moment the wheel is no option at all because the maximum sensitivity is way too low. And if you play with controller you get stuck in the menues from time to time and have to restart the game. This game has big potential but the driving physics (yeah even in a fun racer you need some physics) must get better and the bugs must be patched away. EDIT: i forgot to say that this is not nearly a 5 star game at the moment (these ratings are nuts). But i think we should support it! --- EDIT 2 for DEV: my racing wheel is the Thrustmaster T150 (which is very common in VR-gaming). The problems with the menues i had with my XBOX 360 wireless controller. I tried to, but I cannot reconstruct the problem.","Sep 11, 2019 at 3:08 AM",3, 2,"We have released the game in Early Access to polish all these details quickly. We respond much faster and in a personalized way by e-mail (support@ivanovichgames.com). We have tested various models of steering wheels and we have not detected any problems. Here for example you can see the game running with a G29: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVanh2rH2-I could you give us more information about your configuration? I suspect that perhaps the code that limits the turns of the steering wheel to 180 degrees is not working, which is the best in a kart game.
About the menus: What control are you using? It is a bug very easy to solve. Thanks for report it EDIT 2: Please write us to the support mail and we'll help you"
2022-05-28 18:52:57.763260,FastLawyer,Great potential,"This is probably the best Mario Kart clone in VR currently. However, it's in Early Access and, as of build 25, it has a lot of bugs. What I really like is the different controller options (you can use gamepad, wheel, motion controllers, etc.), however, it's missing a way to use motion controller to move the wheel versus using the joystick on your controller to move left or right. The visuals are good & game runs smoothly on my 1060 GTX. There's several tracks & karts & upgrades & powerup combos to unlock. However, the missions to unlock stuff can be hit or miss and the bugs include not being able to choose items in the menu, not getting any money (may have been fixed with the latest update), and the sound not working. The collision physics and AI could also use some fine-tuning. I'd like to see more variety in the tracks themselves (like flying or going underwater in the track or shortcuts!)

We have done the control of the virtual steering wheel with one hand for example in Operation Warcade. But in this game being very fast and having jumps is a bad idea. We have tried in all ways and it is impossible."
2022-05-28 18:52:57.778220,Desperatedolphi,trouble with the controls,"I spent a long time trying to get it to work with my thrustmster wheel but with no success, which is a shame because I was very excited by it!

I dont have the heart to give it a low rating as I'm sure this is somthing that the developer will fix and it really is a great looking game filling a nice Niche.

I'm going to refund for now but if i get a responce on how to fix this I'll eagerly buy again.","Sep 11, 2019 at 1:26 AM",4, 0,"Hi, we have thrustmster wheel and it's works perfect.

Also, it gives me an excuse to use my wheel after realising that I am horrible at driving sims lol. It feels so good behind a wheel with a touch controller.

The polish is incredibly high and i can tell when this game officially realeases it will have a thriving online community. However there is two major things they need to implement

1) visual feedback for drifting. Half the time i can not tell if am drifting correctly and if not what i am doing wrong. There is a reason why drifting in mario kart and crash team racing have visual feedback as you can instantly tell when you have entered a drift

2) Can you implement some for of tutorial or interactive beggining to show how to combine weapons. This is a brang new mechanic for this game and really could use explanation.
