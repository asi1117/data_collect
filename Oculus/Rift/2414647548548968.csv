The way you can somewhat control your trajectory with the movement of your hand without losing that feeling of actually swinging is fantastic, and is far superior to the usual method of just pulling the player toward the point they grapple onto. The only thing for me that would be helpful is the ability to turn off controller vibrate, as the ""perform acrobatics with wrist movements"" setting shakes my vision while it vibrates. Still, this is by defenitely my favorite VR game atm",Apr 14 at 1:56 PM,5, 1,"I'm humble and happy that you appreciated the core game concept, which is exactly what I set out to build. But I am astonished that you claim the vibration is the only nuisance when turning on the acrobatics with wrist movement 😅. This was a highly experimental feature that I never quite nailed, because I just started vomiting out my ears every time I test-played it. The VR legs are strong with this one. 🙇"
2022-05-28 19:36:14.247192,GKirt,Great start,"I think the game is great. The controls are good and the physics is pretty good as well. With the controls (your hands) being 3D and speed sensitive, there is a very high skill ceiling and battleing for the fastest time is fun. I could see this having a decent competitive aspect in the future, like racing and time trials.","Feb 21, 2020 at 6:29 AM",5, 5,"That is awesome! I'm glad you enjoyed it, what you describe is exactly the experience I hoped to provide, thanks :-)"

I'm missing a tutorial. Landscape and graphics is very poor and simple, do not look much realistic. It looks weird that the city just ends at a green surface. Basically, the game is quite interesting and fun. I like the possibility to change many settings.","Dec 31, 2019 at 3:40 AM",3, 18,
