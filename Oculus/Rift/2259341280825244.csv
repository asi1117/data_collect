2022-05-28 20:57:42.270873,Hulk_Krogan414,Left Handed User,"Good game. UNFORTUNATELY it's not left handed friendly. Although you can switch to left handed it automatically swaps your analog sticks so you're turning with the left controllerand moving with the right. Tried to keep it as default or swap to fix but either way if you play left handed you're forced to turn with the left analog stick and move with right analog stick. Really hoping for a fix on this.

Also, no head orientation option so your movement follows your controller. Wish we could choose.

Would be great to have bots and a practice/training mode. This way you could test controller setting without constantly being killed or having to exit game lobby.

Game has great visuals which surprised me coming from PSVR Firewall. Would love to see what Firewall would look like on PC now.","May 26, 2021 at 4:33 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:57:45.370583,user045,Limited Players,"I used to play this but stopped because I was waiting over 10 mins sometimes to get a game. Devs made some small improvements but the player base didn't increase. Overall I liked the game but it frustrated me how quickly and easily everyone would die. I'd  just get back into the game and then be dead. Expect to get killed a lot. The interface to create a shield in this game is so unintuitive. Very fast game, too fast but some will like. The potential to make this game excellent could be achieved. My suggestions would be to make it more skill based and reduce deaths. Learn from Echo Combat which really focuses on skill and ease of use to implement weapons.","Jun 3, 2021 at 10:30 PM",2, 1,

-> Devs are working fulltime to improve the game quality and add new features, contents as maps, weapons, squad up system etc.. Private server soon...

-> The game only multiplayer opposes 4 players against 4 players, with the alone goal to keep the area (moving) on each round. Weapons, Shield, Health, Mine etc.. can give you the advantage on your opponents, so jump up !

-> I recommend this VR Experience, the gampleplay is smooth ! 

-> With this game, i meet a lot of new friends !!

2022-05-28 20:57:45.430423,JaxsonPawlick,Most Comfortable FPS VR Game,"When I play most shooters the movement feels slightly off and I can get motion sickness fairly easily. But with this game I can play for long stretches without any side effects. Every other games smooth turn doesn't feel as good, and this game is fast paced which would normally be hard to deal with, but I don't have any problems sliding or running around and full speed.

Updates have been pretty meaty so far. Looking forward to what else they add to the game. GIVE ME MORE!","Dec 17, 2020 at 12:47 PM",5, 4,"Thank you, we have so much more to come!"
2022-05-28 20:57:48.524148,Yucci,Amazing game with bad controls,"***EDIT***
After playing it for a while i gotta change from a 5 to a 3 star. 
The game is super early so take it with a grain of salt! But check out the pros / cons

The game is amazing, and I'd get it straight away, which I did lmao

Here are some Pros and Cons:

Pros:

- Satisfying Gameplay
- Super nice visuals
- Great performance (very easy on GPU / CPU)
- You pay for the game and nothing else (No deluxe edition, no in game itemshop, you earn cosmetics trough progressions and grinding)

Cons:


- Feels like a console port (They dont really feel like theyre meant for VR, it feels like youre trying to emulate an xbox controller in vr, had a hard time sliding as i accidentally crouched or stopped running)
- No offhand on weapons (You cant assist your aiming with your offhand, you only aim with your main hand, and dont use your other hand for anything other than moving and using abilities, even tho you can move your off hand around in the main menu)
- No HMD oriented movement (you only use your weapon hand to move, so you can aim while walking another direction as eaisly as you couldve done it with HMD based movement) 
- No option for Physical crouching (you have to use a button to crouch, which is a big nono) 
- theres a lot of AFKs and people who leave midgame (and theres no way to join midgame so Ive had games where i played against a whole team alone and more)
- Horrible matchmaking screens (putting on a helmet in the main menu to search for a game is super cool, but the thing is youre gonna sit in a black screen with some text saying ""Looking for players / looking for game"" and theres nothing else to do other than wait) I would've loved to see social hub or a practice range to join inbetween games

Final words:

The game is very nice and feels polished, other than the controls and VR implementation. If they fixed the mentioned cons Im giving it a 5/5. The game is still fun and i like it but yeah, buy it to support the devs so they can have the fixes done faster!","Sep 26, 2020 at 6:59 PM",3, 94,
2022-05-28 20:57:48.539108,LionheartUK,Game feals like a janky Consol port,The menu system is designed for a Consol controler not VR and your left arm/hand arn't tracked. You're essentualy playing this 1 handed with no crontrol over your left arm at all. This is an amputee simulator not a game lol No idea who thought that was a smart move. Will update after more playtime but i think this is something people should be aware of. Janky controler menu and 1 hand tracking.,"Sep 25, 2020 at 2:03 AM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 20:57:48.553071,term_vr,Terrible.  Controls are garbage.,"This game has a lot of potential, but for $25 I'm shocked at how garbage the control system is.

For starters, the biggest problem I see is there is NO LEFT HAND PLAYER SUPPORT.  If you are left hand dominant, you are F***ED.  

How are you going to charge $25.00 and not even allow left handed players to use their dominant hand.  

I think the game could be REALLY fun but the controls being so jacked for left handed players is an instant refund, no thanks, good bye.","Sep 25, 2020 at 12:56 PM",1, 16,
2022-05-28 20:57:48.568031,MallPretzel,"Great fast-paced shooter, weird controls","The game is awesome. Fast paced, satisfying, and fluid. M conly complaint is your left hand (controller) isn't tracked at all, even though it grabs the gun. It is really odd and breaks the immersion quite a bit. If they give you control of your left hand it would be much better. Very fun overall though, great team based and objective based arena shooter.","Sep 25, 2020 at 10:01 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 20:57:48.582991,xcali978,"Awesome game, but a bit confusing","You're supposed to be a VR superathlete, but you're apparently stuck in a wheelchair because you can't jump.  Also the left hand snapping to your gun whenever it gets within 2 feet of your right kinda ruins the immersion.  If you're going to have the guns operate one-handed then the graphics should reflect that (IMO the IK should work more like in Echo Arena/Combat).  I'd give it 5 stars if those 2 things weren't issues.  Gameplay is really awesome besides that","Oct 6, 2020 at 11:35 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 20:57:51.690679,stumpynub,Could be better,"It’s definitely a fun little faced paced shooter, but the controls are where it falls short for me. Having one arm glued to a spot while still having to use that controller feels very weird and seems like a lazy implementation of VR mechanics. Besides the controls and the lacking content  (no party system so no playing with friends ), It could end up being a nice polished game with future updates.","Sep 25, 2020 at 3:03 AM",2, 9,
2022-05-28 20:57:51.706636,ParadiseDecay,The Future of VR Shooters is Here!,"My Quick Thoughts:
From the developers of the NO.1 shooting game on PSVR Firewatch.
Oh MAN this was amazing!!!!
I was a massive fan of Quake & Laser Quest back in the day and Solaris has taken all those cool elements and hectic gameplay and added them all into one glorious VR box!
I was lucky enough o play with some of the developers of the game, fellow VR YouTubers and a few Firewatch pro players.
No pun intended but I had a blast and could not wait to play more.
This is the game I will be coming back to, time after time. It was an Incredible experience. Super smooth, super fast and super slick.
These guys have NAILED IT!
I did have a lot more gameplay to show you guys, I even got another MVP match.... but sadly the rest of my video recording was corrupt.

2022-05-28 20:57:51.736556,Ryaliss,Was really really excited for this,"This game lacks so much on sooooooooo many basic levels.

No social features on day one? that´s a pass for so many players right there.
One hand weapon handling in 2020? ???
Clunky controls that cannot be changed
this game wants to be on an esport level, yet cannot provide a basic social experience on day one?
It´s pretty clear this is not finished at all and they could´ve used 4 more months to polish this up.
Releasing this game as a Preseason and expecting people to look past such lacking basic mechanics like social features is gonna be the death sentence for this game if it is not fixed before the release of population one.
Een though it is another genre, I have the feel the Vr Community is looking for a game they can all enjoy and once that is established other multiplayer games will have a hard time to compete.
I want to see this game succeed because I loved Quake and I loved DOOM, yet if this is the stage of the game the next weeks its not going to.
The core gameplay is good, allthough the weapons lack uniqueness (looking past the one handed handling)

This release will leave a sour taste in the mouths of many VR players and will halt progression of mass adoption quite a lot.","Sep 30, 2020 at 7:08 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 20:57:51.751516,ColeSlavic,The closest you'll get to Quake in VR,"This game is an absolute blast to play! The mechanics are sound. The art style is very futuristic. Matches start fairly quickly, and everyone has been friendly so far.

It really gives you the feeling of being in a classic arena shooter. Better in every way thanks to VR! The game has some issues which the developers intend to adress soon, but they are in no way gamebreaking for me personally.

Since this is technically Preseason, there is no party system as of yet. The developers have made clear on their socials and through interviews that it's starting this way to help onboard players. Essentially get everyone to learn the game first before letting them squad up with friends and get competitive.

Another noteable thing people seem to dislike is that the weapons are all technically one handed. Bringing your offhand close to the weapon will make it visibily grab onto it, but your main hand is what controls all of the actual aim. Not really a negative for me as I two hand everything like a pistol (Left hand under my Right for support).

The only personal gripe I have is no proper fullscreen or spectator view for recording videos, but if you're not a content creator this is a non issue and something I'm sure will be addressed in the future.

If you've been waiting for a solid multiplayer arena shooter in VR that will constantly evolve and add new content, look no further! I highly recommend giving the game a chance if you're willing to wait for some features to be implemented. The developers seem very dedicated to the project so I have faith they will continually improve the already solid experience in the months to come.","Sep 25, 2020 at 6:41 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 20:57:54.864191,ScoobyVR,Great game but...,"Untill this game is let out of Oculus prison and released to Steam and PS4, there isn't enough people playing to start a single match at 10:00am (-5GMT) durring a global pandemic.

Feels like a port and so leaves room for many improvements.

But when there's actual players this is Awesome. Getting real Halo vibes. Not enough maps, and the sprint function will destroy your touch controller's left joystick until the devs apply common sense. Otherwise this has the makings of a FPS eSport. 3 outa 5 till all above is corrected.","Oct 22, 2020 at 10:06 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:57:54.888127,ReQtum_,Best Arena FPS on VR,"- Very smooth gameplay, graphics are very nice and game is very well optimized.
This is fast paced, shoot and die old school arena like-game.

- There is negative reviews, that game uses only one hand tracking, it doesnt affect your gameplay, trust me. I believe, that reason for this tracking solution is upcoming PSVR version and psvr aim controller, which uses only one hand tracking. 

- You can now switch between right or left hand tracking.

Recommended 4/5!



I upgrade my score 5/5, when they add friend/party invite system. Now you play only with randoms.","Oct 6, 2020 at 8:32 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 20:57:58.005788,superpozition,Repetitive. Boring. Lacks immersion,"This is basically a complete arcade dump.

- You have zero control over how you hold your weapon. It’s forced holding two hands which destroys any immersion
- the design itself is lazy: a basic, flat, geometrical barf with zero artistic presence other than baking generic neon colors all over the world
- you can do one thing in this game; shoot and run. Not even remotely worth the price offering.
- no story whatsoever. Even some of the most basic arcade games in the 90’s tried to incorporate at least a single ‘purpose’ as to why you’re in the world you’re in. But maybe this is because the ‘world’ is just a template stolen from some game engine. Blah. 

Another wasted VR opportunity with lazy development and art direction","Oct 3, 2020 at 8:14 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:57:58.020748,suntory_times,Great But Missing Essential Features,"The core gameplay is mostly amazing and a huge amount of fun. The lack of control with your left arm in game is strange at first, but I don't mind it at all given the style of game here. The lack of party system for playing with friends for playing with freinds however is somthing the game shouldn't have launched without.

Such a basic feature is inexusable to not be ready for such a game at release.","Oct 5, 2020 at 12:03 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 20:57:58.035708,HepCatastrophe,Run and Gun delight,"TL;DR - 5/5 definitely recommend as long as you aren't  going to complain the whole match that one of your hands isn't tracked. 

The Good: 
Fantastic fast paced fps to quench your old school Q3 Arena / UT twitch fragging needs. I'm having a blast with this title. It's cross-buy AND cross-play. Confirmed working in Virtual Desktop. 

The Bad:
Game has some launch bugs that will hopefully be rectified soon, QoL tweaks and social functionality needs to be addressed. 
 
The Ugly:
Not so much ugly, but some will not like that both hands aren't tracked, but I assure you it isn't necessary for this title. 

                                             - - - 

So, while I have a few of my own issues with the game, most of these are day one bugs type stuff. I am seeing people dogging this title, but I think it's a little too soon for that. 

This game is the vr equivalent of the fps titles of yesterday. It's focus, I feel, is to bring the same thrills of games like Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament to the vr market. If you are looking for realism, go get Onward or Pavlov. Both great games in their niche, but it's like comparing apples and oranges. All these games are fruit, just not the same kind.

Lots of people complaining about the single hand tracking, but if you spend some time playing it, you'll no doubt come to the same conclusion that the devs likely did, in that it isn't necessary for what this title is trying to accomplish. There is no reloading, you have a stock semi auto type pistol with infinite ammo, and the guns you pick up you just fire til they run out. This title is about fast paced combat, and it is streamlined for that. Just because your non dominant hand isn't tracked does not mean it isn't useful. I use mine to keep my gun hand propped up and stable, increasing my accuracy. Works like a charm. 

The menu system is kind of a mess, and there absolutely needs to be some social implementation within the game. Some ease of use functionality needs to be added for sure, as well as some other quality of life features (changing controls, push to talk,  etc). 

There are some bugs (example: at the time of writing, there seems to be an issue with the game staying stuck to your guardian, so if you take a step to the left or right, the world moves with you and it can be very disorienting), but all in all this is a solid title. All of the actual problems with the game can be rectified in post release updates.","Sep 26, 2020 at 3:41 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:57:58.050668,slice919,My first VR Addiction,"I've been waiting for this ever since the reveal a year ago, and i have to say so far the gameplay doesn't dissapoint at all. The 'only one hand is tracked' issue becomes irrelevant once you're actually playing and doesn't detract from the experience at all. However, there are a few things I've noticed that need attention. The biggest one in my opinion is that upgrades don't apply when you select them. Gun skins, helmet skins, and body skins don't change the appearance of my character at all and no matter which one I select my character always appears the same way during and after a match. Have noticed a few other players sporting the upgrades so apparently it's not an issue for everyone.","Sep 28, 2020 at 4:52 AM",4, 1,
