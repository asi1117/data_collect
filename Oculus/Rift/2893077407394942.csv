2022-05-28 20:38:43.900606,realsammyt,Feels just like the AI experience,"Agence is certainly an experience. To me, the interactions feel so similar to the ones when I'm trying to coax results out of neural networks... Trying to understand how the changes I make in my input parameters affect the results of the characters. 
Would things be clearer with a very descriptive tutorial that explained all the ins and outs... probably? However, I think the fun in this gameplay is that discovery, the confusion, realizations, thinking you ""know what to do, but is that what actually made a difference?""
Agence is a wonderful exploration into the visualization of AI and the feedback loops of Neural Nets between the user and the system. Ahead of it's time, a peak into the future.",22 days ago,5, 0,

The only main issue I have is a lack of explanation to what exactly I'm able to do. I played around a bit with this and I kept watching the first plant I put down fall to the underside of the planet, not allowing me to really watch its development. I can tell it is different each time, but sometimes it's hard to tell if they interact with the plants or not. Also the little dudes fall off the planet randomly and I can't tell if I'm just a bad lifeform-mom or they just don't stick to the surface very well by themselves. 
Otherwise the graphics are beautiful and the lil lifeforms are adorable. I love picking them up and seeing how tiny they are in my hand, I'm excited to play around with this a little more and know all their different quirks. :) Can't wait to see where this may go!","Nov 2, 2020 at 7:51 AM",4, 23,"Thank you for your important feedback Primealpha1. I will make sure to pass it along. Should you would like to try the game again, there have been updates to the game since your review."
