2022-05-28 19:59:15.031720,EchoExclusive,Feels like more for Google Cardboard,"The gaze mechanic feels like this game is more for google cardboard. Sincec I played this on the Rift, I'm rating this game soley based on Rift expereince. Good thing that the environment was mostly the same color, because the the type of movement this game has can cause some nausea/dizzines (even though it is slowly moving). I personally don't like this type of movement since I can get dizzy, I just had to focus on areas where it was all white/grey so it will feel like I""m wasn't moving.  Not sure what happened in chp1, but I can't keep going on to chap 2 & 3 as I did not get hooked.","Jan 20, 2020 at 9:11 AM",2, 1,
