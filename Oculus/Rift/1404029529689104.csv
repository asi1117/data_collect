2022-05-28 13:55:47.839891,Batsugun21,Arcade fun,"I love light gun games at the arcade. This plays like a light gun game but better in VR. Good graphics, fun guns, crazy fruit enemies. Super satisfying when fruit goes splat. The weapons are lots of fun to shoot.  

This is a good family game. I highly recommend it.","Feb 6, 2021 at 9:29 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 13:55:51.038453,Nonebetter,Fun and well made game - hillarious!,"Another game with funny narration, sounds like the old slug lady from Monsters Inc.

Shoot fruit, get points, new levels, multiple game modes, bonuses, lots of guns, change their order, all sorts of good stuff. Plus you can pull the pin on grenades with your mouth! such a good idea!

Graphics are cartoonish but very fun to interact with. I had no idea I would panic so much playing a grocery based game haha!","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:55 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 13:55:51.054409,Coillingclover,No Sound,"looks like a great game however I seem to be having problems getting the sound to work though the Oculus Rift headset for this game.

update:
This game is really fun even thou I am still unable to get the sound to work thou the Rift headset instead of my PC speakers.","Apr 27, 2019 at 4:51 AM",4, 5,"Hi Coillingclover! That doesn't sound good to us. Shoot us an email at support@ndreams.com and I'll troubleshoot it for you :)

2022-05-28 13:55:51.070367,roonay,Best VR-game I have played!,Really good gameplay and graphics. Super fun. I didnt know that packing groceries and being attacked by killer fruit could be this much fun!,"Mar 22, 2019 at 12:57 AM",5, 4,"Hey Roonay
So happy to hear that you love blasting fruit as much as we do!"
2022-05-28 13:55:54.171199,taquitobuddy,"Great VR demo, with a few downsides","Pros:
-Lots of guns with a customizable loadout
-Lots of levels with 3-4 different ""jobs""
-Nice visuals and sound that fit the game
-Unique mashup of genres ""job sim"" meets ""waveshooter""

Cons
-Gets repetitive if trying to get the achievements, and especially if trying to do the marathon ones (30+ minutes each)
-Having to watch the job sim, watch the enemies, and watch the weapon line makes the game frantic to the point of being frustrating
-Some crashes, might not entirely be the game's fault but not sure

Overall I'd give this 3.5 stars.  It is a great game to show someone new to VR, because it is a lot of fun for 15-30 minutes at a time and very intuitive controls.  But as a long-term game to play regularly, harder to recommend.  While I applaud the creatively of the genre mash-up, I didn't really enjoy the job-sim part myself.","Jan 18, 2019 at 3:53 AM",3, 8,

2022-05-28 13:55:54.203114,ZexPolygon,,"I enjoyed this game alot , the concept of having to unlock weapons via scanning items and there being a variety of types of levels led me to loving this game.","Nov 25, 2018 at 2:11 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:55:54.218074,Nameless4Now,Alot of Fun,"Cool concept, scan/pack items to unlock better fire power to kill the onslaught of out of control fruit trying to attack your work station!  Of all the VR games I own, I come back to this one the most!","Sep 27, 2018 at 6:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:55:54.233034,Forbidden76,Amazing fun for whole family,The only VR game my wife and mother gets into! This is well polished and a blast to play! The trailer does not do this game justice (like most VR games).  A fun shooter that is accessible to everyone. Give it a go!,"Sep 3, 2018 at 12:13 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:55:57.361774,Wildt,Polished!,"Such a cute, lovely polished wave shooter with a citrus twist! My biggest grape is that the difficulty in the marathons escalate stupidly slow, so you simply lose focus due to boredom after an hour or so and make stupid mistakes.","Aug 3, 2018 at 2:20 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 13:55:57.427108,BoginDA,Great Buy,"This game beautifully blends facepaced novelty games like Cooking Fever with zombie horde wave survival.  I get bored pretty quickly with either of those genres individually, but when you combine the two its perfect.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters with a twist.","Apr 2, 2018 at 12:49 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 13:56:00.581238,CapriciousKills,Ring 'em up Shoot 'em up,Really fun multitasking game. Scan items and shoot invading fruit. Unlock weapons as you go and try to score three stars on each level. The difficulty progresses with the game which is good. Solid game!,"Jan 27, 2018 at 3:44 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:56:00.596198,DoubleTop,Superb fun with hilarious gameplay,"This game has given hours of entertainment, and will continue to do so once the ""Marathon Challenge"" is unlocked. The loadout of weapons importance to each mission is just right and completing levels is really involving having to perform so many tasks at the same time. Complicated at times, but never loses the fun factor.","Dec 24, 2017 at 8:11 PM",5, 5,
