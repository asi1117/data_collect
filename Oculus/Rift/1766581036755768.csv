2022-05-28 19:33:44.044136,johan.stringer,Gorgeous relaxed views of Mars,"Unfortunately my eyes do not permit seeing 3D effects. But even in 2D these images are gorgeous. If you take time to really observe the high resolution details in each image you can spend many hours watching, even if you don't use the extra textual info, which is actually onle one short phrase per image.
I have some suggestions for improvement (I'me a Unity developer):
1. I find the geological lexicon interesting, but hard on the eyes to view. It would be nicer to highlight terms in the lexicon in the descriptions of each image. When pointing at the highlighted word, the explanation could show in a popup, and/or could be spoken.

2. A push on the thumbstick could let the slideshow auto play, and pause on a second click. This would make for an even more relaxed experience if you don't use the info.

3. Would it be possible to zoom in on the overview map of Mars, centering on the area where the image is taken? If you could gradually zoom in, the context of the images would come to life. Now they are only a very rough indication of the where abouts. This is extra relevant for the images for which the info states that it is located nearby some other geological hotspot.

4. I guess it should be possible to display a map of the region in which the rover(s) travelled, showing the spot from where each surface image was taken and the direction in which the camera was pointing. 

5. The first piece of music seems to endlessly repeat itself.  I would appreciate more variation. And also an in-app volume control would be appreciated.

6. When the info is on, the remarks on the control of the show are handy in the beginning, but distract from the overall experience once I was comfortable with the few controls. It would be nice to let them vanish after a while, or on some button click. Maybe a simple small question mark on floor level could make them visible again?",Dec 3 at 6:27 PM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:33:44.060093,volodoscope,"Bad interaction, can be so much better!","The depth effect is way too much. It makes all photos look unrealistic, while they are real photos of the surface. The 3D ground photos are much better, but there's no way for me to go to a specific photo, or start from where I left off. I have to restart the whole slideshow from the beginning. The other things is the music, it's pretty bad choice to play some spooky sounding instumentals, this is not a Halloween game. I would rather have spacewave or chill sound. There's a lot of improvements that are needed.","Sep 3, 2019 at 10:26 AM",2, 0,"DEPTH: The orbital shots with the exaggerated depth come that way directly from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera as it takes two photos of the same region from different parts of its orbit. On top of that, the perceived depth changes depending on how close you are viewing the image. In the intro area of the app, there is a note about how to make sense of that depth - the White Rock formation in the second photo is actually around 300 meters tall.  It may be exaggerated a bit beyond my control, but Mars is known for its amazingly large geologic structures!

SPECIFIC PHOTO: Try using the favorites feature - you can create a condensed slideshow of the ones you like.

MUSIC: Sorry about the music, was hoping it would be exciting. And well, I suppose it can be a Halloween game if you think about how this is all on another planet, and there's a strong possibility right now that our civilization may not be able to get off this rock to see it in person!

Thanks for giving it a try!"
2022-05-28 19:33:44.077048,Hollywood_TG,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"I'm too old to be in the generation that will walk on Mars, but this is the closest thing to it.  Love the 3D images, would love realistic depth perception, but those dunes are unbelievable!  You don't see anything like that on Earth.  The final scene I just sat there in awe, feeling like I have finally stood on Mars.  Thank you so much to NASA and the incredible Rovers and the team who put this together.  Was every bit as good as going to Kennedy Space Center.","Jun 15, 2019 at 8:42 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:33:44.094002,Pundemonium,Good,"Good idea, good menus, good music, good images, great first person 3D images at the end (Rover perspective) but there are a few cons:
-For some pictures there is no location on the overview map or outside of the range of the map
-For the satellite pics the height of mountains/crater ridges is ridiculously exaggerated
-No overview map for the first person images (if you know by heart which rover went where, you'll still know I guess)
-I'm not sure if the scale is right for the first person images. Obviously the pics are taken from the height of a rover camera which isn't an average human heigth and that feels weird

Still good value for money, especially if you always wanted to feel like you're standing on Mars, the last 360 panorama is awesome","Jun 4, 2019 at 8:56 AM",3, 1,

And if you have a pair of Anaglyph red/blue glasses laying around, can download and view with the  same effect.

I suggest getting a refund instead of leaving a bad review!  Having said that, keep in mind that VR is hands-down the very best way to view stereoscopic photos!  Just as it is the best way to view 3D movies because you're not having to dim your view in the movie theater, etc."
2022-05-28 19:33:47.218250,FastLawyer,Really good 3D stereoscopic slide show,"If you like Mars, this is a must get. Just keep in mind, you're just looking at 3D slides. Lots of slides to look at and the last one is 360 and is magnificent. Whole thing took me a little less than 15 minutes although it depends on how closely you want to look at the slides.","Oct 11, 2018 at 6:23 AM",4, 2,

Nice presentation, I use my own music so I can't speak to the included music.  Beautiful quality and stereo depth, thanks for creating this!","Oct 22, 2018 at 9:28 AM",5, 1,Thank you for the kind words!  Glad you liked it.
2022-05-28 19:33:47.249168,L604,Great views of Mars,"This program displays stereoscopic images of specific locations on Mars. There is a toggle to switch between 2D and 3D images. There is a map to the side that displays where on Mars the image came from. 
This is not a game, but rather a neat tool for anyone who is interested in Mars.
