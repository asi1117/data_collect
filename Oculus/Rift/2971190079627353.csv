2022-05-28 20:36:32.843355,MoreIguanas,Not at all good,"As far as the game, its chess.
As for the UI, its crap. You cant switch hands, the scaling is unpredictable, and theres only 3 ai levels?
Skip this one and find one with better reviews, I wish I had.",Mar 30 at 8:04 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 20:36:32.858314,Premat,A lot less than expected,"The pieces are quite frankly hideous. You cannot change with which hand you move the pieces. You cannot decide how your board looks like or what design your pieces will have. There are 3 Modes and they are 5 min Blitz 30 Min and 50 Min games. The only good thing about this game really is the part where it still is actually chess. I can strongly advise anyone against buying this game. I do not want to be rude to the developers, I am sure a VR game is a lot of work but I am deeply dissatisfied with my experience and if there was a way, I would want a refund!","Sep 21, 2020 at 9:47 PM",1, 14,We're sorry you feel this way! Will take your criticism into account and update the game accordingly.
2022-05-28 20:36:32.873274,jameshuntyhunter,Excellent!,This is definatley not as bad as the reviews made out! the gameplay is excellent no lag or loss of frames throughout without with some cool looking skins to unlock if you can get through the computer. I especially enjoyed the scale button where you can adjust the size of the player. Other than that its just chess (Add more skins and music to unlock!),"Oct 14, 2020 at 1:22 AM",5, 2,
