2022-05-28 19:46:33.388188,Raymii,Lazy effort,"There's a short ""multiple choice"" dialoge with a boy where you cannot really influence the direction of the conversation and where you don't get to know the boy at all. There's camera shaking that makes you VR-sick. And there's an even shorter second scene that ends appruptly while youre trying to figure out what you're supposed to do (nothing, really). The underlying topic is so important and would provide so many possibilitys for an experience that counts, but this experience is wrong on almost every level.","Mar 10, 2018 at 7:44 PM",1, 6,"Hi Raymii,

Thanks for your review. This is the first VR product that came out of our R&D Labs in just one month due to time constraints. Your feedback is really valuable for us to learn from the mistakes. I agree with you on the story as we wrote a full back-story for the kid and tried to integrate it into Blackbox, but we weren't sure if it would bore people or not. We decided to keep the story short, but that kept the interactions minimal."
2022-05-28 19:46:36.509455,Aquavemo,The intent may be good...,"but this was not so much. The conversation with the boy is VERY short. (I would like to know more about him.) Background information is also sparse. And devs please: NEVER use shaking effects in VR! For anyone who is interested in something similar to this, take a look at ""We wait"".","Mar 9, 2018 at 8:17 AM",2, 4,"Hi Aquavemo, thanks for the feedback! This is part of an R&D initiative and meant to be a VR short to get initial feedback on the narrative and approach. Based on the reviews and feedback so far, we now have further validation of our desire to develop the experience beyond a simple VR short. We hope to have more updates in the coming months."
2022-05-28 19:46:36.525413,ProudMinnesotan,Nice but too short,I loved the idea behind Blackbox and the rationale. The experience was well-thought but the story fell short of what I was expecting. It ended pretty quickly and I wasn't really sure what really happened.,"Mar 15, 2018 at 11:44 PM",4, 5,Thank you! We are working on a longer version.
2022-05-28 19:46:36.540878,tubi13,A tragic experience,"I believe it has just become the 7th year of Syrian Civil War and content on this tragedy is laudable. The game itself focuses on that more games/experiences should be made on this topic. I loved the kid and voice acting, but the story was a bit too short","Mar 16, 2018 at 3:24 PM",5, 6,Thank you tubi13!
2022-05-28 19:46:36.555838,FastLawyer,'We wait' by BBC was so much better,So this is a mostly cinematic VR experience that is really short. It ends very abruptly.  It only has two different interactions.  Picking up a ball and throwing it and picking up a form and reading it.  That is it.  There's hardly a story here.  There's a nice visual effect when the rubble falls above you.  Your touch controllers start shaking way too much.  There's just too many sparse details. The narrative was not well fleshed out.  I am sympathetic to the plight of children refugees across the world. But this experience did not help me understand the plight of Syrian children refugees.  It's more confusing than anything else. Way too little of substance happened way too fast.,"Mar 9, 2018 at 8:38 AM",3, 5,
