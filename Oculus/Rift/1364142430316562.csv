But the fees are outrageous in game.
Why should I be paying for fuel?
And sand??? Wtf. No BNSF employees would pay for that stuff. The company pays.
Also I'm being derailed all the time when I should not be.
I was just coming into machine factory/town from city sw. Going under the speed limit in a straight line and have 4 cars derail on me.
Now the fees have made it so I cant progress because o dont have the money to pay the 30k in fees and it won't let me take on new jobs.
Add to the fact that I cant start again or do the job over.
I may have to uninstall and re install to get a fresh start which I have done 2 times.

Ok look. You guys need to overhaul this one more time.",Dec 2 at 5:18 AM,2, 19,
2022-05-28 15:15:58.329961,Stonedoggz,Trains in VR,"I love simulators, especially in VR and this game doesn't disappoint.
It has a nice slow relaxed pace and has some pretty good mechanics such as having to couple trains manually and using turntables and getting the engines serviced.
Be warned though it's not easy, it took me two hours to complete my first job as my little engine couldn't pull it's load up a hill which meant I had to go and find another engine to come and help me deliver the load.
I have only had the game a day but have thoroughly enjoyed it so far, looking forward to getting my next license so I can drive the bigger engines and even a steam train.
Definitely recommend if you like slow paced simulations.","Feb 24, 2021 at 7:02 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 15:15:58.359881,untitledUser,Super Fun Game!,"Have really enjoyed playing so far using oculus link. The tutorial is very clear and gets you into the gameplay quickly. The game is perfect for VR as you get an appreciation of the scale of the locomotives which you don't in a conventional simulator. 

It is really fun to couple the wagons to the locomotive and control everything with the Vr controllers, hit boxes for the control levers could be a bit larger as you have to be quite precise to grab onto them and my friend struggled to know where and how to grab them, Potentially highlighting them like the other interact-able objects upon hover might be helpful in this case. Also, would love to have a multiplayer mode for this game, even if the other player was just a spectator coming for a ride I think this would be cool.

Overall would highly recommend this game, It is already really fun to play and It looks like there is exciting new updates to come in the future. The Derail Valley YouTube series is also really interesting to find out the new features they are adding each week.","Sep 28, 2020 at 2:10 AM",5, 16,

Keep up the good work, I can't wait to see the next installment of this game.","Aug 2, 2020 at 11:16 AM",5, 18,
