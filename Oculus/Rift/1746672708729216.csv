2022-05-28 18:44:18.052301,am1001,Potential is great for this app,"I am giving 5 stars for the potential of this app. Buy it to support development. The basics are frankly great - 3d modeled guitars, piano, drums, synth etc.  They are right to concentrate on the basics and leave the interface simple. The other graphics are poor but they can sort that out later. It needs finger tracking to be totally useful but hopefully coming to rift and not just to quest. The sounds are useful but not great quality. Also vote for strings/brass and woodwind instruments. I think it is already worth £15 even with all the obvious rough edges . Well done so far. Hope you get to develop it to the pro studio quality it needs to get to. One request is to add MIDI support - so we can play instruments and record in DAW.","Feb 17, 2021 at 4:38 AM",5, 4,"Thanks very much for your support and feedback! Unfortunately it's very unlikely Oculus will bring any support for Rift hand-tracking, we are working on Quest port with hand-tracking. Currently converting app to OpenXR format, will have additional finger poses for Rift in that build. Plan to record more samples when we get out of lockdown. On the roadmap to incorporate MIDI, and in talks about a pro version. You can open DASH and use your own DAW within app :)"
2022-05-28 18:44:18.068258,Sinjin48,Patience - None - Possibilities - Some,"While I was really looking for something like Garage Band or something to enable some instant instrument playing gratification, this wasn't for me. It's more for people who know how to play using two fingers or who want to create sounds to mix together. I'm looking for something that will let me just pick up an instrument and feel I'm playing it correctly or light up to show me where/when to hit the strings/keys. May try this again when hand tracking is enabled and I have more time on my hands. Frustrating with the Link -ish cable.  Hope it comes to Quest with all the kinks worked out. Will be killer.","Dec 26, 2020 at 8:55 AM",2, 1,"I am sorry the app didn't suit your instant gratification needs, probably better to try gamified music apps or rhythm slashers. We are concentrating on realistic simulation,  user can learn to play, compose, record and gain actual music knowledge that can be brought to real world instruments. There is only 2 finger tracking for Rift on PC, we are working on full finger tracking for Quest. We are also working on teaching features - already you can load up your own chords or lyrics, compose on a score generator, and all instruments tell you which note you are playing. There are no shortcuts to learning musical instruments (real or virtual), just time, patience and practice! I am sorry you rated so poorly because you expected something else."
2022-05-28 18:44:18.083218,anthonykennethbishop,Needs more instruments and Hand Tracking,"I know don't bite my hand off it's in early access so give it time! So I've been testing this out with my Oculus Quest via the Link Cable when I started using the software the other day and it's amazing but, And I say but because I would love to see loads more Instruments but again with Hand Tracking. It would be awesome to have a violin and have it in my real hands using either Hand tracking or Haptic gloves some time in the future. Ans if Hand tracking came to the pc using the link and a Piano then it'll be a barging of a app to play all types of Music mabe if they had Multi-player to where you could start a band with your oculus friends. Thank you.","May 7, 2020 at 12:26 AM",4, 6,"Thanks for your feedback :) This is the Rift version, the Rift doesn't have any hand-tracking yet, if it did we would be all over it! We are working on a specific Quest port, and have hand-tracking implemented in that version. The app already has way more playable Instruments than any other app, and we do plan to bring more Instruments (Strings and Brass) when time allows and money permits. We hope you can enjoy the existing instruments until the new ones arrive!"
2022-05-28 18:44:18.099176,hilightnotes,"Good effort, marred by core design flaws","What is an instrument? I think it is a tool that we can interface with to produce sound/music.

When I sit down at a piano, even if I've never played before, I can place my fingers on the keys, press, and hear sound. It is fun, tactile, immediately rewarding, engaging, and full of expressive potential. It's not the best interface but it's quite good!

Should we bring that same tried and true interface right into VR?

Well... no. VR is not the same as physical reality. It is a space where we can interface with tools in ways that are probably even more powerful, intuitive, expressive, than reality. But it's different, and requires different design, just like when we started using the computer to make music it required new designs.

When I 'sit down' at a piano in Instrument Studio VR it is not very fun, engaging, tactile, or expressive. I only have two fingers (you can kind of use other fingers but you can't move them where you want, so it's more like playing with one 'branching finger'). No physical feedback. Samples are OK but not programmed well for expressive playing. It's finicky and doesn't always do what you want/expect. 

Instrument Studio VR works for basic recording of specific styles. Drums and guitar work better than the keyboard instruments and you can still get some simple rhythm/melody going. However, I don't think it is a step forward in music creation/performance for VR. Instead of thinking how instruments can be designed to take advantage of the VR interface, it tries to paste real-world interfaces into VR with minimal redesign, or none.

I think the dev was very attached to the idea of bringing a 'real life studio' into VR. I hope that they let go of that real life image and instead think about how a studio COULD look in VR, to best take advantage of the medium and interfacing potential. 

There are also some smaller functionality issues present.

It is a good effort, but not for me. I hope the dev continues to work and pursue their dream.","Dec 6, 2019 at 6:26 AM",2, 17,
2022-05-28 18:44:18.114135,JohnnyDioxin,A Really Fun and Useful Music Tool,"I'm finding this app lots of fun - I can play the piano without having to buy one! It's so much fun. Being a guitarist, I always wonder what it would be like to play something else, and how good I would be at it. Well, so far I'm failing miserably on the drums - but hope I'll get the hang of it soon (love making a racket with them, though!) but I'm doing remarkably well on the keyboards. 
I really want this app mostly for making backing tracks, either for actual songs (the first one I tried was for Pink Floyd's ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" and it worked really well) or just to jam along to. I also couldn't resist doing some rapping once I had that microphone switched on and recording and played it back, whilst standing there, probably looking a right wally, doing all the moves in my hobby room with my Rift on!
Everything is very well explained in the video tutorials and guides that you can play in app, whilst sat at the instrument or equipment being explained. I still don't understand all the ins and outs - not had enough time yet, but when I do, this will be my main go-to for recording tunes, in combination with my BOSS portastudio and my guitars, of course.
As a by-the-by, I tested it with the Index and ""Knuckles"" and it worked perfectly - can't wait to see it, hopefully, on Quest, so I don't have to worry about tangling myself up when I'm doing a Cozy Powell!
Great app - well done! Recommended for musicians and aspiring musicians alike.","Dec 5, 2019 at 4:38 AM",5, 13,We are delighted you are enjoying playing and making music in the app. You have a really great taste in music too! Who cares about looking a wally when you are having so much fun. Thanks for reviewing :)
