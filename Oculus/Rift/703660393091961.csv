2022-05-28 14:59:55.306703,darkesco,Realy Well Thought Out Puzzle Game,"A clean stylized, chalenging, and visually appealing, fun puzzle game. You use orbs to manipulate light beams. This game was free for me, and I can tell you this: If there is a seaquel, I'm buying it! If you put this on the Quest/Quest2 (put it on AppLab if you have to), I will also buy it! I would not have tried this if it were not free, but I am willing to shell out cash now! Take my money! Great job!","Mar 16, 2021 at 12:18 PM",5, 1,Thanks for your kind words!

Nicely done in so many ways! I didn't realise about the constellations until then end and all the way through I was wondering what was with the white dots appearing at times. The main puzzles I found on some a real challenge which is nice, I haven't felt challenged like that in years! I did sneak a few hints from the developers website, it was that or go mad haha.","Sep 30, 2020 at 4:23 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for the fantastic review! Glad you enjoyed yourself.

2022-05-28 14:59:55.367541,Satconcook,Puzzles among puzzles,"Amazing physics game. Technically it can be completed from a seated position, but to get 100% completion you will need to do some moving around. After completing a few puzzles you find there are collectibles, after a few more you find there are secrets. Some levels are certainly more challenging than others. If you like mind bending puzzle games, Bending the Light will do it.","Dec 5, 2019 at 2:41 AM",5, 6,"Yep, you're totally right about the seated thing. You'll need a swivel chair and a lot of leaning/stretching to get the last few constellation puzzles. Oculus doesn't have a ""mostly seated"" category though! Thanks for the kind review."

2022-05-28 14:59:58.526093,Shakagenghis,Truly one of the best VR Experiences!!!,"Relaxing, I highly recommend it.  I would pay 15 bucks for this minimum. VR is perfect for 3d puzzles, and this is a gem that fits perfectly into my collection. No motion sickness, just this atmospheric puzzle set, trippy, looks a little like tron maybe. You are manipulating gravity with orbs, reflecting light with mirrors, and trying to make sense of it all.   Also, hard to complete.  I have most of it done, but there are these puzzles hidden inside of the puzzles. You will see.  Buy it, just perfect to show people that are new to VR.  Everyone should know about this title, hope it gains more traction.  I would say that the atmospheric feeling of the game is close to Form, but gameplay is longer and not story driven.","Apr 3, 2020 at 12:02 AM",5, 1,Thanks for the kind words!
2022-05-28 14:59:58.541053,damu_oculus,Awesome!,"Awesome!
The game recommends playing it while sitting, but I found standing to be better and it's really cool to move around the scene.
More levels would be nice, I finished most in my first session which was around an hour.
Also there was one level with a rotating kinda cylinder where the particles spread in a giant fan which had a lot of mirrors and two discs which filter / slow down particles. I cheesed it by just redirecting the beams with just one mirror each before they hit the spinning thing. No idea how it is supposed to be finished.","Aug 25, 2019 at 5:30 PM",5, 5,"Thanks for the kind review! As the author I don't really mind if you cheese some of the levels. If you're smart enough to discover an easy way, feel free to use that! In that level you describe, you're not meant to be able to reach the mirror that redirects the particles from sitting, but if your setup allows you to get to them, go for it!

Are you sure you've found everything the game has to offer? 1 hour seems a little short to me. Rewatch the trailer and see if there's any bits you've missed."
2022-05-28 14:59:58.556013,Xiarea,An excellent puzzle game,"Very easy to learn, very pleasant to play. I wish it was possible to teleport to explor the puzzles while sitting, but they are small enough that I can walk around them in my office. 
I am stuck at 99% completion however. I can't find the constellation on ""defiance"". I feel like I tried everything, I don't know what I am missing... Any clue on how to have the stars appear?

Update: I am not sure what I did, but I found my stars after a few more tries :)

I add an awsome time playing this game!","Sep 1, 2019 at 1:02 PM",5, 0,"Thanks for the kind review! In Defiance, it's all about collecting the atoms fast after the first one."
2022-05-28 15:00:01.684645,uno.aphex,"Woah, just..woah","I am already completely hooked on this game, the concept alone caught my attention but then I started playing it and was even more enthusiastic about it after that. I feel like you give us tools to solve a puzzle but there are a few ways to complete each level depending on your creativity  I don't know if that was your intention or if you purposely designed it with tangible solutions in mind but I feel like I am somewhat in control of how the puzzles are executed and there seems to be a lot of content and this game is free? Really? I've paid money for garbage vr games before and this is just magnificent.  If I could reach through my computer monitor and shower you with hugs I would but this review might just be the next best thing. I hope you succeed in life. I really do.

Edit - Seriously confused as to where the atoms are on Nexus and the last atom on Tear it down, I've been trying to figure this out for ages can you please drop the smallest hint? I've tried extrapolating clues from any source I could possibly find and I've come up short, I've tried deducing maybe the level names being a clue as to what to do or maybe the layout of the level but I am finding no correlation of clues for what I'm supposed to do on Nexus and No idea where the last atom is on Tear it down. Any help appreciated, I don't want answers just the smallest..tiniest bread crumb possibly..please?","Sep 2, 2019 at 5:44 AM",5, 0,"Edit: For Nexus, try completing the constellation again. The atoms should appear after you've done that. For Tear it Down, try directing a beam under the platform to destroy the structure that sticks out there... Not sure if I've already helped you, but that should get you through!

Original: Thanks for your kind words. Each level does have an intended solution, but if you can do it in another way that's fine too. I like that kind of flexibility, and I think players do to. It's only free for a limited period. Not sure if you get to keep it forever if you get it in a free period or not, but it pretty much dropped off to zero sales anyway, so it's good to experiment."

2022-05-28 15:00:04.921986,RuneSR2,A must-have for the Rift!,"I've known about this game for long, but I never considered buying it - maybe it looked too simple, but I was so wrong. The quality of this game is truly magnificent, on my GTX 1080 the game runs flawlessly at 90 fps using super sampling 2.0 and highest in-game setting. And it's a truly beautiful game with great attention to textures and details, and the game will probably perform perfectly even on low-end rigs.
The game does require some cognitive skills, and some levels are difficult to complete, but it's great fun. Both kids and adults can learn about physics - and solves fun riddles - in this superb game. Congrats to the devs for making such an original, creative and astonishing game!
It's an experience best enjoyed sitting and Touch support is perfectly implemented. Actually I can't find anything wrong with this game! :-)","Oct 15, 2018 at 6:13 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for your kind review! I'm glad you took the time and effort to try it for yourself. 2D screenshots/videos don't really do it justice, but that's the same problem all VR titles have. That's the same for headset manufacturers too - until you try it, you don't really know what VR has to offer."
2022-05-28 15:00:08.047626,eike42,Awesome game - more than you think,"What starts as a nice, smooth relaxing game where you can experiment with light and enjoy the easy puzzles, ends with really tough (but manageble) puzzle that leave you totally satisfied when you finish them all. We played it with two persons, one with the Rift and one on the monitor, and had 3 days and nights of fun and excitement. If you are into puzzling, this is great for you.
Special thanks to the developer who helped us out on one puzzle (which we could have solved, if we weren't so blind!) so we could reach completion.","Sep 22, 2018 at 5:12 PM",5, 5,"Thanks for your kind review! Don't feel bad about the one you couldn't get by yourself, that's one that a lot of people struggle with. You got all the other tricky ones though. You should feel proud of yourselves!"
2022-05-28 15:00:08.063583,SwashBlade,A generally fun and innovative puzzler,"The core puzzle component of this game, the manipulation of light beams, is quite enjoyable.  There are around 40 levels at what looks to be a decent difficulty curve, giving you simple tools with which to reflect, curve and duplicate the beams of light in complicated ways.  It's the completionist puzzles - atom collection and constellation join-the-dots - that let the experience down.  

Where the majority of the game is a comfortable, seated experience - indeed, one of the very first things the game tells you to do is sit down - finding the collectables and completing the constellations hidden in each puzzle requires standing up, crawling around and everything in between.  The collectables are quite deviously hidden, at times requiring a beam of light to be directed to a particular non-goal area before they will appear.  That part of it is good fun.  The problems start when a piece is under or behind the puzzle.  

The constellations puzzles are let down by some odd design choices.  They're started by looking at dots that appear in the background of the puzzles at which point another dot will appear to show where you're looking, though at times it seems to completely fail to appear making it impossible to start that particular aspect of the puzzle.  Once you bring your gaze dot in contact with one of the stars a line will be projected from somewhere to the left and below your left eye which you have to keep from intersecting with any objects - quite a task when its position makes depth perception difficult.  Add to that the way some of the dots are in between pillars and seem to require you to walk through the puzzle in order to solve it and you've got something that feels like it throws away all VR conventions just so the puzzles aren't a cakewalk.

I have enjoyed the base puzzles so far.  I just don't think I have the tolerance for frustration required to engage in my normal completionist ways for this title.","Aug 18, 2018 at 12:26 AM",3, 2,"Very fair review, thanks! I wanted to make a game where the puzzles took advantage of VR's unique ability to move around physically in a space. It started as a concept on the DK2, then the CV1 and then the CV1 with added touch controls, so it still has some design elements that hark back to those days. You can do most of it seated on an office style wheelie chair (with a fair bit of leaning), but a few puzzles do require you to physically get out of the chair!"
2022-05-28 15:00:08.079541,thoiter,Surprised me.,"This is a perfect example of a game being much better in virtual reality than it's 2D trailer might suggest, to me at least.  It's an excellent puzzle game with intuitive controls and high quality visuals that really comes to life in VR.","Sep 3, 2018 at 5:25 AM",5, 0,"Thanks for your kind words.

2022-05-28 15:00:11.188226,SparkyNinja1583,Masterpiece,"Wow. This puzzle game blew me away. If you've been browsing reviews you may have stumbled upon a 2 star review where the player says there's not a lot of content and some of the puzzles can be cheated. The developer's response is on point. Without giving anything away here let me just say that there is more to this game that meats the eye. I just achieved 100% completion and I feel very acomplished, satified and overjoyed with this title. Would definitely buy a VR title from these guys again!

One disclaimer i should mention is that if you do want to go for the 100% completion you will need some space. I don't think it's possible to do everything sitting down.

Well done, developers! A+","Jun 11, 2018 at 10:21 AM",5, 7,"Thank you for your kind and well considered review. Also congratulations on 100% completion of the game. Not easy! I think you're right by the way about stretching the definition of ""seated play"" for 100% completion!"

These days everything is SUPER ACTION PACKED TURBO OVERDRIVE!! and this game is an amazing break from that. I am so happy this was on sale or I would never of found it. I would totally buy DLC for this game if it came out. If you like to chill and solve puzzles, this is the game for you.","May 27, 2018 at 1:25 AM",5, 3,"Thanks for the kind review. Probably won't release any DLC for it, but have you tried the VR game Form? It's pretty similar in a lot of ways. Better presented, perhaps not as much gameplay variation."

Well done creating this game!","Jan 27, 2018 at 10:44 PM",5, 3,"Thank you for your kind review, and congratulations for making it right to the end! Certainly not an easy feat. The layers of revelation and discovery in The Witness were absolutely the inspiration for the structure of Bending the Light.

2022-05-28 15:00:17.509319,BrandonSoMD,Splendid game multi levels of complexity,"This game was a lot of fun. There were several levels of complexity that I missed at first but were required to finish. Each one was a joy to discover, although a bit of a grind at first. Be aware that to fully complete it you need a fairly large amount of space - sitting in a chair won't do it. You can finish one aspect but others require a fair amount of physical movement (not speed, more of precision). My only real complaint is that the only way to move the viewpoint as required to achieve a goal was to reposition myself in my playing space, then click the recenter button. Having a control to slide or move my viewpoint would have been MUCH preferable. But otherwise, a wonderful experience.","Dec 30, 2017 at 9:10 AM",5, 3,"Thank you for your kind review, and well done for finishing! The game was developed in a fairly compact VR space measuring 2.4m x 2.4m (a little under 8ft x 8ft). Every element should be solvable just by centring yourself within this space. I'd be interested to hear any specific parts you couldn't solve without using the recentre function, as they may need a little adjustment.

I guess that I have been ""flat-world"" gaming for too long. Thinking in 3d is still not normal, when gaming, for me. I have a struggle with thoughts in 2d. This is the game that brings it to the forefront. This is a well put together puzzle game and forces one to think differently. I am an older adult and this game is making a new connection in my brain. You CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Thank you for this. I implore you to buy and play this game, as I think the puzzle solving in 3d may help real world situations. Open your mind to something new. The quality is apparent.

After a little while you find more puzzles to solve and then some more and then even more. Great concept.

Similar to Landfall, Defence-Grid 2, and Blaze Rush, it's really table-top size which I so happen to love.  Ambient music, simple and intricate scenes, easy learning curb, well done level interface, captivating lighting effects, and trinkets to find along the way make this fun game really great to relax and chill-out to.

2022-05-28 15:00:20.706768,Fong74,Chilly puzzle game,"I love puzzle games, I like physics based ones either and I love VR. This one brings those aspects together. Sure, there could be more puzzles, but for 7 bucks (sale price) its pretty much ok for me. As some other reviewer said: another gem in this store. More of this please!","Nov 5, 2017 at 2:05 AM",5, 3,Thanks for your kind words! Glad you enjoyed the game.

2022-05-28 15:00:23.836397,PerfectlyCooked,Cool idea... but not quite worth the $$,"This game has a lot of time put into development, it's obvious. However, I feel like there wasn't a whole lot of actual play-testing done.
1. many of the levels can be ""cheated"" by taking advantage of the reset position and walking around, as well as just holding things in place.
2. There seems to be no hint of increasing difficulty. It seems absolutely random - both the puzzle difficulty as well as the puzzle concepts and features.
It seems like the hardest part of this entire game was trying to precisely aim the ""light cannons"" because even when you use the thumbstick they rotate on a plane 90 degrees opposite the direction of the stick, and on top of that it's still really touchy because the stick is analog output. I found myself wishing for just some long rigid ""tails"" to be put on the rear end of the cannon so I could pivot them from further away from their fulcrum.
3.The last two levels. The first one is the epitome of the ""aligning the cannons"" issue I just mentioned, because once you see it you know exactly what to do but it still takes several minutes and quite a bit of frustration. The second one made me feel like I absolutely wasted my time. They not only introduce what seems to be a new concept on the last level, but it's extremely obvious and you then proceed to do the exact same thing two more times - that's the final level.
Most puzzle game players would expect that the FINAL LEVEL (for christ's sake) might apply all their previously hard-earned knowledge of game mechanics, it'd be big, challenging, rewarding, but no, it's just a simple puzzle that could've been solved right after you finish the first tutorial levels... I beat the game in under 2 hours, felt aggravated, refunded it, then repurchased it just to make this review after seeing the other reviews. Sure this would be great for older people new to VR, but not someone who is experienced in both VR and puzzle games. Absolutely cool idea, but just like most games on the Rift - hastily sent out.","Oct 12, 2017 at 6:41 PM",2, 6,"Sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the game. I think you may have missed some pretty big parts of it however. What percentage completion did you achieve? At the time of writing, the stats show that nobody at all has completed the game so far. I suspect you haven't discovered the actual final two puzzles yet, or potentially the 40 or so that lead up to them! Feel free to contact games@deeperbeige.com if you'd like to discuss more. As for rotating objects, you can do exactly what you are asking for already - grab a rotatable item, pull away from it and you'll have your longer tail to manipulate it with."
