2022-05-28 19:24:06.076192,OversizeWizard,Nice looking,"Great looking game, just don't like the shooting using the right stick.
Gun needs to be on buttons.

But nice old fashioned arcade.

Hope we get better shooting control and maybe zoom in first person view","May 23, 2020 at 12:09 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:24:06.091152,RocketWorld26,Can't get started!?  ...ok got it!,"It just keeps telling me to unlock weapons before I can even use a gun.  How on earth do you unlock weapons???  I am just selecting the pistol.    ANSWER: Okay I figured it out.  Think ""robotron"".  The left thumb stick moves and the right one shoots.  I was pulling the trigger on the right expecting to fire a gun; like you would think a cowboy game would work.  So...I love the idea of the game and it is a great start, but the aiming is diffficult (I found it easier to shoot in one direction and then move the man back and forth rather than aim the shots).  Less than intuative interface.  BUT, well workth 2$ and I am very much hoping for updates in the near future.","Oct 12, 2019 at 8:50 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:24:06.106112,DAN_di_WARhol,,"Pretty basic. Despite progressing, every level appears exactly the same. 

I would like to see some variety in missions. Perhaps some stealth, bank jobs etc.","Jul 15, 2019 at 8:19 PM",2, 0,
