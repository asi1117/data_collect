2022-05-28 17:44:28.848111,Cullinarn,Beautiful with Phenomenal Tech Support,"This has to be the third or fourth time I've updated this review. I had an isolated issue with one of the destinations failing to load recently, so I submitted a ticket to tech support. Given that vTime is five years old, at this point, I wasn't really expecting much to come of it. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a reply with questions about the issue within a couple of hours, and tech support fixed the problem in a very timely fashion. There is a lot to love about vTime. It is still one of the most beautiful apps out there, managing to provide a variety of well-designed environments while only requiring a modest amount of storage space. It's a place where you can take a short vacation on one of two beaches, take in a sunset, pretend you're riding to Hogwarts on a train, fly in a Private Jet, sit on an ice block in Antarctica, drink your coffee in Paris, and experience so many other beautiful spaces and places. I can now add phenomenal tech support to the reasons I love this experience. Oh. You can chat on it too. ;)","May 21, 2020 at 6:51 PM",5, 6,Thanks for your review! We're really happy we could help.

Edit:  Dev responded below.  My rebuttal is, ""Then why don't you say it's optional on the form?  It's presented as if there's no other option but to provide the asked-for information.""","Feb 21, 2019 at 10:21 PM",1, 5,"Hey DoubleShot. That permission is optional and we don't use it to get your contacts. We use it to get your email address so you don't have to type it in VR and we don't store it.

I checked today and all my favourites destinations have gone. The Paris rooftop, the beach at sunset, the cave in the winter, all gone. They haven't even been replaced by anything. I understand wanting to add in more rooms but why remove the existing ones? My friend and I that are 300 miles apart used this to hang out and chat, looks like we need a new place, so disappointing and uncomprehendable!","Oct 11, 2018 at 7:16 PM",1, 12,"Sorry to hear that you're unhappy with the recent changes. None of the destinations have gone for good. Instead, we’re trying something different. From now on, we’ll be mixing up the destinations that are on offer regularly, so you’ll see all of your favourites again as well as new and seasonal ones! We’ve just added in new seasonal destination Abandoned Hope."
2022-05-28 17:44:35.209098,Painful_Secrets,"It ""WAS"" 5 stars but wtf","When I tried Vtime for the first time I was floored and amazed at how simple it was to create an avatar and join a group and start making new friends. I enjoyed it so much I started bugging everyone I knew to get it on their phones and rifts! But then the update came...and they got rid of all the good rooms and everyones volumn was so high it was distorted. In my group of friends we had Canadians who loved the artic themed room, harry potter fans who LOVED the train car theme, and an avid outdoorsman who thought the starry night theme was the bomb. Now...when I go into Vtime there is barely anyone online, and all my friends are gone because who wants to sit in only a couple of rooms. Boring :( This was 5 stars but now I'm afraid its dropped to a 2. I don't think I will use it much anymore when the only people online seems to be the ones trying to learn english and dont talk back. If you build it they will come! Bring back those awesome rooms!!!","Sep 27, 2018 at 1:44 PM",2, 17,"Hello! Sorry to hear that you're not happy with our recent changes. None of the destinations have gone for good as we'll be changing the destinations on offer regularly, as well as adding in new ones.

2022-05-28 17:44:44.709687,fps_rawb,Not too shabby,"vtime reminds me of imvu the flat panel social application thats been around for years, Simple and easy to use built with small group dialog in mind. Could use some more conversation sparking interactive elements (minigames collaboration), your experiance is going to be highly defined by who you end up interacting with as with any chat program.. Had some great discussions on here.

Pros+
-Cross platform (a must for social vr experiances)
-Small filespace footprint (enviroments are like 100mb a piece)
-audio and the voice chat seem to work flawless
-graphics are a+ considering it works on smartphone face devices                                                                                    

Cons-
-No touch menu interaciton for rift (headtracking and button press ui)(arm tracking does work)
-No personal rooms or room customization
-Very limited customization in the clothes department
-small userbase (but existant and active)
-no enviroment interaction 
-4 person room occupancy is abit limiting (suggestion 2-12 host defined by host)","Dec 4, 2017 at 1:48 AM",4, 0,

Anyway, back to the app.,  I would still like to see improvements to the avatar's, like more realistic hair maybe with hair textures, instead of just a block on top of your head.  Other textures on the avatar and clothes could be improved, and the colors are still too vivid.  Maybe you could increase the range of movement a little more, and be able to stand up. Support for Rift and Vive hand controllers, a big improvement.","Jul 28, 2017 at 1:42 AM",4, 1,
