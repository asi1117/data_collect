It took a while to get the controls under my belt, but once you do this game has it all. you can even teleport outside the game construct : in not sure if this is a bug or a kewl cheat, but it's kewl all the same. the game is also beautiful.

2022-05-28 18:30:36.919029,Fortunatus13,Good foundation,"This game is a lot of fun, but it's definitely a bit flawed. My biggest complaint is the writing. I'm sorry, but it is so incredibly amateurish. When the writing meets the awkward lead voice actor it leads to a cringe-fest that has me wanting to turn off the sound all-together. I stopped picking up the journals scattered around. They are supposed to be written by scientists, but they sound like a high schooler's secret diary. 

So yeah, writing is awful, which is a shame because the shooting is a lot of fun. It can get a bit same-y, but most VR is like that so I'm not too critical about that. The way bits of the robots strip away as you fill them with lead is satisfying. Yeah, it's really difficult to grab things off the ground, and melee seems like an afterthought, but overall it's a good game and you should probably add it to your collection. Not too scary either, which is a good thing for me. I'm here to shoot, not to anticipate jumpscares.","Apr 15, 2020 at 6:05 AM",3, 14,

I go to the cave section and where you have to put gas into the auto guns and skip the huge fight i messed up and used all my ammo to get thru, after carring the gas can past all the guys lol,  but did it, right after that i got into the big room with a door left a door right and a Huge truck in the middle, i took the ""find release"" way to the right and after pulling it twice i got the narrator scene and kept going, but I died where you meet the exploding guys for the first time.
Now it took me almost if not all the way back to the beginning of that level, the thing is it has almost no guys to fight now, like it remembers me going through, and when i pull the lever nothing happens and it keeps asking me to ""find release"" in the background when i leave the room.

2022-05-28 18:30:40.062621,PitViper1,Updated review,"I had thought that the game had been abandoned by the developers, however, as the response below shows, I was wrong. I enjoyed playing this game. Good sound and graphics, good weapons. My only real niggle is that there is no option to save or load from different points in the game. That said there are however regular checkpoints that save at predetermined points. It might just be a one off but these worked fine up to a certain point in the game, after which whenever I get past a certain point no matter how far I progressed I would always return to the same checkpoint. Not wanting to give too much away about saying at what point because I dont want to spoil the game for others but I would be glad to provide more detail to the developers by email.","Dec 10, 2019 at 4:03 AM",3, 10,"Hi PitViper,

the game has not been abandoned at all!
on the exact contrary, we have very recently issued a big update with two more chapters added that are available for play in the now full-length story mode!


the saving system is not working like you can save on whatever point you want, but there are certain checkpoints if you pass then you will get back to if you would die. 
have you encountered any bugs with this with playing the latest build? if so, then please be so kind to write where this exactly happened! as we are looking to push out the full release of the game soon this would help a lot if you can tell us all the details you can about any existing bug that we would gladly fix before pushing the full release live!
edit:
it would be much appreciated if you sent an email to info@xrealgames.com , so if the bug does exist then we could fix this in the next update

waiting for your kind reply.

have looked and dont see any, The game has potential to be a lot of fun if I could get out of the begining. The totorial is not complete. The info is lacking.
I know the wepons are susposed to load when you put your guns down by your holster. It dosnt work that way for me.

I do not really understand what your issue is. 
You can reload all type of guns in your hand by moving them close to your holsters on your hip. 
Have you played the story mode? Or is it the swarm mode that you are playing with?
In the former there are automatic checkpoints that save your progress, in the latter there is no saving except your high scores as you just always play the mode until you finally cannot hold anymore and die.

That was just on quick match if i actually go into the room and try to select a differnt match the game just crashed and even after closing the app in the headset the game was still frozen on my monitor screen, i had to alt/ctrl/del to stop the game so im uninstalling wast of money wish id tested it within my two week refund time :-(...","Jul 19, 2018 at 4:22 AM",1, 1,"Hi ryangardner5457,
I am sorry you did not like the experience. Usually our players love the movement options we have as we have options for all needs (I think you did not open options at all where you could have chose any movement option you want; I think the one you really missed is the smooth turn which is there to select too). 
Also, you do not need to utilize the newly improved weapon selector if you do not feel like it, you can holster the weapons and take the new ones instead.
We are aware of that AI is not the strongest point of the game atm, so we are already working on this matter, AI improvements will be coming soon in an update. 
We did not have any crashes or any feedbacks about crashes lately, so it might be a local problem.

2022-05-28 18:30:52.757666,SkylerWaffle,Honest criticism,"If you're looking at this game, you're probably looking at DOOM VFR too and you're probably looking through the reviews to figure out the differences in the games; here's all the awesome stuff you can do.

-Free locomotion, teleportation, and freelook rotation (simultaneously too!)
-Dual wield any weapons
-Chuck empty weapons at enemies (they explode on impact)
-Store weapons and grenades on your belt
-Pickup weapons and a couple powerups from environment
-Melee weapons (although limited)

The game is super fun to play in quick bursts, especially the horde mode.  There are some pretty glaring issues though.

-Level design isn't very good
-Enemy AI is poor
-Enemies in general are lacking visually and have bad animations
-The enemies that shoot you with guns feel super cheap to fight against when you're trying to kill the ones that run right at you

Game is still fun though.  Just wish enemies were better.","Jun 26, 2018 at 2:23 AM",4, 11,

It starts out really atmospheric and even kind of scary.
But after the first level the game just throws dozens of enemy's at the same time breaking any kind of atmosphere it used to have.
I think the dev did this to hide the terrible enemy ai that just walks at you (even the ones holding the guns) 
It just looks like a mess of npc's. 
I think the game gets a lot of praise because its in VR but imagining playing it on a normal monitor would fit this game in the Steam shovel ware catagory.

It isnt offensive in anyway but it's in no way good/great.","Jun 20, 2018 at 9:44 PM",2, 1,"Hi Xampert,

congrats i think you did it better and it works. ok story mode i like it but i feel there is a coupla areas it could use some polish but overall i liked it. lil things i noticed your giant big bads seem enemy types seem to take alot of damage but arnt an actual threat they kinda just growl at you when they miss or take damage.
the second thing to mention is your horde mode reloading your guns like in the campaign does not work. instead what ever gun you use you have to holster it and then un holster it to reload also to get ammo you have to create a pile of the same gun to fill your ammo stores of a certain weapon type. by repetitively pulling the same gun iff the wall. other than that i really enjoyed it. i would like to see more competitive aspects added to the game and maybe coop horde if its improved  but i totally drop some extra cash to see this game reach doom levels of good i think it has a lot of potential .","Jun 9, 2018 at 5:08 PM",5, 1,

The graphics are fantastic I think, 5 stars there, the bloody mess of the aftermath of some kind of attack on the scientists working in the facility reminds you of Doom and/or Half-life, and the carnage and scenes of destruction are believable.  Fire looks pretty good and enemy body parts flop around realistically.  The weapons are also great!  Aiming actually does work: I can take my time sometimes as these creatures shamble, rush and run at me and use my sights on the pistol and pop off headshots reliably to save assault rifle ammo, then I can ""shoulder"" the assault rifle and engage enemies with guns from around/behind cover, and I can use akimbo shotguns to sweep a smaller room flat.  Enemies will still surprise you at times, and the dialogue with your ""assistant"" is pretty witty and funny, that keeps it fresh.  I want to knock half a star for some bugs I found in some hidden areas, where there was bad lagging and the only part of the game that wasn't smooth, but since it's still labeled Early Access I'll leave it at 5 stars.

Thank you so much for taking your time for the review and I am really glad you like the game itself!
Regarding your problem, the FPS drop can be because of two reasons (or maybe both adding on together):
1. NVIDIA cards are always better for gaming (especially for our title as we use Unreal Engine that works best with NVIDIA)
2. Unfortunately our latest build is not perfect regarding its performance. However, we will release the newest build with a lot of new features and fixes on 6th June and of course the performance will be really boosted a lot too, so hopefully it will work much better for you after that time. 

I kindly ask for your patience for about a week from now.

2022-05-28 18:30:59.118653,Slick1984,Good game for under $15,"Superluminal said it best. Although, I might add DEAD EFFECT 2, as well. The game looks good, plays well (for the most part) and gets hectic at times. In a way, it reminds me of Arizona Sunshine, too. Slower exploritory areas and then you'll stumble upon an area chock full of monsters. I guess you could say that this game borrows ideas from other games. Not a bad idea really. You'll feel comfortable with the controls. Smooth movement didn't make me sick. There are movement choices in the menu options. The monsters are difficult to kill. They take a few to several pistol shots. Even blowing their heads off doesn't stop them. This is a 360 game. You'll die a lot to start, but you'll learn what to expect and how to deal with it. There does seem to be a lot of ammo lying around, but I did run into a few places where I didn't have enough. Bugs - I did stutter in a dark passageway (room or hall, it was dark). Also, the first shotgun that I found, I dropped and lost it forever, it vanished. Some headshots may not have registered. The shotgun, machinegun combo is wonderful, BTW.

I am sorry if you did not have a good experience just yet, although I am curious about how far you could proceed in the story mode. We have 3 full chapters (each one of them takes about an hour to play through) to play with the 4th coming in a few weeks form now, and each chapter has quite a different mood, level design and gameplay. I really hope the next chapters will provide you more fun if you did not find the first one satisfying/fast enough for you.

Good game .. lots of detail in art work, the sound side dose still need more work on, ok for now as it is an early reliese and very much would be awesome as a muiltplayer game too, not seen any bug like shutter or lag or skipping, one thing i dont like at all is how you turn, the use of buttons not a good idea from my point, you should allow an option to change that to joystick, as i'm very much more use to that type of game movement, but overall a good game to play when you got use to how it moves, very much worth buying and having a go, i think they are on to a winner, if you like type zombies fps style games this will give you just that , enjoy :)","Apr 25, 2018 at 11:02 PM",5, 2,

Why not add shoulder holsters so you can carry more guns it's a pain when you have 3 types of ammo in your belt but can only holster 2 guns. The guns have a habit of dissapearing when you drop one to pick up ammo If these suggestions where to be implimented I would raise my rating to 5 stars. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE to my review thank you for your reply A-Tech Devs. The movement is now excellent smooth locomotion with smooth or snap turn on the joy stick now :-) I prefer the smooth turn my self but the options are there now much more emersive and much more playable I love the telekenesis picking up weapons it's great when you can't get to a weapon fast enough and still early access so there are going to be a few bugs for some but for me everything works great and runs smooth fantastic game  I highly recommend this game if you like intense fun and emersive shooters well done devs your doing a great job and listening to your players.

2022-05-28 18:31:08.624229,SSJBardock,Killing Floor with a story,"So, I liked the dude in my head. He is funny. He reminds me of John De Lancie. 
I liked the shooting mechanics. They are great. I like multiple weapons, dual wield, and interaction methods; they are well done.
Improvements that can be made:
+  Too Much ammo.. No constriction and no need for me to hold back. I picked up 2 pistols and hosltered them. Then I picked up 2 more pistols. I shot them out, tossed them like garbage, and then whipped out my holstered pistols. 2 free clips. 
Was fun, but then I shot myself out of style quick. I had too much ammo everywhere and felt like I could not take it with me so I was determined to pick up and toss every ammo box I could into the next hall, because I could not go back. 
+T The AR and shotgun were powerful and easy to use, making them effective, but with 3 assault rifles in my hands and holster, with a sidearm on the left, I tore through things silly-quick.

I don't know if it was to have a horror element, then constrict the ammo and the usage in Single Player... make the player feel like every bullet counts..
If it was shoot em up with wild abandon, increase the pouch count, because that was silly. I had 9-10 ammo boxes on the floor and had full ammo. 
+The tutorial needed to be fleshed out a little more. I thought the armor was a flash grenade or phospherous grenade... I tried to toss them.  While I figured out the frag grenade easy, it would be nice to have a place to play around and practice the arc. Make a training room where the player can access the materials in the game to familarize with VR.
+The side to side locomotion of turning is annoying. Allow the right stick to be freemotion. There are many games that allow that because the point and click crap is disorienting. I want to be able to select 1 of 3 control schemes. Full locomotion with both sticks to move like an xbox controller, head and legs.. Partial locomotion with 45 degree turning, and point and click to move.
+I got telefragged a few times in the dark.","Mar 28, 2018 at 2:01 PM",3, 4,

You can use both teleportation and free movements controls without touching the settings, which is really handy. But at certain points (large open rooms with a few enemies) the game seems to drop frames constantly. Even at medium settings with FXAA on and 0.8 % resolution the game drops constantly at certain points on my gtx 1080, it looks as if it could be as low as 30 fps at times, this seems to happen for a few minutes at a time when there are lots of zombies to render. It's not so bad that the game is unplayable, but I imagine it could hinder some people's experience. Hope this gets patched as a gtx 1080 is clearly enough to run this game at the oculus's 1200p screen.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update: Tried benchmarking the game with the oculus debug tool with virtually nothing else running on my pc and the game is still dropping to 45 fps and even 30 fps in certain more demanding areas. Again this is with my gtx 1080 and medium settings.","Mar 5, 2018 at 4:32 PM",3, 4,"Hi jamyjet,
Thank you very much for taking the time for the review. 
The performance of our title is usually really good (even runs very well on gtx 970 too), so here is what I suggest you to solve the lag problem:
1. turn off everything on your computer that can take from its performance (eg. spotify and even the web browsers too). You can use your task manager as a tool, so it shows you everything what is to be turned off
2. if you are using Windows 10 then be sure to turn off the screen capture - 'record game in background' feature as that one really takes a lot of performance. 

I really think and hope this should solve your issue. 

Please, let me know how it went. If the lag still occurs after doing the pieces of advice written above then I am happy to manage you with further assistance via chat or a call. 

Kindest regards,

update:
Firstly thank you for your fast response. My first thought was also this is a graphical driver problem so nvidia drivers was updated from 390.77 to 391.01. Oculus drivers is up to date 1.24.0.539259(1.24.0539539). Unfortunately the problem hasn't been solved. I have sent a bugreport to your site as well.
update2: Koszonom a segitseget!

Thank you for letting us know your issue.
I am pretty sure it happens because of a driver issue on your end (the very same thing happened to me one time after trying to launch another app) and you would experience the same issue when trying to launch other apps at the moment.
So, here is what I suggest you to do to solve this:
1. restart the PC
2. please update all drivers
3. start oculus framework app
4. start game

2022-05-28 18:31:14.903434,PoolfanVr,Best FPS in VR,"Was excited to play this as although I really liked RoboRecall I always felt that teleporting for movement is a little but of a turn off.   It takes the instinctiveness out of the game play.    Enter A-Tech an although you will need to spend time before the controls become intuitive, you will find that when you do the game feels very much like DOOM in VR with similar atmospehere and gameplay.

The weapons are great and the zombies come thick and fast -  if anything they are a little too easy to wipe out, right up to the point you run out of ammo (you have to keep a real eye on that). So you must ensure you reload often and pick up al the ammo you can.

My only criticism is that I often found I reach down to get my gun from the holster and then it is not there.  This is not a bug - it is just easy to get confused and drop your weapon somewhere and not realise.  But this in contrast to Doom where you can press buttons 1 to 9 to switch weapons where here you have to think about reholstering and which holster to use - dropping a weapon before picking up another etc.

The development team deserve real credit being able to allow smooth movement throughout the environment - I recomment use smooth turn instead of snap to turn which works much better.  Overall a cracking game, great fun and a real achievement in the development of VR","Mar 6, 2018 at 4:04 AM",5, 7,

From the Ouculus Support Team : 

""If you are using an Nvidia GPU and currently experiencing display or performance issues with your Oculus Rift, please make sure you're using driver version 388.59. Later versions may cause compatibility issues with Oculus software.""

Kindest regards,
The A-Tech developer

Could you finally run the game after downloading the latest update for the Oculus driver? 
Kindest regards,
