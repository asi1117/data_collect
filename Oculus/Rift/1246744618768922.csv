 • Interaction > you grab nothing, just a simple grab animation where you really feel you've got an object in the hand, wouldn't have take longer in dev, but it would have been far more greater for the user experience

I've been playing VR for a few months and decided to try this out. I found the controls and movement to be clunky and my character would randomly move away from the grab point as I was holding on to them. You're stuck in a 180degree viewing bubble. 

Imagine this as a Disney World ride along where you just kinda exist while things happen around you and you interact a little.

For the sake of adding info, I didn't complete the game. I died at the end where I was supposed to get back to the ship. Once it spit me back in the beginning I found it not worth my time to try again.

First of all, you need to successfully steer back to the ISS on your own to save yourself. The people who say that they die at the end clearly did not beat the challenge.

I like the spacewalk and interactive nature of it all, I like the fact that there's some interaction b/w yourself and your EVA partner.  But the controls are clunky at best when hand-holding around the ISS, and don't even get me effing started when you go tumbling.

I get this is a cheap/free app; but holy hell, how hard would it be to include JUST ONE clickable link explaining the BASICS of manouvering in space??  There's literally nothing in the ""Real Astronaut"" mode, and in the beginner mode it's just ""Point your hands at the target and squeeze the triggers"".

What?

What the hell?

You should at the LEAST have some control over going forward and backward.  If it's there, I didn't friggin see it.

Look, it's worth the time to crawl of the ISS for 10 minutes if you literally have nothing else to do with your day.  Otherwise, hit up Mission ISS and explore to your hearts content.  It's paid for, but worth it.  

This was worth it for the lessons learned but not much else.  It's not a complete waste, but I can't recommend it with a clear conscience.","Feb 20, 2020 at 12:05 PM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 16:20:21.541818,Goffik,Absolute Garbage,"People rating this kind of ""experience"" as anything more than one star is why VR is in such a dire state today.

I literally have nothing positive to say. Graphically, this is way below par compared to other VR titles. The Earth is low-res pixellated rubbish, and there is no sense of awe whatsoever on embarking on your spacewalk. The controls are pretty dire, somehow failing to provide a decent grab-and-pull-to-move experience despite it being such a simple movement system. Then there's the section that leaves you spinning uncontrollably in space for a minute or two, which will make any other than those with the strongest stomaches physically ill.

And then there's the ""story"", if you can even call it that. Go through an airlock, be totally underwhelmed at what ""space"" looks like, spin in space for a minute or two, then die. Wow. That was really worth my time and taught me so much about the ISS, what the astronauts on it actually do, and how they feel about it. (Actually, it didn't. That was sarcasm, for those that didn't notice.)

I know it's free and for that reason I wasn't expecting too much. However, this fell way short of even the limited expectations I did have. Do yourself a favour, dear reader, and avoid this waste of space. (Pun intended.) There are other far, far better space-based ""experiences"" available that are also free of charge. Get those instead.","Sep 19, 2019 at 4:41 AM",1, 25,

I will say, as someone with pretty sturdy VR legs, there is a Gravity moment that was pretty dizzying for a second :)

I love the work they put into the assets, but not every game has to be about space disasters. I'd honeslty just play a game where you have to float around the ISS making mundane repairs.

The ISS here apprear to be in geo synchronous orbit not moving above the land mass it is over.  While the sun then moves in relation to the real ISS's speed (about 16 times around the earth in 24 hrs).  This ends up making it look like the sun revoles around the earth way too quickly.

I literally thought it was a real documentary by BBC TV with us onboard the real thing with real astronauts, it is not so. This was until I found it was a simulation - of a disaster in space as soon as you try to grab hold of the camera! Suddenly, you are in danger floating out into space as the camera ends up out in space out of your reach. The control try and get you back into the airlock after being thrown out into space. So as a simulation of spacewalking, they have to add in a disaster! I don't know what happens in real life up there in the real ISS, but would this really happen? Having said that, I think they added that into this simulation - as a 'game' to test your skills, so I do not know if anything else goes on if you succeed with your examination of the damaged panel. All in all, I have nothing to complain about despite it is a free download.

So... the criticism is valid. Right when I got into the game I saw how this could potentially make people extremely motion sick. The camera is shifting a lot and you feel like you have little control over the situation. The grabbing doesn't feel great. The developers gotta have strong VR legs man... I don't get motion sick easily but the part when you get thrown out from the station and start tumbling around... I had to actually close my eyes. Even if it did have better motion, like Echo Arena or Mission:ISS, I still would not give this more than 1-3 stars. The game feels clunky. Also, it would be nice to grip with the grip button instead of the trigger, like in most touch titles. 

The developers have clearly not developed for VR before and they should have done some research. It would take me less then an hour to find the most common causes for motion sickness in VR.

This looked promising, but it's so scripted and undeviating, and the controls so limited, that I uninstalled after doing it twice. Took maybe 10 minutes for both passes. Not really worth the download in my opinion. Problems include the following. Motion is entirely scripted - you can almost ignore the handholds and you still stay locked to the scripted path. You can’t grab but a couple items – everything else bounces away when you try. The “fly the spacesuit” bit seems (in my two tries) impossible and not physically likely – first I thought “I’ll save fuel by coasting”, but the timer keeps counting down when I’m not using fuel. And when I tried the second time to hurry and beat the timer, I got blocked from actually reaching my goal. You can’t turn your body at all – you can only turn your head within the locked-in-space helmet, so no way to look around or enjoy the experience. The “sunset” was soooooo faked it was silly. So yeah, pretty pictures, but I’d recommend either Lone Echo or Mission ISS for a much more realistic spacewalk and zero-g environment and experience.","Dec 3, 2017 at 10:23 AM",2, 7,

It's rather nice to look at but the controls are terrible in comparison to similar apps, like Mission : ISS which starts basically the same but offers a much more intuitive and efficient grip on objects. Here I got bored after a couple of minutes, seeing my hands bent in impossible ways, having difficulties grabbing handles, while me and my companion's spacesuits kept intersecting the ISS like there's no collisions. Well, you can try it anyway since it's free. :\","Dec 13, 2017 at 9:56 PM",3, 0,

If it weren't for Mission ISS I think it would have felt more impressive.

However, for what this is, it's mind blowingly good! It's not educational the way a lecture is, but they really put detailed attention into this game. The zero-G is downright amazing. Objects not only float, but have inertia. Furthermore, all the details are considered. For example, if you are touching the space station, you can hear the motors and equipment on the inside, but if you let go, well... SILENCE...

Truly a masterpiece, BBC has outdone themselves. But only if you know what to look for.

I'm used to using VR app for 3 years and I have had experienced here twice the worst severe motion sickness ever.  If devs or producers don't care about the motion sickness factor, it means they don't care about users. Therefore this app should be banned from the oculus store for this main reason. 
More over, the scenario is also a bad choice because it makes you feel like you are a failure. My first reaction : uninstall that crap at once.
