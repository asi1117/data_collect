I kind of want to buy ""Robo Recall"" now! That was really cool, and very comfortable! I accidentally punched my monitor while playing this, so... make sure you have room to move your hands a few feet.",Jan 16 at 8:17 AM,5, 11,

2022-05-28 19:04:55.413802,Bluray Charles,A fun step back to a simpler time,"This is just a demo that was used to sell VR as a platform way back when the Rift was brand new. It's very simple, but fun as a time-warp back to when things weren't quite figured out yet. Crack open this time capsule and pretend you're seeing VR for the very first time on the floor of a trade show. As a game there isn't a lot of merit, but as an over-the-shoulder glance back it's a worthwhile experience.",Nov 7 at 11:30 AM,5, 13,

2022-05-28 19:04:55.442724,TheGamer54321,Great demo!,Cool demo! I love especially love the physics. When I took my pistol and I tried to knock one of the roof handles it moved! The haptic feeback works perfectly as well. The attention to detail is perfect. Each shell has it's own collisions and simulations. I love the glass as well. If it gets shot the way it shatters and the fact that I can then move the individual shards with other objects is so satifsying. I have to get Robo Recall!,Mar 10 at 4:31 PM,5, 0,

If I can be brutally honest, the ending of the demo is super cool I love the matrix theme and when i found out it was a simulation I was HOOKED. I didn't discover any bugs so thats great!

I just believe people are giving this demo too much of a hard time. It’s a great game, and a good intro to VR. If you want to see what the Unreal engine and VR can do together, go to this game. It’s free, so that’s a plus. It’s more about being an intro, so if you like this, buy Robo Recall.","Feb 22, 2021 at 6:06 AM",5, 20,

Would I recommend it:    Yes
What do I rate it:              5/5
Pros:                                 It’s a fun FPS.

You are basically a Super soldier that can teleport and while you teleport time slows down.
IT IS just a tech demo and as mentioned in the title a precursor to Robo recall.
Unfortunally its very short and its limeted in the abilties you have. 
You can only teleport to certain small point in the train station.
That being said it is a great tech demo, guns, rifles and shotguns feels very nice and I really like that you can pump the shot gun.

2022-05-28 19:06:39.535314,JCTrick,Best 'game' to demonstrate VR to noobs,"This game, man... Is an excellent illusion for inexperienced users. (Almost prefer it's gameplay to Robo Recall) I'm one of the nerds that has lots of people in his life that can barely work a TV remote, let alone go save the universe in VR. 2 controllers, a headset and all those pretty squirrels to stare and poke at. They'd starve and die on some digital rock.

Enter a seriously fun jolt of franetic energy... a short blast of feel good violence and you can't be killed in the game. That is the real magic right there. While your aunt tries to figure out, for the fifteenth time, how to catch a rocket, she doesn't have to die over and over and get all f*****' cranky and start the horse crap up. I can't listen to everyone whine about how they can't play video games, yet they want to stay in VR and play games. I just... can't.

And everyone gloriously makes it through this fun experience with a smile on thier face. Even your best friend that still can't figure out how to use Siri... yes, even that person can complete Bullet Train.

I'm grateful to the devs. ;)","Apr 20, 2017 at 8:10 AM",5, 2,
