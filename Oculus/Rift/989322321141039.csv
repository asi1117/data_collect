2022-05-28 15:02:01.482229,masooony,Great game!,this game is amazing its so much fun swinging around from place to place. however the game is a bit short there are challenges that are fun to play wich kinda makes up for it. my one problem with this game is that they need to release it for the quest! its fun but its super annoying when the wire is in the way i mean yeah there's artificial turning but after a while it gets annoying so really i would give it 5 stars if it was released on the quest.,"Apr 22, 2021 at 5:00 AM",4, 1,

The feeling of wind and movement as you swing from hold to hold is awesome, and being immersed in such a strange beautiful world really makes the most of VR.  Even the sweaty palms I get from a fear of falling adds to it all.  Thank you for making this and adding VR support.","Sep 29, 2019 at 10:06 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:02:04.644770,Blobabee,Impressive,"I've had my Rift for a year and now I have the S. I had seen this game prior, but overlooked it till it went on sale. What a blast! It feels open world and so you can go about scaling the various plateus as you see fit. Sometimes it leaves you in a predicament, but that's part of the fun. I caught myself feeling like I was going to fall a few times! :)  I do think if you are one that's best with comfort VR, this is one to pass by, but if you love a good rush, I really recommend it.","Jul 6, 2019 at 12:32 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:02:04.659731,BlinxESP,"Please, I want my money back","I have been playing for a couple of days and I cannot feel more dissapointed. I cannot understand how this game has such a high score. I have mainly two complains that has made me impossible to like this game.
1. The controls has been simply port from a FPS into VR without considering the motion sickness. You are gonna get really sick playing it for first time. And that is not my problem. The real problem is the learning curve. The learning curve in this game is near to zero. You starts with a relative simple stage, to jump into the real stages. Which are really bad designed, the path you have to follow is just non there. You end up climbing more than swinging around like they show in the trailer. Till a point where I dont know if we are playing the same game.
2. Stage design is bad, it is not easy to see where to go. You will end up going nowhere and feeling you are in some sort of Demo or sand box with non-narrative driving essence. 

How can I return this game?","Aug 1, 2019 at 9:35 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 15:02:04.674690,sigma476,A good idea poorly executed,"The game offers so much and provides so little.  Let's start with the controls. When starting the game you are given the option to have a retracting grappling hook or a fixed length one.  These are drasticly different options and dramatically change the way you play.  You can only ever have one, and can not switch them.  It would be amazing (and fix much of the games problems) if you could switch between them mid flight.  Swing across a chasm then flip to retractable mode to hang tight to a nearby ledge, planning your next move. instead the gameplay amounts to trial and error as you figure out the way the devs moved around in their poorly planned levels.  

The levels are another major issue.  This may come primarily from a lack of beta testing, but the maps go between having no bushes (the only thing you can grapple) to having more foilage than could ever be useful.  The placements feel random, yes there is a general path from point A to B, but nothing laid out enough to plan more than two swings ahead. Consider the hub world.  A perfect place for players to hone their skills.  Make a set of paths and elements that players can practice on and use to move from gate to gate.  Anything but the current version, a minute long walk down a blank bridge, with hints of fun grappling but none actually present.  

Controls are very floaty and leaves the character feeling weightless. This might be desirable in a movement based game, but it means that even walking up a slight incline may be enough for your characters momentum to carry you off a cliff.  Combined with jumping sending you flying sideways seemingly at random, landing on an object takes more luck than skill. 

Despite the problems with the game, I found myself enjoying it in parts.  VR is still a developing medium and while this game failed in some ways it's core mechanic was still enough to hold my attention.  I have yet to try the sequel but probably will soon, after a look over gameplay to see what was fixed.","May 10, 2019 at 2:13 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 15:02:07.750464,CarloFromMilkyWay,this is the best VR experience so far.,"a premise: you must trust this game, master the commands and understand the physics of the strange world in which you are. You must also forget the realistic graphics of non-VR titles. A Promise: after doing these things, Windlands will give you the best possible experience. Will be scary when you look down after climbing islands suspended in the sky. Will be pleasing, when you find yourself dominating, from the highest peak, a world suspended in the void","Dec 25, 2018 at 12:09 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:02:07.765424,M-Hanzo,Really hard to get sick of,"I've owned my Oculus for nearly a year now, and this game has always been my go-to. The music and atmosphere are wonderful, and the platforming is super fun to explore. It only took 3 or 4 30-minute sessions of playing to completely overcome the motion sickness, too.
I do wish more thought/effort went into visually developing the world they created. The gameplay is fun enough, but the highlight (at least for me) is getting to explore this desolate, Atlantian-esque civilization without limitations. I feel the opportunity to tell the story about who these people were, and how they lived, was largely missed. The level design is somewhat random and unspecific, and while there ARE bits and pieces of info every so often (the floating ships were likely used for merchanting/transportation to different cities), I feel like a LOT more could've been done, especially on an exploration-focused game.

Even still, I've played this game countless times and have yet to get sick of it.","Nov 29, 2018 at 8:15 AM",5, 15,

If you like parkour games, and dont get motion sickness, then GET THIS GAME. assuming you are knowledgable in how gravity works (momentum) this game should suit you well, although i was a bit frustrated in a few areas because of the pure luck required to pass the obstacle.

Some things I'm missing : 1)  A slider to let me decide how big the sphere around me is 2) A casual practice map with perhaps a longer grappling range, in which you can't fall to your death and can just enjoy the fun of grappling around 360° with no need for walking or following a path.","Dec 17, 2017 at 8:34 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:02:14.133392,LuluViBritannia,"Excellent game, doesn't deserve the hate","Many people clash this game because it is more like an ""experience"" than an actual game. Although this game doesn't offer a storyline or multiplayer, it does offer wonderful graphics and sounds, an awesome gameplay (though simple), and overall an unforgettable experience. Of course it is not the best VR game out there, but it is not meant to.

Best use of the touch controller ever. Everybody loves that game. It's like beeing spyderman but with a cool universe.  Don't mind the polygonal graphics, all is in the gameplay and the orgasm of moving by jumping, grapling and flying. The movement is even better than echo one. My only problem with that game : it's the scariest one to me. It's much more painful for me to play than Resident Evil or any other horror game. I suffer from fear of heights, even though I used to work on rooftops of buildings. I constantly have sweaty hands and cannot play for mor than 30 minutes, after than I start shaking even crying. It's the only game that does that to me. It feel so real and standing up on a small block a so high is a nightmare. But it's fun at the same time but I cannot get used to it. Bonus this game is probably 40h of gameplay. Just try it, you will certenly fall in love with that game.","Aug 21, 2017 at 7:08 AM",5, 4,

I feel more motion sickness in Google Earth VR this game. That being said, it's largely due to the Touch Controllers. Focusing my eyes on a small portion of the screen to aim the hooks feels more comfortable than doing it with a gamepad. Even with a gamepad, there are options in the menu to make the motion more comfortable. On top of all that (because motion sickness is what turns people off to that game) the gameplay itself is great. Spiderman sim baby","Aug 3, 2017 at 9:33 AM",5, 0,

For those who feel comfortable and have gotten their ""VR legs"" definitely check this one out. This game really lives up to expectations.

2022-05-28 15:02:33.127589,jac,"Very comfortable, if you play right","Windlands is a great game. The movement is very smooth and not nausiating for me at all.

Here are a few hints though: I encourage you to NEVER use the right analogue stick, at all. Not for smooth turning, not on comfort turning. If you must use it, put it on comfort, but in general, stand up and actually turn around. This one change will make a huge difference.

Next, turning on comfort cage is a good idea, mostly to keep track of where your character is, keeping you from wandering too much as you turn.

Remember, VR nausia is cumilative, so you need to start it right. If you try to use smooth turning, then turn it off, YOU WILL NOT lose your nausia, it will continue to get worse, even if you have it comfortable settings. Play it on comfortable from the start, and if you feel fine after an hour, at your own risk experiment. This is why many newer games, like eagle flight, don't even allow you to turn off comfort settings, because someone will, not understanding the consequences, and blame the game.

I have been sick from playing games with poor vr controls, like technolust, but the game is smooth and predictable. As others say, you character slides a tiny amount when he stops, which is a very natural movement and not jarring like it would be if the stop was immediate.

Gameplaywise, its very exhilerating. Soaring through the sky, timing and getting the right swings or hitting the right ground is a rush. Its really great.

Also, not repetitive. This game is hard and ups the ante at every world. The fundamentals stay the same, but the challenges are varied and increase steeply. This is not an easy game, and  it doesn't teach you how to play. But its not hard to learn either.

Full disclosure, I have not tried it with touch yet. This all with the gamepad.","Jan 1, 2017 at 2:24 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:02:33.142549,Justos,Touch makes this a whole different game,"I originally bought this for gamepad (with hopes of playing it with touch) and it was really meh. I didn't like it. It doesnt hold your hand at all and I had no idea what to do.

Fast forward to now after touch launch and WOW. The feeling this game gives me is intense! I am fortunate enough to not be getting sick so ive been swinging around like spiderman. Really cool to experience. Every jump feels different and I have to mentally prepare myself every time.","Dec 26, 2016 at 5:02 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:02:33.158506,yellownumber5,How high-mobility VR should be done.,"This game has been sitting in my Oculus library for a while. Now that the Touch is out, I am glad I waited to play it.  This game is naturally suited for Touch, although you may have to fiddle with the options to get it right.  

Here is a warning: Windlands, since it's first controller-only release, has thrown the book at every single comfort mode experiment that exists.  They are all optional, and some will spoil the game.  With the Touch controllers, much of the need for comfort modes disappear, since you can easily physically turn around in your room-scale space.  Try to find a balance that works with you.  I personally have everything set to all the 'hard' modes, with only the ""comfort dots' on, which are a translucent plane of dots representing your real floor and don't move with the game.  'Normal' controller mode works great as pushing forward with the left hand stick pushes you where you are facing.  Keep side to side strafing on if you can to be more mobile  I've found no nausea problems at all after long plays. Turning with the right stick is the only thing to get me ill so far, but in room-scale, you don't have to ever turn with the right tumbstick, just turn your real body in the direction you want to go and push the left thumbstick forward to move.

Most of the game I barely even use the Thumbsticks to move.  This game is based around shooting grappling hooks at shrubbery to swing around towers of rock and trees like Spiderman.  The freedom and agility the game gives you to do this feels extremely natural swinging from one arm to the next.  This does not mean it is easy, but mistakes feel like your own fault for misjudging the distance of a swing, rather than the mechanics of the grapple cheating you.  Once I got a hold of the grapple mechanic, I found I was shooting at things out of my range of vision.  The game became  that intuitive, and climbing high towers are sense of accomplishment.","Dec 10, 2016 at 9:14 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:02:36.321048,MasterNamer,SUCH A RUSH,"After two minutes of physical disorientation, I fell in love with the simplicity of gameplay and the mental challenge it takes to achieve your goals. The height and distance in Windlands both feel real, so reaching the island 2K above you seems as if you've really overcome something in yourself.

2022-05-28 15:02:36.337005,michiganjs,Extreme sim-sickness hazard.,"I spent an hour trying every different comfort-mode option, starting with none and then introducing different ones to see if they helped at all. I've been in VR since the DK1 (3 years so far) and this game, dangit, sent me to rest on the couch with an ice-pack on my forehead. It's way, WAY more difficult to use the rope swing than I'd expected, and I constantly find myself stranded, hanging off of cliffs and contemplating virtual suicide as my only option to reach ground again. I won't play sitting. I won't play with a controller (that's why I waited to buy until after the Touch launch.) But I'm worried right now that I CAN'T play the way I want, because the stakes to my inner-ear and stomach are just too high. :( Also, what's up with sliding on grass after a jump? It's like the whole world has a layer of black ice on it causing you to overshoot even simple landings and perish by accident. Will update review if I become brave enough to find answers to these issues - because I *want* the sensation of mastery!!! It would be very hard-won, though. :(","Dec 22, 2016 at 3:37 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 15:02:36.351965,BewilderedMonkey,,"I feel like this game is substantially harder with touch controls, but that might not be a criticism of the game itself and more a criticism of my coordination. It does feel like the aim is slightly off the angle I expect it to be. That said this is a brilliantly novel game, with about 4 or 5 hours of immersive entertainment.

2022-05-28 15:02:36.367922,jmalmsten,This is a must!,"I remember the feeling when I tried Windlands on a friends Vive-setup. It almost made me fall over several times. That feeling of soaring through the air was almost too real. Now that Touch has arrived and I have spent considerably more hours in virtual spaces I finally can play this game once more. And wow. Just wow. Yes, I did put it into easy (hook onto anything) mode. But this just... wow... I AM Spiderman. Hooking into structures. Using the built up momentum to fly off and get in range of another structure. Hooking into that and just soar again. I truly cannot wait until someone does an Attack on Titan -type game where I can use hookshots and battle giant enemies with my swords...  If you have Rift and Touch. This is a must-have game.","Dec 19, 2016 at 12:43 AM",5, 2,
