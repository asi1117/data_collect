Very nice game. 5 stars.

If you liked the phone version, the VR version is just as addictive.  You keep wanting to go back to get 3 stars on each level while cursing the pigs while doing so.  I look forward to additional levels","Aug 5, 2019 at 5:13 PM",5, 21,"Happy to hear that you enjoyed the game!

My hand gets stuck mid air every single time I pull back on the slingshot. I physically have to shake my hand for the game to recognize my movements again. Please, for the love of god, fix the tracking issues. I’m on a Rift S and don’t have this issue with a single game. My hand isn’t outside the FOV — the game just didn’t dev proper tracking. I can’t get past a single level due to this issue.

Response to devs:
Thank you for looking into this and such a quick response. Perhaps, it’s a ‘me’ issue, but I don’t have this with any other game.","Jul 16, 2019 at 2:01 PM",4, 5,"Hello agagorn32!

 https://youtu.be/fqhhf0H8AjI

Just got it and played through it. I'm torn whether I should return it or not. It is such a short game with only a few levels, but there is replay value in trying to get 3 stars on each, and it is a fun playground I could see the kids getting some play time out of. Plus it's an easy game to show newcomers to VR.","Feb 8, 2019 at 5:51 AM",4, 45,"We just added spooky new levels, a new pig and more with today's update.

2022-05-28 13:43:18.345008,Muncheez_,Good Experience,"Good experience, since we all have pretty much played the game on our phones ,so it's interesting playing it again but in VR . Levels go really fast so u can easily beat the game under 30min, unfortunately . Also the first 2 maps are both by the ocean so it seems almost like the same map when playing. Overall I liked it tho , just for the experience alone.","Feb 8, 2019 at 6:52 AM",4, 31,"Did you see the update we released today? We added new levels, a new pig and more!"

2022-05-28 13:43:18.375925,ParadiseDecay,1st Impressions Video with Commentary!,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AiGBnCTDA (Please Note: Links might not work from Oculus so please search YouTube for 'Paradise Decay VR Angry Birds' for this video.

My Initial Thoughts:
I have to admit I was never a fan of the PSVR version of Tetris, I could never see the point of that in VR, but this game is a different kettle of fish. It feels more natural to be in VR and plays like a dream.

Built from the ground up for  VR this version of the game goes above and beyond the pancake version in more ways than one.
You can move around the play area in the VR version offering more scope for tactics and precision aiming.

To be honest I didn't know what to expect during my 1st impressions but this was pure fun and a blast.
If you have ever played the 'Slingshot' demo in Valve's 'The Lab' then you know what to expect and if you've ever played an Angry Birds game and thought it was OK, then you are in for a treat.

This was SUPERB and I never came across any microtransactions during my initial gameplay so I'm assuming this is the full game.
The developers have said extra content will be coming later.... so  Star Wars DLC Please!!!!!  :)","Feb 8, 2019 at 1:18 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 13:43:21.474232,Khalia09,Just awesome,It's just as much fun as zhe original i played for ages on my tablet PC. VR however puts Angry birds on a  new level. It's a bit short but I hope that just with the original more level will arrive in the future.,"Mar 25, 2019 at 12:37 AM",5, 4,More levels just arrived. We hope you enjoy them!
2022-05-28 13:43:21.489192,1foggy,Fun & solid game for any AB fan,"For the best challenge, turn off the aiming assistance from the beginning and learn to shoot naturally.   Then, try to get 3 stars on each level before allowing yourself to advance to the next.  It will prolong the game, as well as make it more rewarding to get 3 stars.  Most of the early levels are fairly easy but it really starts to get fun in the second zone of levels.   Got stuck on a few of them for some time, but it was fun trying to figure out how to squeeze enough points out of it to get all 3 stars.   It sounds like they plan on adding more levels later, so it's a worthwhile game if you like the AB series.","Feb 16, 2019 at 1:32 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 13:43:21.503660,Nameless4Now,Simply Delightful!,"Just about everyone knows Angry Birds, and this version is simply the best!  Oh the feeling launching those little birds through the air and watching them in Virtual Reality crash into their intended targets is just delightfully!  Very well made game, graphics and sound are top notch!  Played many versions of Angry Birds, but by far the VR version is the best!","Feb 8, 2019 at 9:33 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:43:21.518620,Red_Prez16,It's an Angry Birds Game...,"It's an Angry Birds game. You do the same thing that you did in Angry Birds, Angry Birds Seasons, Angry Birds Rio, Angry Birds Space, Angry Birds Star Wars, Angry Birds Star Wars 2. Only difference is that it's in Virtual Reality. So there really isn't anything special about this one. I paid fifteen dollars because of it being Angry Birds because I love Angry Birds (might be the biggest fan on the face of the planet), and I really don't see anything special about it.","Feb 9, 2019 at 1:10 PM",1, 12,

The ability to move around in the space (vice 2D) is fantastic and adds a whole new level.   My teen even comes out of his room to play with mom.    The levels do go pretty fast but I'm hoping new ones will be added over time.   Please keep it coming!

The game now contains 13 brand new levels, a new pig, a new block and more."
2022-05-28 13:43:27.847927,RuneSR2,Awesome game!,"It's a great game, highly polished, I get solid 90 fps using super sampling (ss) 2.0 - so you don't need a fast video card for this game, it should work flawlessly on a GTX 970 ss 1.0 (90 fps). There are no video settings in the game, so super sampling is your only option to greatly improve graphics. Graphics are nice, nothing spectacular, but perfectly fit the game. 

The game is great fun - you can teleport to certain locations, so it's really 3D. The game isn't very hard, at least the first 20 levels are easy - great fun for kids too. Teleport means no nausea. The music is great - and often fun - too. The best Angry Birds game ever!

A great thanks to the devs for adding support for left handed persons. Like me, my sons ages 6 and 11 are both left-handed, and we greatly appreciate being able to fully enjoy this great game.","Feb 15, 2019 at 6:20 AM",5, 2,

I will change my review when it's finally running.
Right now... I bought a broken game and I am not happy about it.

*UPDATE*
Awesome support, within the same day I got a response, they really tried to help me and worked together with me, having said that I do not like the game toooo much but that's propably my taste. It's working great now but it feels a bit too static not like something that had to be done in VR, just angry birds in 3D so... 3 stars for the game, 6 stars for the support if that was possible so 4 stars all round seems fair to me.

It is well constructed for VR, has pretty environments, and hillarious noises/bird and pig animations. Love it, needs more levels though. Perhaps a few for free since it was $15 dollars.. with not much replayability after you figure out the trick to winning each level. After that, I would easily pay for extra levels or buy some sort of season pass if you need more money to build more levels.","Feb 10, 2019 at 8:53 AM",5, 2,
