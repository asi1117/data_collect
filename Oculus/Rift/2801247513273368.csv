2022-05-28 20:40:10.080107,shoednuff,Made for competitive league only,This game really isnt fun unless you are in a league team and even then the league is run by incompetent people who try to bias the league towards their teams .,Mar 26 at 4:42 AM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 20:40:10.112022,Quinn Peter,"So good, I bought it twice.","Even though I had the game on oculus and was having the time of my life in the game, I still got it on rift and steam, just because I wanted to use the camera. If you are reading this, get this game. You won't regret it.",Jan 16 at 1:38 AM,5, 1,Thank you for your support ButterHD! <3 - TF
2022-05-28 20:40:10.127979,Outsider,This game is a MUST-HAVE!,"This has been my favourite FPS game for the past 9 months, and easily one of my top 3 favourite VR games of all time. If you want to play a fast-paced, arena-like shooter with a high skill ceiling, this game is for you. 

The gunplay feels fantastic, the locomotion system is as innovative as it is fun, and the community is full of great people. The different maps and game modes (payload-push, control point, domination, deathmatch) are a blast to play, and give a satisfying amount of variety to the game.

One more thing I'll add is this:
This game has had a sponsored esports league since it was in alpha. That's a pretty large indicator that the game is freaking good. (https://dashleague.games/)","Feb 26, 2021 at 5:11 AM",5, 37,Thank you for your review! And thanks for being part of the alpha as well! - TF
2022-05-28 20:40:10.149922,FloLeProwtogen,Great game !,"An amazing game with a good community. It's fun and very original. I play it since the alpha, and I was never disappointed. The OST is also great, and it immerses yourself into the game. I think it's a must! There is also the cross buy between the quest and the computer version.","Apr 5, 2021 at 6:00 AM",5, 6,Thank you for the review! Great to hear you enjoy the game and thanks for being part of the alpha! :) - TF
2022-05-28 20:40:13.288526,MONSTERMINDED,Whats wrong with the game now ?,"Update: I had to update software but it works now.

I have had this game a few months and was working fine! Then one day i went to play and it pops up a screen saying : Please reconnect your head set. All my other games are working just fine. I don't understand it ???
As far as the game it can be very fun but you move way to slow maybe that's the point but i think it takes some fun out of the game besides these two problems i give it 4 stars.","May 4, 2021 at 1:05 AM",4, 1,"Thank you, we are using the latest SDKs so indeed make sure you're updated. Thank you for updating your review! - TF"
2022-05-28 20:40:13.303485,KaydenH22,BRILLIANT,This game is amazing it uses tactics and brute force to create amazing gamemodes such as payload and deathmatch its also got a really nice community P.S I reccomend watching a tips and tricks video and i also reccomend charging shots with the pistol (2 charged shots are insta kill to the chest and 1 charged shot to the head is an insta kill),"Mar 14, 2021 at 2:24 AM",5, 8,Thank you Kayden! Happy to hear this! - TF
2022-05-28 20:40:13.318446,JordanXP,Must play multiplayer FPS game,"This is one of the best VR multiplayer games on the market if not the best, and with such great devs who constantly update it with new maps and game modes, it should be an auto buy for all VR users.","May 3, 2021 at 6:17 AM",5, 1,"Thank you so much Jordan, happy to hear this! - TF"
2022-05-28 20:40:13.333406,elemnt360,BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT,"What an awesome arcade shooter. I played on sidequest so I knew it was well worth the $20 for the official game. The movement, weapons, community, and game play is just so awesome. The replay value is a great one here. If you like shooters you'll love this.","Feb 26, 2021 at 9:12 PM",5, 11,"Thank you elemnt! Nice to hear you were part of the alpha. That also means you've seen most of the content, but no worries more maps and modes are on the way. - TF"
2022-05-28 20:40:13.348365,Matj2ix88,Simply...An AMAZING Game,"BEST VR FPS....YES, hands down.

Easily the BEST VR game, period. It's a great fast paced FPS that can be hours of fun. The community of players are welcoming and encouraging and very helpful (don't believe me, just stop them in game and ask questions!). Play against bots to practice or once you're comfortable, jump into public servers full of great challenging people. 

5v5 competition across ranges of maps from domination, control point, payload and deathmatch.

I've been playing since the Alpha and this is the only game I go back to in VR and play everyday I can. I love this game, the community of friends I've gained from it, and congratulations to the Triangle Factory for making this game what it is and the successes you have seen so far and inevitable future success from this release.
A definite must have! For $20, way underpriced....buy now!!!!","Mar 5, 2021 at 4:02 AM",5, 6,"Thank you! Wow thanks for the lengthy nice review. Really good to hear, and alright Dash League! - TF"
2022-05-28 20:40:16.469021,ncorns,This stopped me playing other games!,"This is a great example of what can be achieved in a standalone game for the Quest 2. It always runs smooth at 120hz and is great to pickup for 10 minutes or 2 hours. It's fast paced so be prepared to work on your VR legs. It takes a while to stand against other long term players but there are mixed level servers to choose from. Practicing with bot matches can help remove some of the fustration until skill develops. Community is really good and the devs listen to feedback and suggestions to make their game better. This game should be on everyones ""must have"" list. Content always being added so the return value over time is amazing.",Jul 2 at 2:16 AM,5, 0,Thank you so much ncorns! Happy to hear this :) - TF
2022-05-28 20:40:16.483979,alexdarwinross,"Excellent gameplay, amazing community","This game has been an obcession from the moment I loaded into a quickplay. Everyone is so friendly, gameplay reminds me of if valorant and overwatch had a baby, and the baby wore VR headsets.","Feb 28, 2021 at 12:55 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:40:16.498939,NoxLunaUmbra,okay,"bullet dmg inconsistent, few game modes, and deathmatch needs team based.

edit: people saying the community is full of great people, I have had at least one toxic person every match.","Mar 7, 2021 at 5:02 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 20:40:16.513899,RetroGamerFG,An Essential FPS For Any VR Owner,"Hyper Dash is the fast-paced experience missing from most current FPS-VR games. It's got that arcade-styled gameplay but has an esports feel that keeps you coming back for more.

I don't know if it's a Virtual Desktop thing, but using push-to-talk will sometimes crash the game at random moments. Not sure if anyone else has this issue.","Apr 14, 2021 at 10:12 AM",4, 0,"Thank you RetroGamer! We will look into the PTT crash you mention, that shouldn't happen. Thanks! - TF"

2022-05-28 20:40:19.657491,keithobri,"Buy this game now, thank me later","By far the most addictive, competitive, and fun games I have played.  Oh also, the community is absolutely the best.  Fast paced, excellent gunplay, smooth movement, and endless replay ability.  Since the purchase of my Quest 2 I have played this game nearly every day.  It is that great.  I just want to thank the Devs for all their hard work and tireless efforts to get this game right.  This deserves to be the best selling game in VR in my opinion.  Can't wait to see you in the servers!","Feb 26, 2021 at 4:00 AM",5, 13,Thank you! Appreciate the good review. - TF
2022-05-28 20:40:19.673448,Brendogg,Great Teamwork,"First great team deathmatch, capture the flag, and a ton more game modes in VR. Well polished, good communication functionality.
