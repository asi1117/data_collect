2022-05-28 16:16:53.840345,CWC333,Fun puzzle game,"This game is a very relaxing puzzle game using shadows as the main puzzle theme. I spent about a week going through this game, a few hours at a time. Seemed well worth the money to me. Some of the puzzles can get a little complicated. You can turn on a hint option which helps a little. I had to visit YT a couple times for help lol. There were a few moments I was amazed at the revelation of how to solve a puzzle. The story was pretty good as well. The texture detail is kind of low, but really doesn't affect the gameplay. My main complaint with this game is sometimes you get a little stuck outside the play area and it can be a little difficult to get re-oriented. And grabbing things sometimes didn't work so well. But I would definitely recommend this game.","Jan 3, 2021 at 10:28 AM",4, 4,"Hi  CWC333, thanks for the review!"
2022-05-28 16:16:53.855304,kaputis,One of the best,"What is there to say, it's just one of the best first person puzzle games, period, flat screen or VR, and the best game on the Quest (IMHO). Speaking of VR, this game would not be possible on a flat screen, whereas many other VR puzzle games would be/are. That fact makes this game even more worthwhile.
And, btw, there is a handful of levels that many players do not notice as they offer a parallel campaign and the main story does not hint at their existence. I believe the developers did themselves a huge disservice not making sure the availability of these levels is obvious to everybody, but maybe this is just me..",Apr 24 at 10:34 PM,5, 0,

Without spoiling anything, I will say I didn't think this game *needed* to be in VR until a very specific set of puzzles that sold it for me.

Further, while the levels are presented in two groups, it really does seem like there's an order you're supposed to take them in.

Either way, worth the price, especially if you can pick it up on a sale.","Dec 18, 2020 at 2:06 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 16:16:57.005878,Obneiric,"Very, very good puzzle game","10 different levels all with their own twists that keep the gameplay fresh. Story is confusing at first but comes together well in the second half. Game took roughly 6 hours to complete (including secret puzzles, nice touch) and I would say its among one of the better single-player VR experiences out there, its quality is comparable to puzzle games like The Witness and Talos Principle (disregarding length).

Only 4 stars instead of 5 because this is a direct port from Quest with no graphical enhancements. Textures are clearly low-res (although it doesn't hold the game back too much because of the pleasant cel-shaded art style) and there's no anti-aliasing. At the very least, adding anti-aliasing to this port shouldn't have been difficult.","May 3, 2020 at 12:14 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 16:16:57.020838,Weicho,Definitely Worth It!,"This is a little gem. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy! 

Pros: Patrick Stewart! Seriously though, the puzzles are engaging and challenging enough to keep you wanting more throughout the game but not so hard that you want to throw a controller. The graphics leave a little wanting but the environments are still quite beautiful. The story is definitely a star in this game. I love time plots and although there is very little dialogue, I found myself tearing up toward the end. They did a great job getting the player emotionally invested in the welfare of the lead NPC role! I played for about 5 hours over 2 sessions and took my time to enjoy the environment. I feel that I got my moneys worth. 

Cons: Honestly, I don't have a lot to say here. This was a great game! At first, I did feel a bit of motion sickness but it went away rather quickly as I learned to move more effectively. I did not use the teleport function. I only had one glitch; while trying to connect one hook to another in one of the later puzzles, one of the objects stuttered quite a bit and did not want to connect. This was only once in the entire time I played, so overall this is a very well polished game. 

Conclusion: I rated 5 stars because I feel it deserved it. Very well polished, pretty environments despite simple graphics, excellent plot, and puzzles at just the right amount of difficulty. Well worth the purchase! I look forward to seeing more from this developer.

System: Alienware R3-17 laptop, 6th gen i7, 32G ram, outboard graphics amplifier with Nvidia RTX 2080. Rift-S. Ran beautifully. Comfortably played sitting in an office style chair without any problems.","Mar 2, 2020 at 4:20 PM",5, 11,Thanks for the excellent review!
2022-05-28 16:16:57.035798,taquitobuddy,"Great narration, ok puzzle game","The narration in this, both by Patrick Stewart and also the actresses that voice the female character throughout her life, is quite excellent.  The story is also interesting if brief.  Unfortunately both the grpahics and level of VR interaction are a bit subpar.  As far as the puzzles, if you enjoy other VR puzzles games you'll probably like these, but if not there's nothing particularly special about them to win you over.

All in all, if you are already a puzzle game fan you'll probably enjoy this, otherwise not recommended.","Apr 20, 2020 at 11:28 AM",3, 1,

Very polished. 
Proper full length game. 
Lovely art style.
Nice story and narration.
Puzzzles at just the right level, probably easy to a high-medium.
Puzzles continually fresh and interesting, some interesting mechanics, not just ""find square object to make square shadow"".
A relaxed and pleasant time throughout.

Cons:
Due to its very nature, once you've solved all the puzzles, 2nd playthrough much easier. Not really a problem, 1st play through was long enough, will defo return once I've forgotten the answers.

One of the nicest, most polished games I've played in VR. Well worth it!","Oct 18, 2019 at 7:43 AM",5, 16,"Hi Fwak, thanks a lot for the review."

2022-05-28 16:17:00.227262,Aquareon,"A milestone for VR, very Pixar-like.","This game, for me, marks the true arrival of VR as a medium. The hardware was present as of 2016 but I knew we'd have to wait a while for the software to catch up, for developers to figure out how to best use it for story telling.

Shadow Point is the first VR game I have played where the interface disappeared from my awareness while playing. It wasn't about the medium, it was about the game. I was totally engrossed. All the usual little snags, niggles, jank and dubious design choices that take you out of VR games are not found here.

Everything is seamless, streamlined, and polished to such a high shine that absolutely nothing gets in the way of the experience. That, by itself, is a milestone for VR and a tremendous accomplishment, even if the game were mediocre.

It's not, though. Artistically the game is very simple but appealing. Reminiscent of early Pixar in style and tone, hence the title of this review. The story is interesting and well told by Sir Patrick Stewart(!) who made a wise choice lending his talents to this project. 

It was an original story as game stories go, invoking time travel of a sort to tug on my heartstrings as I helplessly watched the trapped Lorna growing older. Games which have interesting stories? Rare. Games which make you feel? Rare. Games which nail their implementation on an emerging platform? Rare. All three qualities in the same title? Triple rare.

Now add to that the gameplay mechanic. I worried at first it would be over-reliant on the shadow based gameplay. A one trick pony perhaps. But it just kept introducing new elements right up until the end, each of which was combined with the shadow puzzles to confound the player in a different way. I dare not be more specific for fear of spoilers, but it's very creative.

Shadow point is not good ""for a VR game"". It would be excellent as a pancake game, evolving the concepts found in Portal and the Talos Principle. It is a good game, period, which happens to be in VR.","Oct 24, 2019 at 9:49 AM",5, 2,

I was very impressed with this game. The puzzles are fun, showcase cool mechanics and require some out-of-the-box thinking. The story is also surprisingly emotionally engaging and moving, with excellent voice acting.

The graphics are fairly low-poly, as you’d expect from a title designed for Quest first, but the art design is lovely and the character animation is very expressive.

Hearing Patrick Stewart was awesome so gets an extra star :D Some puzzles can make you feel a bit queezy - probably best to play standing and turn 360 deg mode on in the settings if you have 3 sensors. Plays a little jerky through the tutorial and whilst loading other levels but otherwise smooth. A couple of innovations in some puzzles but otherwise quite easy","Aug 19, 2019 at 4:12 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:17:03.384816,VagabondVillain,A charming and polished puzzler,"I played this on an OG rift and enjoyed every second of it. After a breif tutorial, you set about investigating the disappearance of a young girl. This journey leads you through portals to a number of worlds, each with a unique theme and set of puzzles mostly involving the manipulation of light to create shadows. To be honest the puzzles really arent that difficult and I spent much of the game wishing for a bit more of a challenge, but only because the game does such a good job of incrementally introducing you to each new mechanic in a way that feels natural. Just everything about this game feels so polished. The story is intriguing and the voice acting is stellar, featuring none other than the great Patrick Stewart. There's a wide range of comfort and movement settings so whether you're seated with a pair of front facing cameras or roaming from room to room in your quest, this game will accomidate you. 

As far as the downsides go, most can be forgiven by the fact that this game was developed from the start with the quest in mind. The graphics are nothing to write home about and the whole experience is fairly linear without much in the way of exploration. The only items that can be picked up or interacted with are those that relate to the solving of the puzzles or progressing the story. But as I mentioned before, this game was made for a headset that runs off a snapdragon processor and has a battery life of about 2-3 hours.

All that being said, no matter what oculus headset you have, you should check this game out. You wont regret  it.","May 22, 2019 at 1:23 PM",5, 38,"Hey VagabondVillain, thank you so much for your in-depth review of Shadow Point.

2022-05-28 16:17:03.414736,whoa182,A relaxing puzzle game,"I was pleased to see that Shadow Point made it onto the Rift even though the game has clearly been designed to run on Quest.  

I found the game a joy to play, as I try to solve the puzzles at my own pace without them being too difficult and frustrating. 

I love that the game also has Sir Patrick Stewart narrating the story. If I'm being honest, initially, that's what made me take notice of this title because puzzle games aren't normally my thing.

The graphics are what you'd expect for a game made for Quest, but they are still quite pretty and colorful.  The music and sound quality in the game is also very good.

The only downside is that I wanted to pick up certain objects in the game but they were non-interactable. This is only a minor point, so I won't knock off any points for this. 

I recommend giving this one a try, even if you have a mild interest in puzzle games.","May 23, 2019 at 1:50 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 16:17:06.523422,WolfinVR,Absolutely Loved It,"Let's hit the basics.
- About 5 hours of content, maybe more, maybe less depending on your puzzle solving accumen.
- Quest level graphics even on the Rift, but still has beautiful enviornments.
- AMAZING VOICE ACTING
- Like seriously. Sir Patrick Stewart.
- Puzzles aren't overly difficult and while a few may prove stump-worthy, you'll be able to get all of them without any outside help. Awesome mechanics though.
- Really, really cool story. Took me a bit to figure it out, but once I did, I was hooked.

I don't see an obvious way to back up these saves, and there is only one save file, so if it gets corrupted for whatever reason, you lose all progress. Unfortunately it's just not something I want to go back through. I want to play the rest of the game, but like almost all puzzle games, there's no replay value. I'm extremely disappointed. I've been looking forward to this game for a while as one of the few puzzle games in VR, but it's a completely game breaking bug. I feel a bit robbed of my time and money.","Oct 3, 2019 at 11:06 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:17:06.584259,theregoes2,Constant Amazement,"If you can stomach the fact that this game was made for Quest and ported to PC then what you get is an absolutely gorgeous puzzler in a low poly art style with a good story and great voice acting. As other have stated, it's mostly messing around with shadows to make them fit into outlines on walls, but that is something I've rarely, if ever, done before. At least not in VR. And it feels right.  I've not had this much fun with a puzzler since portal, even if the puzzles aren't very difficult. 
As much as I enjoyed them though, it wasn't the puzzles that I liked most about this game. It's the impossible world. I was about to describe some of it, but I realized that I wouldn't want to be told about it ahead of time, so I'll just say it feels like being in a place like Wonderland. Pleasantly strange things happen.
I haven't completed the game but unless there are additional levels to be opened up later I'm very close and that's the one downside. It seems like it will be short. But, it has me using my Rift again and that's something that I haven't been doing much lately so I'm fine with it. 
I guess what I'm saying is this, if you're the sort of person who is angry all the time and hates fun so much that you actively resist having it unless a game is so good that you cannot physically stop yourself from enjoying it even if you spend the whole time frowning, then this game might not be your cup of tea. 
For anyone else, if you can afford it AND if you are alright with a great game that is quite short, then I say pick it up. And if it goes on sale, definitely pick it up.","May 25, 2019 at 10:26 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 16:17:09.712891,Hanover,Polished Puzzler,"This puzzle-game has you investigating the disappearance of a young girl.  The basic mechanic of the game is casting shadows onto portraits and match the outline of the shape.  It builds and twists that premise by adding other elements such as playing with gravity, mirrors, parallel realities and spacial orientation.

Patrick Stewart is you, narrating the story as you play.  You occasionally bump into Lorna who is also voice acted.  The story was excellent.

The enironments are well done. There are times when you'll fee like a genius for figuring something out.  I uttered ""Ah ha!"" several times.  Shadow Point has the Portal structure where it slowly introduces you to the rules and then requires you to figure out how to use them in the environment.  Some of the solutions felt very organic and you might be surprised how that thing you tried out of exasperation actually worked.  Simply throwing things over a wall or placing something on a ledge made me go, oh..duh..  A lot of the time it's not asking you to do anything spectacular, only to pay attention to your surroundings.

The game took me about 12 hours to complete.  The reason I knocked it down one star is that there are times when you can accidentally solve a puzzle without understanding what you did.   The game also dragged around the end to the point where I had to take a break just to relieve myself from something that became slightly tedious.

I only encountered one bug and thats when I attempted to cross a bridge that wasn't set completely right and the screen blacked out and told me to go back into my play space.  I had to go out of the level and back in.  In fact, you'll often be told to get back into your playspace if you accidentally back into objects when you're not completely centered in your playspace.  But it wasn't too bad.

Overall, this is a very fun game that I can highly recommend.  The puzzles were fair and the story was pretty good.  I even felt a slight lump in my throat during one scene.","May 28, 2019 at 7:35 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:17:09.728849,RuneSR2,Worst graphics ever? PhoneVR - not PCVR!,"No real textures and a polygon count so low you can basically count the polys with the naked eye. So this clearly is a Quest game ported to Rift, and man it shows - must be the lowest poly count I've seen in I don't know how long. Felt like a PC game on my Voodoo Graphics in 1996. 

Sorry, I can't - and won't - play such games, no matter how good the story may be. I love games like Lone Echo and even PSVR games, but this GearVR-like level of polys is completely unacceptable. No way I'm going to support devs who have done absolutely nothing to make this game ready for true PCVR.

2022-05-28 16:17:12.838531,cyberzane,Great game with a fantastic story.,"This is my first time really writing a review for a game, but this one is so good that I felt the need to. It walks the line between challenging and frustrating so well, and the story is immersive and real-feeling enough that even when I did feel like quitting out of frustration, the need to see what would happen next kept me going through it. The visuals are also stunning, especially for such a low-poly art style, but perhaps the thing I liked most about it was the music. It doesn't always show up, but whenever it does it's always a pleasant surprise that tugs on the heartstrings with just a few notes. I've been looping the main theme for days ever since I finished the game lol.
     The only potential downsides for me, personally, was the motion sickness and a few limitations on the ""sitting"" mode of playing. While the game does have a teleport only option to move around, the nature of solving the puzzles makes it incredibly frustrating, if not impossible, so get around solely by teleport, so using the free roaming option is somewhat inevitable. That said, I managed to get around this by simply closing my eyes when free roaming was necessary, but it's still something to be aware of.
    The second downside is that when you're sitting, a few of the puzzles are impossible to solve. There is one particular puzzle (that I believe was shown in the trailer) in which you reach into a wishing well to grab a key, but the sitting mode doesn't allow you to reach down far enough to grab it. This can be solved by changing the mode to standing for a few seconds and then you can go back to sitting, but it's something that took me a long time to figure out.
    Even with those downsides, though, it's still absolutely worth five stars and its story is a thought provoking one that is sure to squeeze at your heart. The puzzles are also super fun and feel very rewarding to solve, especially if it takes you a long time to crack it.","May 28, 2019 at 1:57 AM",5, 1,

Charming environments, excellent voice acting (seriously, they got Sir Patrick Stewart for this?!), interesting story, and great puzzles. Everything I wanted from a story-driven puzzler game!

I do have some nitpicks though. Some of the shadow puzzles were too finicky with matching the shadows. Most notably the Key + Dragon skull fragment combo in ""The Huntress."" That took waaay longer than it should've to solve. I also wish there was a way to actually read the aforementioned Journal. At some points, I missed what the narrator was saying, so I was fuzzy on the story until later.

Nitpicks aside, it's a great VR puzzler that's worth the full price! Highly recommend for those looking for a good story-puzzler to play in VR.","May 29, 2019 at 3:33 PM",5, 2,"Hey TalonAeolus, thank you for the review! We're happy to hear that you had fun playing Shadow Point."
