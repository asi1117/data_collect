I know for a fact that I put in my secret pin number to make the purchase. My best educated guess is veer vr isn't compatible with windows 11. I hired a pc repairman to look at the problem and try to resolve it, and I think that might have cost me an extra $100 dollars.",Feb 2 at 4:57 AM,1, 2,

The issue starts right after the app opens. At first everything and  is oriented correctly, but as soon as I move my controller, the orientation of the view shifts to my right a good 2 feet. I can see my controller at least two feet to the rightr of where it actually is. This makes it so I'm looking at the menu from an angle. On top of that the view pans when you move your head to create the immersion effect. When your view is shifted and not where it should be this is incredibly nausea inducing. 

I have started and restarted thius several times. I even uninstalled and reinstalled and this still happens. Devs can you please respond to this and tell me if there's a fix for this?",Sep 17 at 11:24 PM,1, 0,

i can't fix it with oculus setting.

Thank you for your reply. 
But still I can't hear sounds.
It's not your fault, it's a Oculus' fault, cause the sound is vanished in other apps such as Disney movies, Smithonian Journeys, DeoVR Video player, and even in Oculus Video!!
I'm a Rift user.
I guess Oculus expel old machine users for making them buy new models, but I hesitate to do so. Even if I get the newest model, the machine might be out of work in two years.","Feb 24, 2020 at 1:41 PM",2, 0,"Hi there,

Thank you for your review. The high quality 360 video could be giant, and it might be extra demanding to your graphics card.

2022-05-28 17:17:34.378721,trevmeister,,"Excited to try it out, but having a strange issue.  This app won't track my Touch controllers.  I can see a white dot centered at 12 o-clock (underneath the row of videos ) that doesn't move with my vision, but seems like maybe it's meant to.  Radiating left and right from the white dot are two white segments (one per lens, the left segment in my right lens and vice versa) which rotate around the dot as I tilt my head.  What it boils down to is me not having any ability to navigate the app beyond scrolling through videos with thumbstick.  I've tried restarting Oculus and reinstalling app to no avail.  Looking forward to updating review when this issue is fixed.

I absolutely love it as it is exactly what you'd expect.
BUT: as more people have stated in their reviews, all videos keep buffering at a constant rate, pausing your experience for more than just a couple of seconds.

No, devs, I'm not going to download every video I want to see, because I don't have unlimited HD-space and I registered for your stream, not your downloads.

All in all, this is a great platform, but it definitely needs some updates/patches to fix the very annoying loading interruptions.","Dec 22, 2018 at 6:35 AM",3, 4,"Hey Kaastosti!

2022-05-28 17:17:43.852382,Orladan,Aaannddd...buffering.... (Update),"Title says it all.

**Update** - The developers have updated the software and there is no longer a buffering problem.

Now that it no longer buffers, I can comment on the program.

Most of the videos I have watched are rather amatuerish and the quality swings wildly video from video.  Not only in content, but also in video quality.  Some are better then others but most of them tend to be rather blurry.  I think the best looking one I saw was Expedtion Antartica.

I don't know about the quality of the videos that you have to pay for as I didn't bother to pay for any.

Also, could we please get rid of the pointer while we are watching a video.  Every video I watched had a white dot that followed my pointer.

I am glad that the developers optimized the program so that it no longer buffers.  I would just like to see more interesting and better qulity content.  Maybe I would have seen better stuff if I had paid for the premium stuff but I don't like paying for something if it's going to be the same quality I see in the free content.  Perhaps the developers could release a sample video of what you get when you pay?

As it is, I can only give the program a middle of the road 3 stars.","Dec 26, 2018 at 4:06 AM",3, 0,Hello Orladan! We understand that buffering can be very frustrating.

A few reasons I like VeeR:
1. Sometimes my equipment getting slower/very hot when watching videos on Youtube; But it is better on VeeR. I guess they may have done some optimizations on the video player.
2. I think producers on VeeR are bit more professional. (I watch on Youtube and facebook as well). I came across a couple of very attractive/high quality videos recommended by VeeR and I like them so much; then I go back to Youtube and found out these videos got very very few views...bad for the hard work of the producer.
3. I recently travelled to China and man...I cannot use Youtube at all cuz of the ""great firewall"" by government but I can use VeeR no problem at all LOL
