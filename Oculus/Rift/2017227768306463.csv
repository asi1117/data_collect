Also the ""branching"" is minimal at best. and it is really SLOW.  Sorry.","Aug 23, 2019 at 10:50 AM",2, 5,"Hi, thank you for trying our experience. I'd like to point out that branching is not limited to the moments when the controller lights up, which only happens when it makes sense in the story. It also happens passively in each scene and depends on who and when you keep you focus on. So each experience will be different, with 3 completely different endings. Hope this helps!"
