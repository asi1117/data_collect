2022-05-28 17:41:01.335134,DelapierceD,Little Detail,Very little detail on how the development occurs. Does feel like Anti-Choice propaganda,"Jan 9, 2021 at 10:43 AM",1, 15,
2022-05-28 17:41:01.349097,cybernettr,A tribute to the wonder of life,"I wish it showed the development of the baby from the zygote all the way up to the fetus, but this is meant to be more of an introduction to the wonder of life than a super scientific or instructional experience. As such, it does it’s job well.","Sep 26, 2020 at 11:42 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 17:41:01.392980,Zathereth,Boring,"Boring and indescriptive. Tells you things like, the Retina forms at so and so amount of weeks, but does not describe the choroid layer or when the scelera is formed. The white light and other transitions that were done poorly and clearly not tested by the creators, made me want to throw up or blinded me.","Jan 6, 2019 at 9:50 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 17:41:04.541558,CrazyDindon,Thank you !,"This is a gift, as futur parents we really liked this experience. For me it helped even more to be connected to the baby. Very informative and really well done technically, the immersion and special effects are poetics, and the UI well thinked. Great job all the team !","Nov 17, 2018 at 7:54 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 17:41:04.556518,ericjacobus,This shows that the unborn are human.,"It's incredible seeing such a beautiful work of 3D technology celebrating the miracle of life. If you've ever had doubts that your unborn child is human, or wondered when human life ""begins"", watch this and realize that your baby is a developing human from conception. Thank you Oculus for this beautiful reality check.","Oct 5, 2018 at 2:00 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 17:41:04.571478,barryh13,Excellent example of the power of VR,"I will become a Dad in Feb 2019. This peek inside the womb, of how my baby develops his senses and experiences the world, just blew my mind. Thank you to the developers and producers for giving me this experience!!","Oct 30, 2018 at 5:30 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 17:41:04.585440,Mahavo,Very educational,Apps like this always amaze me! I love the immersion they add to learning and how involved you get when learning through VR. My daughter loves watching these too and loves what she learns from them. Another great app!,"Sep 26, 2018 at 6:02 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:41:04.600401,poccy2010,Scary and creepy,When i first opened the app i thought this was amazing with the stunning graphics and sights but the narrators voice was whispering. It was quite creepy and uninviting yet interesting. I didn't like it as much as i thought but i guess it was still enjoyable!,"Aug 10, 2018 at 12:59 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:41:07.724046,sirpresage,Interesting and nicely done,Multiples languages would be a plus,"Aug 18, 2018 at 11:22 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:41:07.739006,XtremeHardcoreGamer,High Quality!,"Compared to many other VR content, this is high quality material. It's free-- I highly recommend it. Its basically an experience that educates the viewer about a developing fetus wrapped in a high production value package. So if you think you might find that interesting check it out.","Apr 14, 2018 at 4:55 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 17:41:07.753966,ronmoes80,Audio problems,"Firstoff, I must say the visual side of this app is stunning and I can't say anything about that. that said,
The audio has some problems and suffers from issue's that are propably caused by the developers themselfs.
To start, this app suffers from loudnesswars. the music is so LOUD that setting it to 30% it still is LOUDDDD! 
oke, then the naration they filtered out so much low to midlow frequentcy's that it sound much too thin, everything below 1K is gone . and to top it off they used extensive use of reverberation in a belly filled with fluid????? really? is that how a baby hears things?  
A crash course in audio mixing for the mixer that did this app is not a redundancy.","Apr 30, 2018 at 12:08 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 17:41:07.767929,neuro27,"Cool, but a little creepy","There are 5 videos to watch about embyrology. They are narrated by a whispering British lady. They are all pretty cool and informative, but a little slow and kind of creepy for an educational app. The best part is definitely the visuals - very immersive! It's free, so if you're at all interested in the subject, then definitely check it out.","Jan 15, 2018 at 1:21 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 17:41:07.782888,2nice4life,,the narrative with the stupid whisper messes up the whole experience.,"Mar 21, 2018 at 4:38 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 17:41:10.887585,Joshuahuk,"Its free, give it a go!","An interesting insight into how a human baby develops. Not particularly interactive but I didn't feel it needed to be.

This would be great to see in the schools of the future, not just for children but perhaps even specific tasks for surgeons and other medical professionals. An experience like this provides a much greater depth than a traditional video.","Nov 11, 2017 at 12:04 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 17:41:10.902545,FastLawyer,Best VR educational movie short,"This is the best educational VR movie short out there, bar none.  Very high production value.  Amazing visuals and sounds (excellent music too).  Samantha Morton does a great job narrating this title.  It's easy to get emotional watching this title, it's a shared experience which we only get to experience this closely because of the magic of VR.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the point and click nature of several options that I think would have been better if they had been cut out.  Just make it a completely cinematic, guided experience from A to Z versus clicking on the 5 different senses and then clicking on several more options after that.  It brought little immerson to the table and would have been better if this title was just a completely guided experience.  Maybe after viewing everything, they could have put in the point and click stuff.","Nov 10, 2017 at 10:06 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 17:41:10.916507,michiganjs,"Beautifully made, VR-native documentary!","This was the first VR experience I felt compelled to actually email the developers and thank them for making. Every aspect of the production was beautifully-made and effecting. It's true, interactive, realtime-VR (best experienced seated), and I can't wait to share it with others. Wonderful!!!","Nov 13, 2017 at 3:03 AM",5, 7,

Only those with a weird perception of themselves or of the world won't love it, otherwise every healthy person in mind, will find this an amazing experience.","Nov 29, 2017 at 7:07 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:41:14.032174,WhyKlef,To think I almost skipped it!,"What a great experience that was. This is a PERFECT example of just how VR can carry an experience beyond anything else we've experienced prior. 

Such a unique perspective and great way to learn about the baby we were, the ones we had and those we'll be welcoming into the world. Great app that everyone should experience at least once.","Dec 5, 2017 at 12:05 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 17:41:14.061097,Gallican,,an incredible VR journey and philosophical /ethical question? at such an early stage we have this individual forming... but that is half it and its possibility. at the receiving  end of this new life are they equiped to help it in its struggle. is it formed from love? is there someone to nurture it and to help it round out and ground its soul. i am not equipped to make that judgement. I hope though if in the alternative that that budding soul is reborn it could be received by blessed hands and hearts.,"Nov 11, 2017 at 10:40 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 17:41:17.216657,FreakFire74,A moving experience,"A delightful experience. You are right there in the womb with the fetus, experiencing the basic developing senses, accompanied by the wonderful narration of Samantha Morton. The vivid imagery and music was very moving. It gave me a sense of wonder about how incredible it is that we are here in the first place. Highly recommended!","Nov 11, 2017 at 7:55 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:41:17.232614,Sciom1001,"Good visuals, poor narration","Great to look at, but the narration is just annoyingly bad, like someone trying to imitate david attenborough but with a boring voice while talking very softly in a weird ASMR like tone.","Dec 9, 2017 at 11:52 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 17:41:17.246577,katanalevy,Incredible short form experience,"I thought I had lost the 'wow factor' from VR but this short experience revitalised that feeling for me.
