2022-05-28 17:51:32.468080,Embex5,So addicting,"I e spent hours on hours exploring with no hud. Blown away by the graphics and combat. The crafting and companionship with your animal followers. The story and cutscenes that your are a part of. The side quest,challenges,arena just sooooo much content and so much to do. I mean you got coin toss and ace throwing or go frolic in the fields of a tiny narnia. It’s got swords, guns,axes daggers shields and they all serve a purpose just like companions . All with a very ominous story that you learn slowly that keeps you in. So many worlds and a huge map with so many books and crannies maaaan it’s been 3 weeks and im still at only %6 completion. Worth every penny especially when in real life it’s snowing or raining all the time",19 days ago,5, 22,

Picked it up again months later and started to fall into the wonderfull and beautifull world of Asgard's Wrath. The scene's are beautifull, puzzels are great fighting is cool.

I only regret that the developpers hasn't managed to minimize the transition times. You pratically have to wait 'ages' before getting to another location when using the map.

This is the best VR game i have ever played, hands down. Better than HL Alyx. Its visually stunning, controls are super responsive and the games visuals are breathtaking. Ive heard its a 50hr game to complete 100%, which is insane. If you have your VR legs, this game is a must. Think Skyrim, with a norse setting. Dungeons, main questline, side quests, puzzles. I cant recommend this game enough!!!",Dec 18 at 6:29 PM,5, 89,
2022-05-28 17:51:35.708413,UbyGen,Very bad fighting system,"Altough the game is very nice, but quite unenjoyable bocouse of the bad fighting system. There are enemys what cam damage only if u brake their ""shield"", and for that u have to parry a singiture attack, wich is every 4-6 attack, and u have to do it 3 or more times, and then can u damage the enemy. Its very fustrating.",Feb 22 at 3:27 AM,3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:51:38.807125,Guyute1975,Best game available in the Oculus store!,"I was first drawn to this game because I have studied Norse mythology in depth in the past. Let me say this game is definitely on point when it comes to Norse lore. 
The graphics are beautiful runs smoothly, the map system and the inventory system are the best on any game I've seen in a long time. 
Just started the game and only have about an hour into it but I can tell this is going to be an amazing journey. 
The only downfall I see so far is the long load times.

Worst thinh change too often the protagonist which are very diverse and it is not a good thing.

2022-05-28 17:51:38.851007,Roasted,Most content rich VR Game,"On paper the game is 5/5.  Graphics are top notch, it has 50+ hours of gameplay, multiple characters to control, tons of gear to collect and upgrade, cool boss fights, mini-games, animal companions to upgrade, and  incredible sense of scale with sections where you're either tiny or a towering god. In fact, this game makes most other VR games look like $5 mobile games when it comes to scale and content.

Unfortunately, I found myself struggling with the combat system.  It never completely clicked for me.  To make matters worse, I didn't have the time to play the game continuously.  I'd take a week or two break, and come back only to be completely lost.  I eventually swallowed my pride, and about halfway through the story dropped the difficulty to easy and finished the rest of the game.

Despite this, I would still highly recommend this game to everyone.  There is simply nothing like this currently in VR and there is some true WOW moments.  The developers weren't afraid to experiment and from time to time they knock it out of the park.  The Tyr boss fight, for example, is hands down one of the coolest things I've experienced in VR.",Nov 28 at 12:03 PM,4, 74,

Even more nso now that Facebook (Meta) said they are no longer are creating games on the pc platform.. I would love to see more from this saga or these devs, but not limited by a mobile CPU/GPU.

However, it is one of the rare games that come with intense motion sickness (similarly to Borderland 2 VR). It is unfortunate, but I simply cannot continue to play this game for this reason.

2022-05-28 17:51:48.333645,cluthz,Could have been great.,"A very competent RPG with some really annoying parts. The game looks great, 90% of the gameplay is good, with a lot of puzzles and dungeons that you can go back and explore further when you unlock new companions that will open secrets and different paths. However, the game is littered with annoying, and in my opinion, way to hard even on the easiest difficulty minigames. These are things like extremely drawn out and turret like sections where you have to aim and shoot cannons on invading forces with a terrible control systen where you use two levers to control the cannon and one lever to shoot. At least for me it took 4-5 tries on the easiest difficulty, which takes a few minutes pr attempt. It would have been fine if this was a one time thing, but its not. Also some of the boss encounters just feel cheap, shooting projectiles towards you while you try to shoot them down, rinse and repeat so many times... I found pretty much all these minigame bosses/encounters just a huge waste of time in a game that has some really nice exploring and environments. If i have an hour to play one evening I don't wanna spend 25 minutes of those being very frustrated at some game machanics just to progress the story I want to play.",Nov 6 at 9:45 PM,3, 6,

2022-05-28 17:52:00.890061,Stbbrn,Good RPG,"Probably the most advanced VR RPG there is. 4.5/5, rounded up to a 5. I spent more time in this game than any other in VR. 

Pros:
The storyline is good, yet it doesn’t take itself so seriously sometimes which adds some fun. The main quest is very entertaining. 
The battle system is quite interesting.
The gameplay is well designed. 
Switching to god mode to solve puzzles was a really nice touch. 
Having animals companions to help you fight and solve puzzles is quite nice

Cons:
I wish there was more exploration in this game, it tends to be a bit too linear for a RPG. 
The side quest are all pretty much the same, so it ends up feeling like grinding for items and money
There are a bit too many battles sometimes, the bows and crossbows are pretty useless because they can’t break armors.
I wish there was less companions with more skills and evolutions.
The last boss difficulty is way too high, yet quite underwhelming. 

Overall an amazing game that I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy RPGs",Oct 17 at 5:30 AM,5, 3,

I never ended up finishing the game, it just gets so monotonous. Zero replay value. 
 
OLD REVIEW:
Consistently, about once an hour roughly, this game freezes and a dialog comes up which says that the game is 'HUNG' with other details. Overall it's not game-breaking as saves are often, but I just got out of the arena after killing 20 enemies + a boss (almost killed the boss) when the game froze and shutdown. Needless to say I'm pretty irritated. Fix and I'll rate 5 stars. Just because you can push updates doesn't mean the game should be ready when I pay for it.

To other reading this, it's totally worth buying for $40. Seriously the mechanics are awesome and the world is ginormous(for VR). Most of all the graphichs can't be matched and I love the combat mechanism.

I think bows could really use some work. Devs, for an example of how a bow works, download In Death, they got it down perfectly. 

You guys did a great job with the throwing mechanism, though it still feels a tad sketchy for small targets. 

I'm really enjoying the game but again I can't call it 5 stars until it works (even though in my heart I know it is) <3",Sep 16 at 12:30 PM,2, 1,

It has complete worlds of environments, that are rich in amazingly detailed and incredible looking assets. Your sidekick NPCs are funny, and the AI for them actually seems to work. There are countless weapons, potions, pickups etc. And I think this is one of the mistakes of the game - there are too many ! The story is pretty linear, but it's still impressive, with Gods bounding over mountains, and riasing mighty tempests. 
Something makes me feel that this game is a little too good, maybe thats why it doesnt seem to appear in the 10 best VR games, seriously I have no idea why. I dont really like or play these types of games normally, but after a year I am still playing it. The worst thing about this game is it shows how bad other VR titles really are, especially where an existing game has had a VR camera added, and nothing else.

The interface is really good made for VR, combat is much fun after you found out how it works and that you own reaction is not the bad game.

If you like Gothic, Skyrim or God of war, this could be a game just for you.

When I initially loaded this game up and started to play it after choosing to buy it over a few other titles, I began to regret my decision ... but then I kept playing. This game is a lot of fun.

The combat system took some getting used to. I had to learn how to parry blows and how to look for the blue lightening telling me which blows were especially important to parry. I had to get used to some of the other mechanics as well, but now that I have this is one of the funnest games I have played in VR.

The puzzles are clever, the combat is fun, being a giant or super tiny is AWESOME, characters are engaging - overall this is a well-made, creative game - especially for someone new to VR like me. Highly recommend picking this one up if you like a great RPG.","Apr 13, 2021 at 3:28 AM",5, 68,

However I set it aside and played another VR game, Half Life Alyx, then returned to this game. When I opened it up, everything works fine and peachy until the initial loading screen. It kept loading forever so I assumed it was a corrupted save, and deleted it. Then I tried starting a new game, and everything works fine until the movement options screen, where it just straight up crashes (no crash dialog though). I have a laptop that supports high end games like Cyberpunk 2077. (1660 ti max q design, 10th gen 17, 16 gb ram, nvme for reference) However for some reason, I haven't been able to get it working. I'm suspecting it might've been the new update? I'm hoping the team at Oculus can help me out. I already uninstalled and reinstalled the game just in case there was some corruption, but still no dice.

You find your way blocked by the architecture of this stunning and alien world.  Lifting your eyes and hands to the heavens, you see a glowing orb pulsing above.  You reach out and feel your spirit leave your body, soaring to impossible heights.  When you open your eyes, you tower above the ant-like priest whose body you left behind.  Grasping at the golden sphere, a bow of lightning materializes in your hand and you draw a shimmering arrow to take aim.  The horses' legs start swinging like pendulums as you fire golden bolts at glowing bells.  As the melody rings throughout the cavernous expanse, the rooms shifts and opens the way forward.  Releasing the bow, you channel your spirit back into the body and find yourself standing once more, a mortal, in a cathedral built by the gods.

2022-05-28 17:52:32.468600,Leapmaster,Painfully Mediocre,"This game confuses me. I really wanted to like this game. A fully featured single-player adventure game that fully embraces VR features and has the budget to back up its ambitions? Sign me up! Except... it just feels half-baked at every corner.

Wow, melee combat that tries to circumvent VR's lack of any real ""weight"" by implementing a block and parry system to force good positioning? That sounds incredible! Except that you *have* to use the parry system to kill certain enemies on most difficulties, and some attacks have the most bizarre and confusing telegraphs, and the parry system itself sometimes seems to just... not work even when you do make the right motion. All it took was one enemy encounter 1-2 hours in that refused to let me parry it to sap all fun out of this combat system. You can turn the difficulty down to easy (which is weirdly annoying in and of itself as the menu is just a rotating wheel of vague difficulty names with no description, so I had to look them up outside of the game), but then this robs the combat system of all depth, and makes everything die embarassingly fast, even with no upgrades. I could not find a middle ground between painfully easy and painfully boring, all because they built up everything around a parry system that just doesn't work consistently.

The visuals are often great (for a VR title), and there's an incredible amount of variety and detail. It's a shame they pop in and out of low-detail models so frequently, and the game is prone to intermittent stuttering and crashing.

The puzzle-solving is neat, but extra frustrating when you're stuck awkwardly standing in your living room for half an hour.

And the writing and voice acting are just... weirdly bad? No context is given to almost anything and so many lines sound stilted.

I really wish I could see this as the killer app it's hyped up to be. Instead it just feels like a half-baked, unpolished, confused game with a decent budget that really outstays its welcome.","Apr 5, 2021 at 2:50 AM",2, 5,

I was really enjoying it until I got to a certain point where they introduce the idea of 'Runic Armour' - you are completely unable to hurt enemies with this until you perform exactly the right parries & counters it wants you to. I just couldn't get the right cues from the game's chaotic visuals while playing in VR, which is already overwhelming. The use of colour coding probably didn't help, as I'm clour-blind, although I don't want to over-emphaise this. I probably could have adapted & learned the exact sequence I had to do things to allow me to go to the next part of killing the enemy but it just made it frustrating & not fun. Even so, I wouldn't want to tell people not to try the game, especially as many of us got it free. It's a game with very many good points, it's just that in the end the combat ruined my enjoyment.

For me the game just ran out of steam about 10-12 hours in. After that everything just felt the same. 

The puzzles are insanely easy
The story is just kinda meh, and is a collection of short stories. The final twist is so obvious you have to be a complete idiot if you dont see it coming a mile away. 

Theres A TON of sidequests but many of them are just the same. Upgrade your weapon, upgrade your follower, light 5 torches etc. And again the puzzles in the side areas are just soo easy.

The combat is a big offender, af first it seems amazing, but anyone who has played Until you fall with find this combat REALLY boring. Mostly because you can just flail your arms around, since they dont take the arc of your swing into account. Then to remove the shield of the enemy you have to wait for the blue attack so you can deflect it. I HATED just standing there like and idiot waiting for the AI to do this attack even when i provoke it to happen. The non-shielded enemies pose no threat to you either. When deflecting its also REALLY imprecise and sometimes it works and sometimes not. I turned the difficulty down to easy, and instantly it became more fun since i could just focus on the adventure aspect and forget about the boring combat

The boss fights are the same, just with some different attacks and the blue attacks take even longer to happen.

Theres FAR TOO many varients of crafting materials, it just becomes a chore to gather everything you need, 2 variants would have gotten the job done. 

BUT i think you should play it, since there is a big chance you will like it. This just was not for me sadly.","Mar 31, 2021 at 4:12 AM",2, 3,

You run out if inventory space almost immediately, most of the quests and challenges just pop up out of nowhere with zero explanation what to do or where to go and some of the puzzles are so incredibly bad, that even though they are simple to solve, the fact that the game is vr and the time in which your companions react (if they will react at all) is RNG, making it very frustrating.","Mar 22, 2021 at 6:16 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 17:52:51.451826,shm1007,An Inspiring Precursor to Future Games,"[Main Campaign and Most Side Quests Completed : Played on an Oculus Rift S]
It's rare to see full games built for VR, but that's exactly what Asgard's Wrath is. A fantasy game built around deep lore elements and beautiful worlds. 
Let's talk good notes. First off, the game is straight up beautiful to look at and you can see the time the artists and designers took to make immersive scenery. From intricate character design leaning into the Norse Lore to the detailed backgrounds, you can really feel like you are there. The sound design brought life to the bright tavern and darkness to the dusty barrows. 
Onto the meh. Combat is very middle of the road in AW and its obviously designed to be easy to get good at. Once you get an understanding of any enemies moveset  they stop posing a large threat. Despite this, the combat feels very personal and some enemies can punish being unfocused. The RPG mechanics of the game feel rudimentary. This game is the same level of RPG as GTA V. Once you complete the story line you can just waltz back through and do any quests or challenges you need to.

Onto the negative notes: The boss battles in AW are underwhelming. While its cool to get a whole dedicated bossfight, several of the fight mechanics felt too simple for a ""Boss"". As other people have mentioned as well, this game is huge and the load times on the Rift S could go up to 5 minutes. Especially having to jump between the hub and any adventure space. My biggest problem though is that there is a lack of features that we take to be commonplace in rpgs. I have a broken side quest that I would abandon or revert a save on to fix in other games. In the menus, it would be great to have a bulk craft feature. Also, this is an exclusive, which due to certain choices by Facebook could mean negative consequences for the player base.
While this game doesn't excel at being an RPG game, it is a great VR RPG game. VR prides itself on the immersiveness, and AW does just that to an amazing degree.","Feb 9, 2021 at 12:42 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 17:52:54.593423,squire_james,Best VR RPG so far,"So further to my original review and having played more VR games I would like to add: This is hands down the best VR RPG at the moment and probably the best VR game at the moment. Absolutely brilliant. 

However, to the developers: 
May I suggest moving your game over to steam VR, recent developments on Oculus/Facebook are leaving customers such as myself deeply unhappy. We bought into Oculus as a platform for playing VR games, not for pushing Facebook's social media nonsense. For the time being I will not buy games on Oculus store and my next headset is very unlikely to be Oculus; consequently if you had released this game now or in the future I would not be likely to play it (a huge shame in my opinion).

Original review:
Fantastic graphics, VR-mechanics and gameplay with a fun story. This I think represents the first fully formed VR RPG and I hope to see many games like this in the future.

Another positive is that wilst the game has comfort options it does not force them on you. It allows  you to use free moving and turning with the control-sticks without snapping/teleporting or vignetting. This for me is the most immersive currently and I do not suffer from motion sickness, so this is perfect for me.","Nov 7, 2020 at 11:20 PM",5, 372,

But there are so many downsides to this game, I don't understand why so many websites are giving it 9+/10.
I have quite a few minor gripes: The voice acting is quite bad, with maybe one exception. You can't skip the blacksmith's animation, which is just long enough to be annoying. Enemies keep respawing, even after you defeat the area boss and the area has been 'revitalized'. The game takes up 120GB of space, which seems a bit nuts. The Metroidvania mechanic of sending you back to old areas once you unlock a new character/companion ability...well so far it doesn't seem to be used for anything interesting. Crafting is a pain, and grinding for ingredients in a VR game is REALLY annoying.
Two bigger gripes: First, the combat is bad. Very bad. It is monotonous, the enemies are bland, the controls feel clunky, the parry mechanic seems fairly hit or miss, and the runic armour mechanic for enemies is downright obnoxious. I just don't enjoy the combat. Second, instead of creating your own character and building them like in most RPGs, you are forced to play as existing characters. OK, annoying. But the kicker is that just as you've finished upgrading that character and getting used to them, you finish their 'saga' and it's time for a brand new one. I'm on my third, and so far I don't really like any of them.
Maybe this would have been better if they'd leaned more into puzzles and less into combat. But if I hadn't gotten this for free with the Quest 2/Link deal, I'd be asking for a refund.","Feb 19, 2021 at 9:32 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 17:53:04.061101,ken.hutch,Problematic  buggy mess,"The game seems cool but there are 3 points that to me make it bottom tier instead of the top tier game I expected it to be,

1 - Stuttering
I am on a Ryzen 7 3700 x, 32gb 3600 bdie 16 cl ram, the newest samsung m2...980 or whatever, and an MSI 5700x 8gb.  I can play any game I have at usually ultra, but somtimes high.  This on, no level is playable without some stuttering.  More importantly, its not consistent.  At times I can play on high at 100%, others I cannot.  At times even low is full of stuttering.  If playing on high and the stuttering is bad, dropping to low changes nothing.  I have started running monitoring to see if this related to heat, cores, or some rogue open program...its not.  To me, something is just wrong in how this game handles data. Which leads me to my next issue.

2 - Closing
This game will not close.  Either by using the Oculus menu, or the game menu, exiting this app does not close it...its still running wrath.exe in the background.  In the library screen, quitting also does not close the app.  The only way to stop the app is to end the process in task manager.  To me that is a red flag of a program handling something incorrectly. 

3 - Parrying
Its quite possible this mechanism gets easier, but for me at this point, it's very inconsistent and bothersome. When its working, it makes combat pretty fun, but to often it just does not work.  Against normal attacks, not the ones you cannot parry, I do not swing or hold, I basically push to where the attack is coming from when its coming.  Its hit or miss if this works or not, timed or not.

I see none of these issues on any other game.  Seems to me on at least point 1 and 2, this game has some sort of flaw.  Maybe if you are one of the lucky choosen that got a 16gb card at retail these issues do not affect the gameplay.  I had to pay the same retail cost of a 6800 for a 5700...maybe next year right?","Feb 2, 2021 at 10:17 AM",2, 0,

Due to non existing physic I was not feeling as the part of this world at all  - you can move your hands/weapons/items through everything, weapons are weightless, the most effective battle move is to rotate your wrists right and left. The worst is the developers were aware of those flaws, for some enemies they are disabling the collisions so your attacs can have effect only at very precise moments of enemy animation - despite the fact they should be cutted by your sword many times in between.

The new characters make it intersesting and different to master which adds to the unique challenges and keeps things interesting and fresh during long gameplay.

My only real complaint is that I can't get enough seeds. Seeds depend on others play...and dying...my whole play through i had enough for two flowers...after doing everything else and going back to finish side missions...I still have three left to get...where are all these dead players at?

2022-05-28 17:53:10.361250,Kunakai,I really wish I liked this game more,"It does a lot right (especially the intro). That said it also does a lot wrong. 

The ability to turn into a god overlooking the map is cool. Unfortunately the character action and puzzle aspects feel lacking. Melee combat feels wafty in many regards. I really wasn't sure if I was parrying correctly or if there was any point to parrying in most cases. The puzzles feel like 70% of the actual gameplay, by which I mean trying to figure out what the game wants you to do leaves you standing scratching your head more often than interacting with different things in different ways. 

Object interaction is another aspect the game feels a bit hit and miss on. Handling objects in the world feels more akin to clicking on something opposed to grabbing it (in contrast to something like Half Life Alyx which handles such things exceptionally).

The story follows a god like entity taking orders from Loki. Little of actual interest seems to happen throughout, you progress through linear levels collecting materials ocasionally taking a side path (to collect more materials) before progressing to another area of much the same design with a different layer of paint.  

As far as graphic fidelity goes this game is probably among the best. VO is well executed but the character writing is bland and uninspired more often than not.

Last night I tried to download Google again and it worked, not changing anything on my PC. 
So I gave this another chance and it worked. And I am glad I did. Played for about 4 hours straight and had a hard time putting it down. Gameplay is fun, and the graphics are really nice. Have to say I like it more than Alyx Half Life. Absoulutely recommend this.","Nov 3, 2020 at 12:18 PM",5, 23,
2022-05-28 17:53:13.554709,Zoobley,Highly Highly recommend,"This game is fantastic. The AAA quality really shines through. Level graphics and design, sound design, just the sheer magnitude of the environment. I enjoy my time in the game and look forward to coming back each and every time. 
Things I really love: 
-the followers, man they did such a good job of making if feel natural to toss your followers snacks and food. 
-sound and vibration design: first game where ive noticed they combined both beautifully. When something heavy drops or walk near you, it makes you feel the weight of that creature. 
-Combat- this is a love hate. At first I hated the parry effect, but quickly relized sword fighting is boring without it. You can just swing your arm quickly like in beatsaber and do a million damage with zero effort. Glad they implemented it. 
-Stories and voice acting- top notch. I am genuinely interested in the stories and charachter and each one is unique

Not so good- 
Fighting- while I still enjoy it, it does get a bit repititious. Also due to the ruinic armor it effectivly makes ranged weapons pointless. Also fighting multiple enemies is really just one on one since you cant parry them all at the same time. 

Item management- Not super intuitive. Grabbing stuff on your body is great but for potions and what not I end up having to exit into the menu to access the supplies that way. 

All in all i'm probaly 20-30 hours into the game and only about half way through and this is one of my all time favorite games. Lots of playback with all the challenes an upgrading of gear. I really like it. I hope these Dev's are working on new projects because it's just going to get better from here!","Sep 28, 2020 at 8:53 PM",5, 118,
2022-05-28 17:53:13.575654,ChuckJohnson,Game is broken,"The game is very cool...when it works. Combat was boring at first, but became very fun as the game progressed. The visuals are fantastic. This game has some very strong rpg elements as well. I was really looking forward to completing the game.

However, the game became unplayable, literally.  I got about 5 hours into the game and transported to Asgard to drop off materials and the game froze at this point. Now when I enter the load screen, the game freezes. Every single time. I have tried about 30 times. The game freezes and my headset turns off each time I try to load my data. 

I told Occulus about it, but they pretty much told me ""oh well too bad for you"". They wanted me to uninstall, start a new game, get 5 hours into the game, and see if the problem happens again. I'm just not going to spend 5 hours doing that. So I am out $40 now, which is fine, I'll survive. I don't think it is unfair though to expect a full price Occulus marketed game to function. $40 is too expensive for a game that is going to black screen and have these kind of issues. Especially a game from Occulus Studios. I hope you see this so you too don't flush $40 down the toilet. I also am now kind of scared to buy other games on Occulus because of this. I have never had any other problems with games from the Occulus store, but this one was the expensive one. I'd be much more forgiving if this happened with a $10 game.","Nov 22, 2020 at 6:37 PM",1, 10,
2022-05-28 17:53:13.597594,TheHood2003,Awesome game,"The game is probably the second best VR game of all-time (#1 is HL:Alyx ofc), but I sadly had to give it only 4 stars because the ranged weapons in the game are pretty much useless. If an enemy has a Runic armor (most of 'em has) you can't kill the enemy using only a ranged weapon. U have to break their Runic shield in melee combat and after that you can use your ranged weapon to shoot a couple shots until the enemy dies. Really on that point it's just dumb to change the weapon so you end up killing the enemy fully in melee. Also u can't deal any damage (even on the armor) before u parry an enemy's special attack which means that there's a lot of waiting on enemies' attacks especially when you have to parry them twice or even more times.","Dec 2, 2020 at 10:23 PM",4, 6,

I have a pretty good PC and it stuttered too much to  play and have fun . Even in the tavern , it's even worst than my micro-stutters I had on SteamVr ... running both portals at the same time for Quest 2 usage.

It's well well made , I like it , I like the concept but unable to have fun stuttering each some frames .... and reducing details etc don't seem to help. Half Life Alyx runs pretty nice on my Ryzen 8 cores but Asgard'S Wrath doesn't seem to use them wisely at all. 

Still like the fact I had this game as a promotion for free but ... It's not optimized at all at my point of view . Could be soooo much stable .

This game brings a true, full length RPG experience to VR, complete with quests, exploration, crafting, gear, and a good story. Being thrown into Norse mythology, among and against gods, monsters, animal followers, and more was a great experience. It was the first game I consistently was running out of battery on and waiting for my next chance to play. Combat is difficult but difficulty can be changed. Some puzzles were just challenging enough or areas hard enough to solve that it felt like an accomplishment. And the use of VR controls (eating, pulling levels, high diving a follower, tossing potions to someone else, mini games, etc) all added nice immersion. I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a full length VR game.","Feb 27, 2021 at 10:04 AM",5, 2,

Also, the loading sections are long enough that I actually look for something else to do while I wait. Breaks my game up when I am standing there just waiting on the load to finish.

(*Oculus Support -> You rock!!)

** Update **

After playing through most of the game the first time through the maps... I wish I could get a refund. Seriously disappointed.

Repeating enemies, so once you figure out how the weakness, you carve through them without any effort. Puzzles everywhere!! You cant do anything without going through puzzles, its constant and one after another after another. Buy this game, I hope you love VR puzzles! And you have to constantly switch followers in order to, you guessed it, solve puzzles!!

This game starts out great, I loved every second of it. But as you go through, you are faced with puzzles constantly, and you cant move forward till you solve the puzzles. So play puzzle fighter, or quit playing, there is NO CHOICE. You must play the puzzle games at every turn.

And yes, there are a lot of glitches to go with this game also. Materials fall outside of your reach a lot, so you dont get your loot. You can only carry a limited number of items, like 1 of something, so when three are dropped at one fight... yeah, you dont get your loot. I will be playing and my arm will stretch way out and around, though it was my controler, but then saw a couple NPCs do it for a moment.

*sighs*  A very disappointing game. Too late for a refund, but thats where I am with it, just want my money back. I didnt want a VR puzzle game. Worst game on VR. Terrible controls, limited movement, limited actions... I hate even giving this one star, it doesnt deserve even one star.

DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE!!

2022-05-28 17:53:45.173141,FleshyMonkey,"Fantastic visuals, mediocre gameplay","From the moment this game started, I was like, ""OH YEAH!  This is gonna be GREAT!"" The visuals are grand and immersive.  But as the tutorial progressed, I started thinking more and more, ""This is like a Disney ride. Cool stuff to see, and they want to make you feel involved, like ""Everybody point your wands and shout ""Wingardium Leviosah!"" and whether you do it or not, the thing the ride operator is pointing at floats to the sky.  You know?  It's this gorgeous, cheesy level of involvement, from parrying the ships thrown at you by the kraken to fighting it, to going to the pub afterward and not really being able to interact with anyone... but it gets better right?  Well, sure... but not that much.  You can turn an animal into your companion, but I think your only option is a shark -- once again the game handholds you into getting what it wants you to get.  From that point on, pretty much every puzzle in the ensuing dungeon is solved by pointing at some corpse in a cage and telling your shark buddy to go jump up and bite it, thereby pulling it down to open some gate or reveal some secret entrance.  Immersed in the gorgeousness though I was, I started getting bored -- and motion sick.  I don't get sick easily in VR, but the movement in this game for some reason has me gobbling Dramamine like M&Ms, and ultimately, it just hasn't been worth it so far.  Does it get way better?  Maybe.  I find myself just not wanting to play anymore to find out.","Oct 29, 2020 at 12:19 PM",3, 1,

1) Nice stories (for the different heroes) and a lot of content.
2) Characters are great. The companions have different personality and talking with the other gods and semi-gods are so much fun.
3) Graphic is definitive AAA. Make sure you have it installed on your SSD.
4) Sounds are perfect and the German localization is excellent.
5) The fights, oh yeah, the fights. Many users complain about it. And it´s really hard to understand and learn how to parry and reply. I needed quite a couple of hours to master it. But now it´s so rewarding. But if you like to hammer the buttons und just slash without thinking you should not buy this game. It will frustrate you, as you can read in all the reviews of users who were not able to learn the fighting style.
6) The game always gives you motivation to continue playing, as with new heroes, new companions, new equipment, new riddles, even with new boss fights in areas you already finished, because they will be populated again.

All in all: If you like RPGs and a challenging (not unfair) fighting style, this game alone would be worth buying a VR headset. Very well done...","Jun 30, 2020 at 6:32 PM",5, 196,

I'm really amazed with this experience .. This is how VR games are supposed to be .. Full immersed experience with full utilization of VR capabilities .. This is a game that stays in your mind for years to come. 
Graphics are another level .. some of the scenes and places look as good as a hologram .. it was smooth on 2080Ti .. but some crowded scenes had minor chopping (rare, but did happen) .. 
Sound effects and music are beautiful and fits the experience .. 
Nature of quests and difficulty is very balanced and gives you choices .. Example: You can focus on collecting items to upgrade your gear, on just focus on collecting cash then you buy the parts from vendors .. so it fits different styles of play .. If you play easy, then you are OK with main quests .. but if you want more challenge, then you need to do some more side quests to improve your gear faster and be up to the challenge .. 
What I loved the most is the idea of the companion animals .. I believe 10 animals is a bit overkill though .. I think 5 or 6 should've been enough as some of them aren't used as much .. nevertheless, the idea is amazing .. 

I highly recommend this for anybody with Rift/Rift-S and good graphics card .. It's a must-have ..","Jul 26, 2020 at 2:25 PM",5, 15,

For me, the game was at first unplayable due to the horriable stuttering and Frame drops but after I updated my drivers that issue was gone.  The game is amazing and so well designed, just make sure that you have a powerful enough computer to handle it!

I took a star off because as amazing as the game is I found myself just constantly getting stuck in the game not knowing where to go next.  Once or twice through the game would have been fine but it seemed like every couple hours I would come across a spot where I just didn't know what I needed to do next to progress the game and it got really annoying.

The skill based melee combating was especially unique, there are loads of different ways to beat an opponent.  
The very first opening sequence was what VR was made for, my jaw dropped to the floor. 
Criticism is that the in game sequence is quite linear, after the 3rd or so hero it became predictable but still fun. Games are about having fun, and I had fun.
The interface and switching and exchange of weapons was natural, the combat was most enjoyable.  
Puzzles was not too hard, even for me that avoid games with puzzles. 
Graphics jaw dropping, the feathers of the eagle hero was visible. One of the modt beautiful looking games ever, flat screen included and VR word maker it even more real. Being stared at by a statue was so real I had goosebumps!
Sound design, absolutely great.  Sound create atmosphere and can compensate for what is lacking in graphical finesse.

The combat is pretty obnoxious, but not entirely terrible (gripe 1 - unless playing on easy, many enemies are invincible until they finally decide to make a special move and you successfully parry it; gripe 2 - your attacks stun enemies, but they'll sometimes recover instantly in order to perform a headbutt that doesn't seem to be parryable). 

The graphics are fine, but slightly on the lower end compared to some other VR titles or even VR ports of games like Fallout or Hellblade.

 The story so far looks like it has potential, but not much has happened yet; only veeeery loosely based on Norse mythology.

I pushed this on off at the time because I really just wanted to play the other games I got. I had started the game in the middle of my hlvr playthrough and didn't get too far into the game, mostly because it looked so bad. The reason it looked so bad was that I was streaming it to my quest into another room, but I wasn't getting those visual problems with my other games at all. So a month after I got the game I decided to try the game teathered for the first time, I got it set up just to see what it would look like, so I just got a sort of short charging cable for my phone and set up a really small play space. And at that moment I had realized what I had been missing out on. Gosh this game looks and plays so well. I've been playing the game so much recently and I've been enjoying it so my, everytime I meet with my friends I bring up the game and just start drooling about it. I love the combat so much, at first I was really sad that it wasn't like the combat in boneworks, but this 1to1 combat is extremely fun, I'm able to play this game in such a tiny space and its fine, but sometime i'll get too immersed and i'll get close to unplugging the quest. I havent finished the game yet, but i'm at the old man. What has kinda bitten me in the butt is that I really haven't been playing attention to the story too much, I'd say it's good, but I really don't know. But what I do know is that the story is better than boneworks for sure. One part of the game that I find impressive are the lighting effects, the reflections, shadows, and flares just look so good.

Make sure you run this on a SSD, HDD will stutter like hell. I had to move the files around and after that textures popped in before the scenes were ready. This is what causes stutter as the game seems to load things on demand.

2022-05-28 17:54:29.592335,ZVB73,Disappointing,"When I saw a trailer for this game, it convinced me to try VR. I bought a Quest and a cable that's link compatible. When I tried this game, it was so buggy and stuttery that it was almost unplayable. I have a good system, so there's no reason for it to run this poorly when other demading games play well. The level design is okay, but the combat is also a sore spot for me. The number of times I went to parry and it didn't register was a little ridiculous. The breaking point was the boss battle with Tyr at the end of chapter one. It was having a horrible time registering that I was pulling the bow, so it just fundamentally didn't work. I don't know if these issues were an issue with the Quest, but the fact that no other game I have played had these issues is a pretty good indicator to me it's not the quest. I tried so hard to enjoy this game because it should be for me, and apparently it's for many people given the sales figures and the reviews, but it was just a mess that seemed not fully developed. I wasn't expecting Elder Scrolls 6 or anything, but I was expecting a game that worked. Very disapponted it didn't click for me because I knew this was the one. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's not the worst, but it wasn't too playable for me.","Jun 11, 2020 at 7:41 AM",2, 7,

-Excellent graphics, sound, voice acting
-Solid VR implementation (with 1 exception in cons)
-TONS of content
-Feels like a real AAA game
-Lots of puzzles, secrets, and exploration if you enjoy those
-Great selection of options and customization features

Neutral
-Nice selection of different followers, but they aren't very helpful apart from puzzles
-Nice selection of different heroes, but at the same time limits how much you can customize any given one
-Upgrading things can get pretty grindy

Cons
-Using items in combat doesn't pause/slow time (minor complaint)
-Some crashes (minor complaint because the game does a great job autosaving)
-The combat is either ridiculously easy with no challenge at all (Normal mode) or extremely tedious and unimmersive due to runic (invincibility) armor.  This is the only major complaint, but as over half the game is about combat, its a huge negative and really ruined much/most of my enjoyment of an otherwise fantastic game.  First off, normal difficulty offers no challenge at all.  None.  Zero.  The other two difficulty modes add what feels like purely artificial/contrived challenge by making certain enemies mostly invincible until you wait for them to do certain moves and then parry those.  Once you get the hang of it (or just wiggle around certain weapons really fast) it doesn't add any real challenge, it is just boring and tedious.

I wasted my £30. Just jumped in expecting something exceptional after reading reviews. Jeez what were they playing before they played this and found it so goodThis game reminds me of a text only RPG but this time with decent visuals Every time you start the game you have to hold your hands out to calibrate your controllers. Why! Other games don’t ask for this. Every time !!!

The fight tutorials at the start are so frustrating. You have to watch a “how to”  demo first then you get the chance to try. If you fail the attempt it resets and you have to sit through the demo again! You cant skip. You must pass the tutorial. Why?! What a frustrating pain in the ... The animation of some of the characters is meh
The game look good as long as you don’t go up to anything to touch it or try interacting. There’s nothing to touch unless its on the storyline and you need to interact with it.
The interaction with the level furniture or props is non existent. Like when you grasp at something and your hand just passes through it or when you have your sword and shield in hand and expect them to clash when you strike them together but they don’t. Simple details for a decent developer
Floor textures are flat with the odd tuft of grass poking up through the flat surface
When you walk to the edge of a drop your character just stops and slightly hovers over the edge like there is some invisible barrier. You cant walk off a surface and drop down to a platform or even your own death for being so stupid.  Meh! 
Your standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs.  Glide up or teleport up. Thats it no animation or different sound effect. Standin at the bottom of a ladder you can only teleport to the top. How crap is that in a premium game","May 19, 2020 at 9:36 PM",1, 16,

The story, is there. Unless you're a massive Nordic mythology buff, its meh at best. Personally not my thing, but I knew this going in, so no minus points for this. I was hoping for good gameplay, which bring me to the big crux that takes this game down.

The combat, oh dear god, the combat. I've not seen such horrible combat since the Nintendo Wii, and god some of those were bad. How bad? Just wiggle. And I can hear you think: ""Well I don't have to wiggle, I can just pretend to have a normal sword and strike normally for full immersion."" Yeah, no playing the game properly is such a clear worse strategy and you get punished for it with its ""Wait to be attacked"" mechanics. 
Just attack? Nope he has a helmet and no other armor, so he's immune to attacks so you have to wait for him to do a specific attack so you can parry it.  And of course parry doesn't always connect properly. You also have a helper, but unless you're sporting a specific potion, he is pretty much useless in combat.

Now why does this merit 1 star? Because over half of the game consists of combat, any fun and immersion is consistently and constantly broken by combat. Meaning that every time you are getting immersed and enjoying the game you will immediately be taken out of it by the horrible broken combat.

TLDR; Reasonable game, but combat breaks it massively","May 16, 2020 at 7:10 AM",1, 9,

After playing just one hour of this game, I already like it.  To say much attention has been given to detail is an understatement.  It does take a little getting used to the controls and gameplay, but so far so good.  With what I've read of other reviews, I figure there's much MUCH more to learn about and do in this game.  There also seems to be a loooong laundry list of achievements, which should keep anyone occupied for a while.
If I were to put a rating on this experience so far, its right up there with the likes of Lone Echo, Robo Recall, Gunheart and Stormland (all great AAA titles).  The polish on THIS title take the visuals to a WHOLE OTHER LEVEL and are very beautiful, from what I've seen so far.
Transitioning to god-mode was a great experience and I hope I'm not wrong in saying that this title is the first to offer 2 perspectives in a single game while maintaining interaction with the environment/characters.

**** UPDATE ****
Now several hours into the game and having gotten the hang of it, I AM HOOKED.  This game keeps me coming back... and I like that I can take my time to FULLY explore every nook and cranny, which is rewarding on so many levels.  Add to all this that there are also a plethora of side quests to keep things interesting.
You guys have a gem on your hands and I'm glad I took the plunge to find out for myself what EVERYONE was raving about.

BUT... boy, do I love it.  I played (BADLY) WOW off and on for years, and this one could really be evolved (with great ease) into VR WOW.  I STOPPED playing WOW because it was just ultimately so repetitious -- just doing everything over and over again, but as a 100 instead of as a 90, etc....  SO I actually LIKE that AW has an ""end"" to it (almost as much as I like that I am still nowhere NEAR that end!).  I never thought I would ever quest and farm crafting mats again, but I am doing all of that and more with gusto in AW.  The combat (which I still suck at) is hella fun, and the puzzle challenges and novel ""games within a game"" are all very inventive and fun, just as WOW is at its best (or WAS, anyway... dunno these days!).  I'm loving the companions with their special skills.  Loving ""God Mode,"" where you tower 100 feet above the landscape you've been traversing and can make some moves you cannot manage ""on the ground.""  (This aspect is somewhat reminiscent of Moss.)  The game is very intricate and well thought out, and... well sword and sorcery RPG has always been my milieu, and this one is a total triumph so far.  (Kind of like what that Skyrim port MIGHT have been, maybe, if that had not been such a lame port.  This is no port, it's VR from the ground up, and it is truly mega-enhancing my covid confinement!)  I've played, and enjoyed, about 10-20 VR games over the past 18 months, and this one is the winner so far -- it's brilliantly conceived and executed, and it's LONG (esPECially if you suck, but even otherwise, at least comparatively).  

And a final note for my fellow bad players: AW death is quite gentle and painless.  No corpse runs, and any mats you expended in your losing fight are refunded upon revival.   So jump right in and fear not!","Apr 30, 2020 at 8:50 AM",5, 3,

But what I can ABSOLUTELY NOT UNDERSTAND, is that despite the fact I have a fairly beefy PC, that I have it running on the lowest graphical settings for EVERYTHING, that I have supersampleing at the optimal settings, that I have all other background tasks and apps closed, AND that my drivers are up to date... I can only squeeze 10 fps out of this game... IF I'M LUCKY. the game freezes every other step I take. I cant swing my arms, move, or turn my head without causeing it to freeze for a few seconds. Naturally, battles are vituably unwinnable bevause of this, especially in the pink spirit trials. I often find myself just holding down the joystick, frozen in place, hoping to dodge, and suddenly being shown my corpse. As it turns out, movment is important in a first person melee, and statues are an easy target. But the villiage is BY FAR the worst. in a game where the enemys are capable of landing devastating lethal blows that need to be dodged at a moments notice, and are INVINCIBLE, until a percision parry is landed, frame rate is...well... KIND OF IMPORTANT. not to mention, that each of these (extremely numerous) deaths are then followed by ANOTHER LOADING SCREEN (although these ones are only about 2/3 as long as the original ones) Even in reletivly simple environments like loki's training arena, I get only 30 fps MAX, AND IT STILL FREEZES. I've looked up tutorials for this, and followed them all, with only minimal improvements. I would love to love this game, but until these MAJOR ISUUES are fixed...

The combat is absolutely attrocious(air tickle fest). There is no feedback on any part of combat(besides throwing axes which feels kinda cool but not there). There is no weight to any of the weapons you use in this game. Absolutely no physics. RPG mechanics are tedious and boring( Im an avid RPG fan since BG1) There was one fight where I felt cool, besides the opening. The story is boring. The follower mechanic is tedious and boring to me. I get that its so you HAVE to use all of your followers, but its just tedious. Being able to thumbs up your follower and them noticing and replying is very cool. Or the fist bumping.

I preordered the game with high hopes of leading to an amazing gameplay. But all I've had for the couple of days is the game closing itself randomly because I open Oculus Dash or the loading screen finishes whatever it was doing. The loading screen takes me 10minutes to finish, I started the game at 11:28 and entered midgard and I'm still waiting to get in and it's  11:39am now. I downloaded the game on my HDD drive so it would he faster but it always take ages to load. And even when I do make it, it crashes itself from time to time. I'm not sure even waiting to preordering this thing was a good idea to begin with.

Navigate to C:\Users[your username]\AppData\Local\WrathGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\GameUserSettings.ini

    r.TemporalAACurrentFrameWeight=0.2

    r.TemporalAASamples=16

    r.TemporalAASharpness=1.0

and this to scalibility.ini

    [PostProcessQuality@3]

    r.DefaultFeature.AntiAliasing=2

and in the gameusersettings.ini

    sg.PostProcessQuality=3

seems to make the taa a lot less blurry with these settings.

Edit: You can also try r.TemporalAASharpness=2.0 r.Tonemapper.Sharpen=2.0 to make it even sharper, and it seems to exponentially get better with more supersampling. On the rift you can use the oculus debug tool to do this.

Not sure if the game-devs can do something about this, or whether it's an occulus issue though.

You'll see people talking about AAA game studios making immersive games like Skyrim VR that they charge $60 and can't even make it VR interactive.  This game was built for VR from the ground up.  It's got a great story, great combat, cool visuals, and lots to do.  It could be easily sold for $60, at $40 its a great bargain.

------
Okay after some months pause, upgrading my PC to a 3700X (with 32GB RAM, Vega 64) the game performance is still bad to average. I also asked a friend who has a RTX2080 TI watercooled, same problems. You can't even play on high without getting for instance blurry hands while moving them fast.. everything feels like you drunk too much, so back to mid settings. 
The battle system is just the same over and over, block no.. maybe smart hitting and outplaying the enemy noo.. you have to parry .. hit them.. parry hit them.. parry, hit and so on.. 
I really try to love this game and I gave them time to fix the issues but after 6 months the game is still far from polished. Everything feels like forced and not loved.. there are VR games where I play 2-3 hours a session and forget to eat.. but this game I want to quit after 30 minutes.. 
The game has great potential but its not loved and don't expect updates from the devs which will improve the game.. 
I'm disappointed.. and somehow I will force me to finish the story at least.","Apr 22, 2020 at 3:14 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:55:10.864946,Avhaari,I dont get where the hype is from,"The game is mediocre at best and i tried to like it.

Ill give the reasons why the game didnt work for me.

tl;dr: Loading is long enough to alt tab and watch youtube and when its done its laggy the first time you meet anything cause it hasnt been loaded correctly. 
Combat goes from Interesting to tedious before you even really get into the game. Throwing accuracy feels off. Allies get in the way. Tutorials are given after you are forced to learn it yourself. Parry hardly works.

First of all the tutorials not showing you how to dodge until you are a few hours in is just weird. The time between tutorials is odd as i started trying out things because the game wouldnt give me a tutorial. When i suddenly did get a tutorial (Ally boost elixer) it felt too late.

The swordfighting is amusing for a short while, then you realize that parry'ing hardly works. When you stand too close to an enemy and try to parry them you might accidentally hit them causing you to miss your parry. 
If you can do anything with your screen white half the time cause they just spam 
 knockback at you.

At first i thought ill time it better, but nope. now your chugging potions waiting for their rage to kick up again enough so you can attempt to remove their armor. And when you do you are so bored of all the waiting you just wristflick your sword to get the enemy down.

If you choose a melee ally, i only got 3 when i decided to drop the game, they get in the way preventing you from seeing the enemy casting their blue heavy attack cause they're blue all the time cause your ally just keeps mashing into them.

Now you missed it and have to wait again for it to charge up.

Its unfortunate cause the story seems as if it might become interesting, i just cba to continue because of the mechanics of the game.","Apr 18, 2020 at 11:13 PM",2, 3,

I have a $900 PC with a 3gb GTX 1060 and I face load times from 3 to 10 minutes on my measly 220gb SSD that I had to spend 3 hours trying to get this massive game onto, and once it finally loads the textures of this game are extremely lazily compressed to make everything look like absolute trash since the standard textures dont fit into my RAM. I found myself getting constantly confused at what to do in game mainly because of these horrible textures and lack of immersion. In combat the general premice of how it works is fine, but i found myself constantly accidentally grabbing weapons when reaching in the quick menu for heals, and every blue-colored attack varies wayy to much at how soon they will hit you, so some attacks might be pretty good to try to parry and others you will only have time to flick your wrist a tiny bit and thus not parrying it, immediately getting hit for all your health. Progression is fine and weapons are for the most part pretty fun to use the times I actually hit 90 FPS.","May 7, 2020 at 12:30 PM",2, 0,

What made me really hate this game is that puzzles became a chore, and since some really amazing games in VR are just puzzle games the association of puzzles from this experience has soured others for me.  


The world they created is beautiful and I really wanted to go out and explore it. 
However they filled it with puzzles.


The combat isn’t rewarding, so no character progression (killing enemies doesn’t level up your character or anything). The only way to level up is collecting drops to your inventory is filled then returning to the game hub to store them. Eventually you’ll have enough materials for the recipe to upgrade to the next level. 

The options for difficulty in this game are basically too easy or boring. 
In boring some enemies are invulnerable, shielded by a barrier that only breaks if the enemy decides to do their one move that allows you to parry. In some cases they just spam unblockable attacks on the spot (not even targeted at you) while you're just standing off to the side waiting for them to snap out of it. 
Easy doesn’t have shields so just run up and hit them really fast. Your followers are supposed to help but they don’t really.

The puzzles are not rewarding. Something in the game has an icon for one of your followers so you switch to that follower and select that something. For example there is a follower that only exists to get things behind bars, so for some areas there are little rooms behind bars that have a key you need to progress.

There's tons of missions that have no point. I went about collecting all these seeds for this massive world tree and nothing happened. Not even so far as a voice line. You complete all the missions for the black smith and at the end there is just a text that says no more missions available.

So much potential in this game. What happened?","Mar 29, 2020 at 10:41 AM",2, 6,

I spent 44 hours and I had several epic moments in this game. The ending was especially good. However, it has a lot of repetitive gameplay. The runic armor combat system was nice at first, but then towards the second half of the game, it becomes a total slog to go through several enemies in a row with several chunks of runic armor that you have whittle away at. Some of the puzzles are really good, but most of them are just too simple and a few are just annoying as hell, especially those that require quick & precise throwing aim.

I enjoyed the majority of this game. It's good overall, but just falls short of being great. For every epic moment, I also had one where I felt very frustrated, especially when dealing with some of the bugs in the game (errors). For me it's just a 4/5 star game, not GOTY material.

With the gameplay i encountered game breaking bugs during combat in which when i would equip a weapon in the inventory menu and then re-enter combat the game would only render one of the lenses and begin to stutter and then crash (even with a  high end pc).  As a result when leaving the inventory menu you are unable to equip an weapon to defend yourself with out the game crashingThe combat features a hot menu bar which is useless  as you can't move and navigate the bar to select what you want during combat. There is also a god button that's never used in combat and i wish you could re-map the x and y button to a favorites buttons like health potion and full health potion so you wouldn't have to pause the game every 10 seconds to heal yourself. No ebb and flow to the gameplay. Game has poor optimization. Even on a 9900x @4.7 ghz 2080ti hybrid on an m2 with 32 gb ram if would see dropped frames all the settings were on medium. I then tested and found out the shadow setting was the culprit i could have all the settings on low and shadows on medium and i would get dropped frames which means the game is poorly coded. Technical issues and gameplay aside the story wasn't good either and very minimal. I found the looting tedious and game to be very linear in upgrades that were available. Didn't feel like a true rpg no reall skill or ability tree or decision in it its narrative. I experienced about 40 or so crashes during my 50 hour play through which is atrocious.

This is a beautifully crafted RPG. It is linear, at least so far, I'm four hours in. 

You have two perspectives, mortal and god, and I have to say the latter node really illustrates the fidelity of the game's visual crafting. Most VR games I've tried have been lighter weight in graphics compared to something like Assassin's Creed Odyssey. This one is not. Your companions can be examined closely and they're just beautifully modelled, textured and animated. And, tbf really engaging. 

Combat is solid, works well even with my old oculus setup with two sensors a bit ranomdly placed. Sword, sword and shield, dual wield swords are all possible. And throwing axes doesn't get old so far. 

The inventory seems misleading if you can't equip an item - you merely have to grab your item and exit the inventory. 

If you like rpg at all, or have no idea if you would, this is well worth it. 

There is a fairly decent and varied puzzle element to it and you'll need your companion's help. Also, these guys pull their weight far more than most companions I've met in other games. 

The team should be proud of how well realised their creation is. Its going to be a while before I see something quite as engaging character wise as this. And, as I mentioned, I've not see anything in VR games that is as graphically compelling - though I guess it will become the norm soon enough. 

Niggles - the only one that I notice at all, related as much to my old oculus rig and somewhat causual placement of the sensors. On the whole this game does a very good job of spatial placement, such that I end up not realising I'm no longer facing the front!  However pouches can sometimes be a bit finicky but that's been my only niggle. 

I'm sorry, I wanted to present an honest review but can't pick any real faults lol.

Oculus refund is hard as Epic Games at it worst. Can not find Purchase History page ( there is My Orders page, but no refunds in there ). Created ticket asking refund. After sending ticket got info that ticket systems is moved to other place!

2022-05-28 17:55:36.346791,SovietFridge,A feast for the eyes...,"...running low on budget. The further you progress the more obvious it becomes. It's like a lot more was initially planned than we see. Chests are not quite rewarding, wasting a key to get a potion? Exploration is mostly worth it to only see new incredibly beautiful locations. Boss fights become shorter instead of the opposite, it's like epicness is slowly deflating with story progressing.
Difficulty is poorly balanced. On medium difficulty you have to break the armor in order to kill your opponents, but on easy it's like the easiest of all easy?
""I can't carry anymore"" - is the most popular line you will hear in game.
Lacks feedback on weapon hit not only in battle but also with crates. You just wiggle through it and can't say for sure if it's a bug or a feature.
Auto equip is annoying. I want to use Siri' rocket fist, but instead I am grabbing a sword on my hip which I didn't even equip. In other words, there was not enough testing and analyzing in development of gameplay

Overall, I am fascinated. Last time I felt this way was when I was a kid playing 16-bit adventure rpgs. And I am genuinely surprised by the abscence of encountered bugs. I have PC AAA+ PTSD, you know, when you pay for expensive hardware, preorder a hyped game, and realize that you actually paid to be a beta-tester... You have to wait 2 years after release for a bugfest to become a game. And, my traumatic experience led me to a conclusion, that with vr games it will be even worse, since the audience is much much smaller(or maybe faster fixes instead because of how demanding this small audience is). But since it's single player, bugs won't be as infuriating. So I bought it and bugs were already fixed. It seems like Oculus considers itself as a gaming platform, like Playstation or Nintendo. It might be that exclusives put their reputation at stake, so Oculus exclusives are likely to become playable sooner(around few months?) after release than flat PC games. Can't be 100% sure, but we'll see.","Apr 16, 2020 at 2:27 PM",4, 0,

This is absolutely one of the best VR games ever made.  The story was engaging enough and the visuals are absolutely stunning.  I don't understand reviews that give zero stars for download issues and I wish that wasn't a thing.  In this VR world I've come across a number of player types and the ""it was boring"" crowd, usually tend to be ""those people""...the ones always looking for an issue with the games.  The fighting mechanics can be modified to your liking and there are several side quests in addition to the main story line (some folks here claim it had no story...which makes me feel like they may not have actually played it, just wanted something to complain about).  I've always loved Greek mythology and I enjoyed all of the hours I sunk into it.  Sansaru did a fantastic job and I highly recommend experiencing it for yourself vs. relying on some of these reviews.  If you hate it, refund it.

2022-05-28 17:55:45.810479,xGlaive,"An amazing title, and a must play","What to say about this title? It is what other VR titles should strive for, both mechanically and graphically. It is hugely entertaining and offers a multitude of things to do, including a quest system, a fairly complex battle system, a large selection of animal-themed allies, and multiple characters each with their own quirks.

Graphically, this game is currently second to none on VR, but you could've already guessed that with a 70+GB download and a 130GB install.

The only reason I can't give this game 5 stars is because of the Oculus software used to launch and update the game. Oculus' launcher requires you to have the full game's size in free space available on the install drive to download any updates, even if said updates amount to 1.5GB. This limitation makes updating this monster of a game extremely tedious, and, in my opinion, detracts from the experience.","Mar 10, 2020 at 4:44 AM",4, 3,

On the contrary, it is a great game. There is only one but.... I'm frustrated at this point, because I can't get past the  God that heaves havoc in the small town. I have to shoot arrows on the red balls he throws at the character, in order not to lose lifeforce, have to shoot the blue ones to hit him and then pull parts of his armor. I manage to do that, but every time I lose a lot of lifeforce. I managed to kick him a few times, but then he gets his armor back and in an instance he kills the character, having to do everything all over again. BOOOORING!. I looked for days to find a trainer, where my immortal character cannot be defeated or die. The only one I found is one I have to pay a monthly fee for. NO GOOD. Why can't the makers of the game have this mode built in? It is not a multi-player and I'ld like to enjoy the stunning graphics of the game, the puzzles and of and on the fighting. If trainers can do that, why is it not possible for Oculus or the maker of this game possible to offer this feature.

Craftingsystem is at the begining a little bit confusing but you will make it

You can spend good 40-60 hours here. I've finished the main story by now so hope my review helps from that perspective.
The story, mechanics, characters... all is great.
But there's a huge thing that almost made me rage quit multiple times a session (2-3 hours) - that is lags/freezes. Game stutters from time to time but that's beareable. What's not beareable is when game freezes or straight crashes!
Most often it happens on bosses when you move between the menu (to heal yourself) and back to the game - it'll freeze here loading for no good reason. I've monitored the resource use of my PC and it's close to 0 at this point so looks like a software glitch to me. Graphics quality is irrelevant here, I had this on max and min quality and I have core i7/ geforce 1080 / 16 GB ram setup.

The loading is atroscious, the stuttering is consant and in my initial 5 hours of playing I've spent more time in loading screens than actually playing.

When I did play the game I had constant stuttering all the time, specially during fights which resulted in a mess, the exploring portion was filled with bugs, glitches and all sorts of other issues, I've got stuck on objects several times and had to waste time on another load screen to fix it. Once my inventory was full I had to spend several minutes at 2 loading screens to go to the hall to unload inventory then to go back to playing the game.

2022-05-28 17:56:27.265601,Mirality,An absolute Must-Buy,"Buy it.  You will not regret it.

While I personally wasn't super-into the block-and-counter combat flow (and had some really frustrating battles against the first tutorial enemy that required it, mostly due to the tutorial itself being unskippable), the game does come with difficulty settings that let you tone that down (or amp it up) as you desire.

The story is both entertaining and lengthy (both a rarity for previous VR games).  As of this writing I've clocked in just over 40 hours, and while I've finished the main story and most of the side quests, there's still a few things remaining.

Another excellent aspect is that you're not playing as one character all the time -- it's broken up into chapters that each star a different hero, with different weapons, different combat styles, and different enemies and puzzles to face down.  And once you've cleared a section you can go back through with any other hero you've unlocked either just for fun or for bonus quests and collectibles.

And who would have thought I'd ever experience playing beer pong in the halls of Asgard?  Not me, but it's a great deal of fun all by itself.  (Except for the fire shots.  I never figured that one out.)","Jan 7, 2020 at 6:33 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 17:56:30.478009,alexander.horbach.9,"Great game,(no more) abysmal performance","Up until now my rig managed to run every VR game on high or ultra settings. Lone Echo was probably the only game, where I had to settle with medium settings to get good performance. 
But this game manages to run extremely poorly, even on lowest settings. 
I would really love to give this game 5 Stars and even more, because I absolutely love what I could experience so far. I could further elaborate on the beauties of Asgard´s Wrath and why it´s inarguably the best VR experience currently available, but countless other reviewers described all there is to love about this game far better than I ever could.

But to say, that this game runs poorly, would be an understatement: long loading times, stutters and arbitrary framerates. Therefore I can only give this game one measly star, but will glady change my review once performance becomes acceptable.

---UPDATE---

Performance increased dramatically since the last time I played it. Maybe it was the 1.3 Update, but most likely recent Oculus software updates fixed performance issues within the Oculus runtime (which were also caused by less recent Oculus updates). 
Therefore, the error was on my account, thinking that the game itself was the culprit when Oculus actually messed up. In retrospect, I likely came to that conclusion, because back then Asgard´s Wrath was the only game, that ran poorly on my rig while playing other demanding games at that time such as Lone Echo. 

Final conclusion:
Pros:
+Almost everything, definitely worth playing
+Only game I sat through the whole credits, because they are so awesome
Cons:
-Stale and easily exploitable combat system combined with way too many enemy hordes in order to artificially stretch playtime, which on my part mostly resulted in frequent boredom","Feb 2, 2020 at 5:36 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 17:56:39.991564,seanthagen,Game of the Year,"Perplexing that this won IGN audience award for both VR (goty) & GOTY and hardly anyone is talking about this game. Out of all of the contestants this year for GOTY: Disco Elysium, Sekiro, Control, Death Stranding - I really feel that there is no way around Asgard's Wrath as being an insurmountable achievement for both gaming & VR that will be remembered for years to come.

The only knock I can give it - I don't believe is attributed to the game itself - but is the Oculus launcher and how it installs it's games. I think I downloaded 77 gigs about four times before it installed and put me over my ISP cap which then charges me $10 for every extra 50gigs; really a huge pain trying to get this game downloaded and installed; really shouldn't be that difficult to buy & install a game!","Dec 25, 2019 at 6:44 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 17:56:40.013505,NeilChil,Problems with TAA on RIFT S,"Firstly i want to start by saying that from what ive played the game itself is very good, good combat and RPG elements with the ability to level, up not only yourself buit also your followers.  
I started playing on CV1 Rift and the game looked and played amazing on my overclocked 980Ti, it never seem to have a problem even with most of the settings on epic.
When I upgraded (or sidegraded lol) to the Rift S i went back to my game only to find it looks awful on all settings except for Low annd struggles to play smooth on medium / high.
After some research online it became clear the the problem lies with TAA on headsets that feature an LCD screen like the Rift S, on low setting everything looks crisp and clear but obviously void of any grass and effects.
Ramping up the settings to anything above low becomes a blurry mess in comparision.
The devs included no way of disabling TAA whilst allowing the extra effects of the Medium/High/Epic presets, therefore the only current solution is to edit the gameengine.ini file to make some adjustment to TAA to make it less blurry, its still not ideal but at least it becomes somewhat playable again.
Hopefully they will add an option to disable TAA or even a slider to adjust its effect in game, until that happens if you own a Rift S be warned it does not look as good as it does on the old CV1 even with reduced screen door effect.","Jan 11, 2020 at 7:27 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 17:56:46.421367,MarkusMayhem,Great game let down by tedious combat,"It's an impressive game, and visually one of the best I've seen on VR, but I feel sadly it doesn't live up to the hype.  The story is good and engaging, but I bought the game based on it's reputation as a hack and slash dungeon crawler (some reviewers even go so far as to liken it to Diablo 3).

Unfortunately the combat is what lets the game down for me.  Perhaps I've been spoiled a little bit with games like Blade & Sorcery, but the weapons feel light and certainly don't feel unique in any way.  Melee combat has no real impact.
On top of this, a lot of the battles in the game will pit you up against one or more enemies with 'ruinic armour'.  This works by essentially making them invincible until you get them angry enough to do a special move, which you then need to parry and land a follow up strike.
In theory it's a good mechanic, but in practice the game seems to rely on it to try and make encounters harder and it ends up feeling tedious.
It's further compounded by making shields more or less useless in these battles (you're better off going in with a weapon in each hand), and more often than not you'll find your follower getting in the way and making the enemy much harder to predict.

I'll give it another try soon though since I really do want to like this game, but for the moment it doesn't quite scratch the itch.","Jan 6, 2020 at 3:38 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 17:56:46.466247,Cullinarn,Asgard's Wrath as a Relaxation App,"So since there is already ample commentary on the gameplay, I'll go in a different direction with this review. I own every ""Relax and Meditate"" Experience worth playing; it is why I got into VR. I purchased Asgard's Wrath [AW] solely to enjoy the scenery; for me, any gaming value beyond that was simply a pleasant perk. Consequently, this review is SOLELY from that perspective.

The thing that attracted me to this game was the possibility of enjoying a relaxation experience (think The Impossible Travel Agency, Perfect, Guided Meditation, and, yes, even Mind Labyrinth). The difference was that I would be relaxing on the Bifrost, or in the fantasy tavern (with five save slots, yes, you can do both; indeed, you don't even need to use one for the Bifrost, as it's first up... and is ridiculously beautiful). What I didn't expect is that the God Mode would prove relaxing as well. If you liked the overworld map mode in Farlands, you will absolutely adore looking at the landscapes in AW.

I can't say enough about the visuals in this game. They aren't quite on par with the most detailed aspects of Perfect, but they are very close, and they remain smooth as you walk with a surprisingly generous freedom of movement around each environment. I probably spent twenty minutes looking out over the frozen sea outside of Aegir's Hall.

I was running this on a Rift S, with a 1080ti and an I9 7900X -- both at stock speed -- and 32 GB RAM. I was running 2.0 SS, through Oculus Tray Tool and max resolution in-game. As some others have said, you do need a somewhat beefy rig to run this on the top graphics settings smoothly; I didn't have a problem, but it is something to consider. That said, the result is absolutely gorgeous. I can tell you this: From a strictly ""Relax and Meditate"" perspective, this is easily on par with any other app, and the ability to move around and interact with the environment places it at the top. If anyone needs me, I'll be on the Bifrost, staring at the stars.","Oct 11, 2019 at 8:32 AM",5, 49,"We loved your fresh perspective on the game.

I run an older i7 3770 clocked to 4.0 GHz, 16 GB of DDR 3, MSI 1660 TI .. the game runs well but you can tell it's being pushed and the auto detected settings are at medium. It still looks better than most games set to ultra. I'll be needing to upgrade to SSD now as well. I don't mind slow load times but this beast is pushing 1-2 minutes on my old spinning 10k RPM drives. NOT a fault of the game. 

I was looking for a Fantasy RPG as I'm about done Skyrim VR and I may go into withdrawl. I've tried and returned several games on both Oculus and Steam. This one seems a keeper, and worthy of taking up the quest. 

Something to note when purchasing. The game is 77 GB to download. It took a couple of hours to download and install. For me, if I played other games while this downloaded, I had install issues. It failed twice, and I actuall had refunded and given up.  A week later I tried and again and just left the computer alone and it was successful. Just be patient with the download and install. The reward is there.

Game mechanics are a bit cumbersome, but not bad.  I like buttons for arming weapons rather than trying to find that magic spot on imaginary tool belts. It's just more trustworthy, especially when playing seated. 

The sound is excellent. They've really crafted the clarity and 3D positioning of the sounds. Top Notch. I will say, that the NPC companions make an lot of noise that makes you think things are behind you and that is a minor annoyance. I silent mode for the NPC's would be good.

This game is incredible, but the not perfect parts..... if you click the wrong button after a training session, you get sucked back into that. Some things aren't explained well.  I had no idea my sheild needed to be grabbed by reach over my back. 

If you're looking for that premium game to impress yourself and friends...  I really thing this is the one.","Jan 11, 2020 at 10:30 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:56:52.793324,vlad.bagrin,Overhyped,"I only recently got into VR and I was blown away by some of the games like Lone Echo, Superhot VR and Budget Cuts. If they were flat, they'd be mediocre games (I didn't even like the original Superhot), but they're completely transformed when played in VR, because the actions there felt natural, organic, everything is interactive.

Asgard's Wrath, on the other hand, veers more towards standard game interactions. You don't have to pick items from the ground, just hover your hand towards them and grip. To interact with levers you just hover your hand, grip and make a vague gesture. Throwing axes just doesn't make sense to me, I can barely target what I want, and I tried assists on and off, it just never feels real. Combat feels ridiculous, as I wave my sword like an idiot and just wait to parry, which doesn't even always register.

It has high production values and it's much longer than a typical VR game. That's probably why it's so beloved by everyone. If it weren't VR it would have felt like poor man's God of War.","Dec 16, 2019 at 6:14 AM",3, 3,

The characters were fun and interesting, and the various weapons you could use were really cool. Being able to fight as a giant god is super cool and fun. The next part of my review is based on the ending so spoiler warning:
==--==--==--==--==--  ENDING SPOILERS AHEAD!! --==--==--==--==--==

The ending to the game was surprising, to say the least. It was completely obvious that Loki was the bad guy from the beginning, but that the Tavern was an illusion & a prison for Loki I definitely didn't expect. After I fought Loki and was trapped there, I was surprised & dissapointed. The fight with him was a little bland and I was expecting a second phase or a special cutscene but no, the game just ends and you are left with an Ankh on the bar. Speaking of the Ankh, it's from Egyptian mythology, so I can only assume that there will be DLC or a second game with Egyptian gods, and all I can say to that is YES PLEASE! Devs, if you're reading this review, please make some sort of second game/DLC that would be amazing.

There is no fix for it. A lot of people are having the same issue. DO NOT BUY, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY IT PROPERLY.

CPU: R5 2600 OC'd at 4.0 GHZ, Radeon Vega 64 (undervolted and optimized), 16 GB RAM, M2 SSD.
Very poor performance while my GPU stays at 60% usage, cpu under 20% usage (!!!). Updated drivers, clean system, tried various tweaks and fixes, nothing helps.

UPDATE: The above applies to Radeon GPUs only. With a new GTX 2080 installed, oculus updated to 13.0, ASW off, performance is better, now playable at 80 FPS on high settings, still with short frame drops that are independent of quality settings when loading new assets (entering new area, enemies spawning, turning around quickly). Leaving the initial review as a warning for Radeon users.","Jan 13, 2020 at 2:15 AM",4, 0,

I enjoy the characters and locations the controls are responsive and  after updating to the latest nvidia drivers from nvidia the stuttering is mostly gone. Its got intriguing puzzles that require some creativity to solve. 

The bad  The parry mechanic is just so out of place and  requiring you to be pixel perfect or you miss the enemies will start with an overhand and then do a low slash the movements are hard to predict and even when you do put you blades in the appropriate place  you still get dead. This is a piss poor gimmick that dosen't belong in any game let alone this one. Do you like frustration and agitation then this game may be for you. Its like the develope has never attempted to even weild a sword let alon parry with one. It requires god like reflexes and precision to do it right and im playing on mortal.

2022-05-28 17:57:12.032865,BOLL,"It looks amazing, but...","Due to how many praised this game I made it my mission to finished it, and I did, took around 30 hours I believe. While many claim it's the perfect VR game, my impression is a bit different. You can read about all the good points in other reviews so I'll go on a nit-picking rampage.

1. Almost none of the world reacts physically to you, swords go straight through rocks and walls, you can push your head through anything, using room-scale to walk through walls.
2. Many puzzle actions are abstracted to your companions, you don't get to do them, they do, so it becomes like a point and click puzzle game.
3. It was noticeable that animations that could have been canned physics simulations, like when the draw bridge falls, were hand animated and looked very fake in VR.
4. The whole upgrade system is all about crafting, this meant you almost never got any interesting loot or drops, it was just always crafting reagents to be used in the home base. This made rewards uninteresting in general.
5. As mostly anything that drops can be used for crafting or side quests, I ended up picking up absolutely everything I could. It didn't take long until I just wished I had auto-pickup. This also meant inventory juggling every time I was back in the base.
6. Walking is dreadfully slow, it made exploring time consuming and tedious. Not sure if this was to make it comfortable, but for me it was an immediate turn-off.

All in all it felt like I was playing a traditional ARPG that had been ported instead of an actual VR native title, which surprised me. Due to the game being so high profile I did clear it, but I felt done with it after 2/3rds, the last 10 hours were a slog.

BUT
How good is all of that when the game makes you feel dizzy and nauseous within 15/20m? It's a pity that they didn't add other ways of moving around such as teleporting, which has never made me feel like this.
I get it that some people will get used to VR and stop being sick. Unfortunately others, like me, won't. We'd love to, but we can't.
In my condition I cannot enjoy this beautiful game and therefore I have to rate it lower than 5 stars. The developers need to start caring more about this, because it's not just ""comfort"" we are talking about: it's more about health and safety.
A game that makes you feel nauseous isn't just uncomfortable: it's bad for your health, and completely unplayable. Locomotion matters heaps!

If you are used to sliding locomotion and don't suffer of motion sickness at all, you'll love this game.
If you DO suffer of VR sickness and feel nauseous with the sliding locomotion, you won't enjoy this game unfortunately.

2022-05-28 17:57:15.312094,BushidoBush,Unique but frustrating,"You know what I am going to whine about. That REALLY obnoxious parry system and the Runic armor. Making your enemies completely invunlerable till you do a little minigame is OBNOXIOUS. It puts the control of the entire combat in the AIs control. In addition, motion controls still need more percision. I am watching the enemies sword phase through my sword while trying to meet their swing. Now I have red flashes from the enemy and I can't do anything about those so I am assuming its an unblockable attack. Would have appreciated a TUTORIAL about that since they force every other tutorial down my throat in PAINFUL detail.  I realise I have this button on my controller that teleports me a very short distance away, again not tutorialized for me, which I assume I am supposed to use to get out of the way of those attacks but it has a cool down and they will SPAM those attacks one after another. What am I supposed to do then? Run around my room? I have enough room to move around and swing about but I dont have enough room to be running around the place so what am I actually supposed to do? 

Critical, why do I move around the map with the speed of a slug? I get that you are worried about motion sickness but I am immune to that non-sense. Level traversal is a MASSIVE pain when it really doesn't need to be. I thought I was on a quest of vengence, not a casual stroll on the beach?

I think the main reason this game receives such praise is because it is unique. I appreciate them going for challenge instead of babies first sword adventure like a lot of these other VR games are like. However, I dont think the technology is there yet (or the programmers didnt playtest) and ruins this experience.","Nov 17, 2019 at 2:40 AM",1, 6,

2022-05-28 17:57:18.445713,Blampfno,A cool game that shouldnt be a VR game,"Wanted to put this first since it is mentioned quite a bit. I didn't experience any noticably long level load times like some are claiming, and I don't really have a powerful rig (maybe low mid-spec) or SSD. The installation, however, took five and a half hours.  That's not an exaggeration or misspelling. I DO have smoking fast internet, it just takes forever, and it apparently occurs in batches so it looks like it is failing and repeating. It's not. I recommend starting the download before bed, get it rolling, and then leave it alone until morning, or night, or whenever it is you've awakened after getting a clinically responsible amount of sleep. 

On to the game...

Maybe I'm not seeing it? There is a lot this game does extraordinarily well. Putting the VR controls to genuine use beyond pointing and clicking or wire-whisking your enemies with a massless sword is not one of them. I was blown away by the visuals, the story arc seems solid, and Aegir's Hall was straight magic, but the controls and gameplay seem wooden and shallow given how many more involved and immersive VR titles are out there right now. Don't get me wrong, though, this game is well done, polished, and professional. The VR implementation is just kind of... pointless and definitely hyper-simplified, and for me, that was the whole point of the purchase. I probably won't finish it.  There are too many more engaging titles out there than this, and at far lower price points.

Update: Uninstalled to recover disc space. Just couldn't get into it. Just using VR for 3D and point and clicking made it feel like a kid's game.","Dec 22, 2019 at 2:51 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 17:57:18.491590,BrightSummer,Asgard's Broken Mess,"Important to note, the experience I will explain here is on what I think most would consider as a high end machine (GTX 1070, i7 7700k @4.9Ghz, 16GB RAM at 3000Mhz, 256GB Samsung SSD that is used as the game's storage).

Now starting off, I can't say anything else good about the game, as it's nearly impossible to experience the game. The first noticable issue is the loading, which takes anywhere from 6 minutes to 20 minutes - never more, but more importantly, never less. Finally loading in, I notice the graphics are just ""muddy"" (as the best way I can describe it). Even on high settings, nothing looks spectacular and certainly doesn't meet the expectations from all other reviewers considering the game ""a gorgeous graphical feat"". Staring at anything at a low to medium (few meters) distance makes the subject completely unrecognizable. Now given these judgements were based on High settings, I  ended up never actually playing on high settings as the game would also very often hitch, stutter, and just generally run poorly in most areas; so playing on low was the only fix. Though ""fix"" should be taken lightly as most often it would still hardly ever reach the 90 frames per second goal, and instead consistently stick to around 20 to 30 in larger areas. (Again, I've mentioned my PC specifications above - My system far exceeds hardware requirements).

Luckily, Oculus reviews have character limits, so without explaining each gripe with the game, I'll list the remaining biggest issues that make the game unplayable here:

- Combat is, simply put, sloppy. Blocks and attacks also don't register or register at the right time for the enemy, so you are killed and sent back to up to 20 minutes of loading.
- Crashes are frequent, at least once through every session of mine.
- Intended visual effects result in sickening, confusing, and simply hard to look at visuals.

- Lastly, I can't get my refund since I spent more than 2 hours trying to troubleshoot and play this game at all.","Nov 2, 2019 at 12:49 AM",1, 16,

2022-05-28 17:57:28.098895,krillme,Literally bored me to tears.,"This game doesn't innovate in anyway whatsoever. It's one of the most basic and boring action RPGs I've ever played in my life. The combat is on par with Skyrim VR's which is TERRIBLE, and that's a port! How do you make an action RPG built from the ground up exclusively for VR and have combat this boring? This game feels like a Rift launch title. The years of progress made since then seemed to have been completely ignored during the development of this title.

Most reviews here are from newcomers to VR - they don't know there's far better experiences available. If this is your first VR game, you'll probably love it! But if it isn't, this game will bore you to tears.

Blade and Sorcery is a much more exciting, fun, and satisfying experience. What it lacks in visuals or story it makes up for with actual gameplay. Asgard's Wrath is all flash, no substance.","Feb 24, 2020 at 2:04 PM",1, 5,

I thought that in terms of length of play and graphics Lone Echo and Arizona Sunshine were going to be difficult to beat,  however, this game tops both of them.  It costs more than a lot of games but that’s because you get so much game!  The graphics are stunning and the music sets a great atmosphere, feels at times like your in an epic movie. You get to play as a human or as a god. Switching between both is great fun. Plenty of content, weapons, puzzles etc. So far I have played 70 hours and just finished it. I am going to restart missions and do all the side missions / quests now....  This is how VR games should be. I would rather pay a high price for a full length game like this than £7 for a game that’s over in an hour.

When i buy a game the time i need to complete HAS to match the price, and welp this surely do match the price on the lenght!

Graphics:
another important factor for a triple A, and the game doesn't disappiont you here either, it's easily one of the most impressive looking games I've played so far!

Gameplay:
I dont really have anything negative here either, the way you move in the game is pretty intuitive, although if your prone to movement sickness you probably shouldn't buy it, since you move ALOT! 
though i guess on easy you can just wiggle your sword if your somekinda scrub? cant say since noob mode kinda ruins games for me and have in the last couple of years really not been impressed with games, with developers mindset on making the games so easy it's laughable, BUT if you have the same opinion on that as me you wont be disappionted with this game either! 

Lore:
the norse lore is a bit iffy, and kind of mixed together with some other mythologies, but it's not anything game wrecking, and if your not somekinda mythology nerd like me, they have gotten quite close on alot of things, and the game lore is quite enjoyable , and well put together!

Final judgement:
This game will be one of those games that are gonna be remembered for VR, like DOOM is for pc (by having taken gems in the rough, polished the ____ out of them, and incorporated them into their own masterpiece!), and are gonna set a new bar for vr games!
Soooo if your in any kinda doubt (and dont have somekinda potato computer), you should really give this a go, cause if your any kind of rpg gamer, then i will guaranty your gonna enjoy this game!","Nov 30, 2019 at 8:03 PM",5, 8,

But then it happened... After I reached the enemies where you have to parry to destroy the armor I died. Again and again. I got a little bit frustrated.

...until I learned how to ""fight the system"" so I could fight the enemy. Here's why I got problems:

-I repositioned myself the whole time and got too close to the enemy. If this happens, you'll get kicked back, which is frustrating, if it happens all the time.
JUST STAND STILL if your enemy is approaching you in close combat. (unless he uses his red glowing attack, of course)

-My animal companion attacked the shielded enemy (which does no damage this early in the game) and interrupted its attack animations. This made it more difficult to parry the attacks.
COMMAND YOUR COMPANION TO STAND IN A CORNER if you're fighting a single shielded enemy.

-I fought back. Yes, that's a problem. And yes, I knew you can't damage shielded enemies (at least on the higher difficulty settings). I just thought it's stupid if I just stand there and parry/block until the enemy does his blue attack. But hitting the enemy in between its attacks made it difficult for me to react fast enough to parry the blue attack. So...
JUST STAND THERE AND BLOCK/PARRY UNTIL THE ENEMY UNLEASHES ITS STRONG BLUE ATTACK to remove its shield. And only THEN start to fight.

Now I still am not perfect, but atleast the combat is now fun and engaging and not frustrating anymore.
(I reached an arena where you can fight infinite (?) waves of enemies and with this tactics I got to the boss with little to no problems or frustration. AND IT WAS EPIC.)

Man, initially I just waited for Stormlands and thought this is an okay looking game, but now I can't get enough of it.","Oct 15, 2019 at 8:16 PM",5, 15,

WARNING ! The first couple hours are slow. I almost returned it because it seemed shallow at FIRST..... KEEP PLAYING. As the game progresses, so do you ! You gain new weapons, abilities, etc.. Enemies get more challenging too. At just over 5 hours, I LOVE this game. For those complaining about physics based combat : there is a place in the gaming world for both. Physics based combat doesn't always work correctly either - and in a fantasy RPG, I think it's better this way. Why would it be fun to just one 'stab' kill every enemy. There would be no reason to make your weapons more powerful if they all kill with one stab or whatever.

I'm going to be the honest one and tell you its not better than either. Skyrim offers by far the longest and very immersive RPG game play when you mod it and while this offers some elements its not really close if I'm being honest. Lone echo offers THE most immersive gameplay of ANY VR game to date and this while being very immersive and a good story isn't to the same level, it's close though. But there are positives to the game.  It is fun although its three difficultly levels need to be reworked as they are each rather close with very little difference.       
The dynamics and puzzles in the game are fun and the graphics are rather nice and add to the enjoyment. 
If you are on the fence in your choice wait for a sale. Get this at 50% off and it will be worth it.      
Hopefully by then all of the bugs will be worked out. There are numerous folks, myself included, that have issues with stutter during the game and also the game does end up crashing at times even with a beefy gaming pc like mine.   
The ending is a bit anti climatic to be perfectly honest. I won't give it away but lets just say you'll probably be asking what at the end.
I do think DLC or a second part would be a good choice, maybe explore the Greek mythos as the Viking mythos is way over done.","Nov 10, 2019 at 8:53 AM",2, 23,

The load screens can be a bit much, but everything looks and plays so well after them, and there aren't too many, that I didn't think it was worth docking a star, especially since I am on a Laptop with a 1060 not the recomended 1080. 

The movement controls work very well for me on the medium settings while my sister uses the full immersion. I was able to play Skyrim VR but it did give me a bit of motion sickness pretty much from the getgo. That was not the case with Asgards wrath, however I did start to get a bit of tightness around my eyes after about an hour or so of play so I did need to set it down for a bit. I can play beat saber for hours on end no problem, but free moving games like this or Az Sunshine can somtimes trigger motion sickness like symptoms for me. By and large though I did not have any major motion sickness issues and look forward to many more hours of play. 

I really can't over emphasize how amazing everything looked, particularly the character models in the tavern.  There were definitely areas where I could tell they were using very flat textures, practically painted on, but again given the hardware I brought to the table, the smoothness of the experience, and the broad visual fidelity I remain blown away. 

Gameplay wise I like the parrying system, absolutely love being able to go back and forth between ""God mode"" and ""mortal mode"". The puzzles are fun and I am really looking forward to getting into the crafting system.

So listen the game is great when you can play it. and if you dont mind standing in your house staring at nothing waiting to try the lame battle mechanics again because of the unblockable attacks and dumb lack of hit boxes when I LEGIT THROUGH AN AXE THROUGH THAT GUYS LEG AND HE IS UN DAMAGED cause its a parry system???? Bother. not for 40 bucks. not when the game decided to waste 2 hours of my time because I pulled up the giant draw bridge pulley system too early or wrong and spend 2 hours loading back and forth trying to figure out what I didnt do...... nope had to close the game and reload it.

oh and oculus policy is two hours of game play......... THAT INCLUDES LOADING

so I will forgo oculuc exclusives and buy my games of a different platform from now on. You can shove fbook up your port hole with your terrible customer service.  Im gonna go sit at the DMV to recreate the FUN i had playing this game.... wait for me........","Oct 18, 2019 at 7:11 AM",1, 11,

I think the game is compareable with darksiders, or soulreaver. you can always return to the older maps, and open new ways and secrets with your new abilities and companions. There are some different kinds of upgrades (Yggdrasil saplings, upgradeable hero gear, upgradeable companions, etc.).

There's a lot more to like here too - a configurable inventory system which lets you place weapons in various locations on your body so you can grab your shield by reaching over your shoulder or draw your sword from your waist, without having to wade through menus as in Skyrim.

Switching between god and human forms also mixes things up nicely (from your divine perspective humans appear to be an inch or so high and the environment now seems like a cool diorama spread before you).

Having said that there are a few flaws. Firstly the menu option to disable head based locomotion seems to be broken which is really frustrating as it results in your avatar staggering drunkenly from side to side if you look around whilst walking. Please fix this devs - ""controller relative"" locomotion should be a standard feature by now in any VR game so it's disappointing not to have this working at launch. An option to move a bit faster would also be welcome, as would the ability to climb more (currently when you grab a chain or ladder you teleport to the bottom).

The combat is also a bit too event based for my taste. Many of the enemies are totally invulnerable until you parry their special move after which you get a brief window during which you can actually damage them. You can't just spot an opening and strike, and it really doesn't help immersion when you see your sword clearly slice through an enemy's neck but have no effect whatsoever.

Finally, the HUD can be a bit intrusive at times with prompts like ""Press A to talk to someone"" 3 or 4 times larger than they need to be. 

Anyway, hopefully some of these issues will be addressed in patches, but even in its current form this is an essential purchase for any VR gamer!","Oct 11, 2019 at 12:31 PM",5, 11,"We appreciate the great review.

2022-05-28 17:58:03.252872,Psychobabbler95,The New Bar Has Been Set,"Asgard's Wrath is what a quality VR game looks like. I've played other really good RPGs in VR. Skyrim, Fallout 4, Vanashing Realms, etc... None can compare to Asgard's Wrath (AW). 

AW has it all and it's all done SO well. Firstly, the graphics are incredible. My rig isn't the latest and greatest, but it gets the job done. I run AW on the lowest graphical setting. It looks amazing. Environments are so rich in detail, I find myself exploring every corner just to admire the scenery.  The characters and enemies you encounter are fantastic and varied. 

Secondly, the gameplay. Combat is smooth and incredibly fun. The mechanics feel natural. You parry, block, slash, stab, shield bash, anything you can do in a pancacke (flat screen) RPG, you can do here, but naturally. This isn't a flick your wrist until it's dead kind of combat. You actually have to develop some combat skills.

Combat is only a part of this game. There are puzzles galore! If you've played the Darksiders or Legend of Zelda series, you'll have an idea of the flow of this game. You'll find yourself gladly going back to areas you've already visited, to find access to new areas with the new powers you've gained. There are things hidden everywhere! You'll need to search in god and mortal form to find things. There is a ton of loot. Your enemies will drop their weapons when you defeat them. It's not like those games where you fight an enemy with a flaming blade and it disappears after the battle. 

Thirdly, the story. It's EPIC! The story is based in Norse mythology and is dripping in lore. I'm not going to go into detail here. You need to experience it yourself. Just know that you'll be visiting many environments that will keep you busy for at least 35+ hours. My suggestion is to take your time.

Impressive work by Sanzaru. They made a real AAA game for the VR.
Finally we can enjoy a full RPG adventure in viking mithology and in VR.

The game itself is the mixture of different gameplay styles: there is a bit of skyrim, god of war 4 and many others but, this time, with the full native support of VR, thus making this game really unique.

Sanzaru made a wonderful job with the melee and ranged combat system.
You cannot anymore kill an enemy just waving around your weapon aimlessly.
You need to parry, block and attack at the right time and you also need to master those mechanics, otherwise you'll die badly.

The follower system is very good.
Those animals are not only your companions, they are also your pets, so you need to make a bond with them, show your appreciation and take care of them.
The more they are happy the better!
Sometimes they'll find objects for you, more powerful if the pets are happy and strong! So keep them happy and make them stronger!

The control system is almost intuitive, although it could be problematic for the left handed (I'm ambidextrous).
There are plenty of options for motion and rotation (but no teleportation).
I like full freedom in VR, so I'm using full motion and full rotation with no motion sicness at all.

There are 4 level of graphic details: low, medium, high, epic.
Of course, the epic setting level requires a very high end pc, but I'm enjoying the game even at medium with some compromises (some world details are missing to lower GPU requirements and CPU draw calls).

I'm playing with an i5 3570K@4.4GHz - GTX 1060 6GB - riftS - 32GB - HDD on MEDIUM with NO STUTTERS and almost no microstutters.
Loading time of about 13-18 sec between fast travel.
You can lower the loading time down to 9 sec with SSD but only if your PC has a good motherboard.

And this is a FULL game. Like 40+ hours potentially. They did a great job of allowing people new to VR play it in a comfortable and easy way...

I did have issues with load time. It was taking 1.5 minutes everytime I went somewhere or when I died. It's a little frustrating that it unloads all the assets on death. Why not just keep the textures and models in memory and just reinitialize the objects?

So 1.5 minutes was way too long to wait. I made some room on my Evo 970 Pro NVMe drive. Load times dropped to 20 seconds, a sagnificant result. I've done this with other games such as GTA V and did not get anything close to that result. If you have enough solid state storage to spare, it seems to really boost load times.

There was one particular section where fire traps insta-kill you. I kept getting killed even though it seemed like the fire was not touching me. This was especially furstrating since every time I died, I had to wait 1.5 minutes (before I moved to NVMe). I would love to see quicker load times after death. Like I mentioned earlier, it seems a shame that the game does a clean wipe on memory when you die. Keeping the assets around in memory seems like some low hanging fruit in the quality of life department.","Oct 25, 2019 at 1:10 AM",5, 4,

The graphic is gorgeous, even with medium settings, and it runs smoothly even with my old 1060 6GB, and thanks to my SSD the loading time is no more than 10 seconds. The companions system is really great, the combat system of the ""easy mode"" is engaging and fun, the puzzles are cool and not too difficult, the story is good, and there is an incredible amount of content.
JUST BUY THIS GAME!!!

So, why 4 stars instead of 5, you ask? This is freaking why...
The combat system in ""normal"" and ""hard"" mode breaks a lot of the fun. The ""armor"" system used doesn't work so well. Enemies with an armor can't take any damage, and the only way to break the armor is by parrying theyr ""special blue attacks"" with your melee weapon. This cause a lot of problems at the game mechanics: 
1) You are forced to use a melee weapon. You can't have another style of combat, because there is no way to break the armor from the distance with an arrow or an axe, or by magic (except for upgraded weapons that you can craft in the late game).      
2) If there are multiple enemies with an armor, your companion will be useless because he can't break it. The only way to make him do it, is to use a Frenzy potion to activate his special attack. Otherwise he will die miserably because the enemy can kill him but he can't kill the enemy.    
3) If there is just a single armored enemy, your companion presence is more than useless. Is annoying. His attacks will break most of the animations of the enemy, included the ""special blue attack"", making impossible to break the armor.

Just an idea for Asgard's Wrath 2 (if it will ever come out one day) : breakable armor pieces on the body of the enemy. You just have to hit that specific body part to break the armor. This way you can choose how to do it (with a sword, with an arrow, with magic). This way you can also choose the right companion based on his style of combat that could have different ways to target specific body parts.","Nov 1, 2019 at 10:19 AM",4, 3,

I have only played a few hours but i'm already hooked, i'm not usually an rpg fan but in vr it's a different story. This game does take up a lot of storage and you have to increase you vitual memory for it to run smooth(loads of info on the net about how to do this) but it does run very well. I did get a bit of a sick feeling when i first played but after a couple of sessions it has stopped. the position of your body in this game is spot on and when you get into battle you really feel like your fighting, you really do feel like you have been taken to a different land. Even if your not into this type of game i suggest that you get it, this is the future of vr and it shows what can be done. This game is a bargin at £30 and with the side quests and main game it will last ages, i can see myself re playing this game if i ever complete it.

Bought this on day of release and HOLY COW! (omg oculus censored pff) 
after an complete evening (6hrs!!) wasted and a few the day after of trying to install this 130GB!! (awesome!!) game through some broken oculus home app. i finally managed it to put it on my SSD drive. (moved from regular HDD, since 139GB seemed not enough to install)

BOY WHAT A JOY!
throw all your made in a basement garbage games in the bin and install this.

This is an really well put together RPG with a ton of content. 40 bucks is a steal if you compare this to all Garbage what is on VR today (few exceptions)

Best thing is i run this on my 3570k @4,3Ghz with an RX580 8Gb and this runs great and looks great as well! (might be medium settings, dunno

2022-05-28 17:58:19.330867,Theforeseen,I would love to give this 5 stars but...,"So I will start with the negatives as everyone seems to start with the positives

Maybe I have been spoiled by  Blade&Sorcery when it comes to Melee combat because the combat in this is slow and painful it basically comes down to block , block , block , dodge the unblockable attack then parry their super and then get a few hits until their magic armour is gone then repeat till dead , it is very stale and boring so I mostly just sit there dodging as my companion slaughters everything because if I try to not play the slow parry game and instead try to parry then attack before their super attack then you get stun locked automatically by headbuts and kicks you cant block.

The loading times are mind numbingly long even with no background apps running and on a HDD with basically nothing else but other VR games on it.

I made it to the first boss fight with TYR before calling it quits I truly did try to get into this game as it has so much love put into it. Now the boss fight with TYR is basically a timed shooting mini game where you shoot these chained balls before they hit you then hit the blue ball to take off some armour its fairly boring , the best bit is when you get into a fist fight with him but then he goes back to throwing balls. Now the problem here is that after 3 or so shots of my god bow the bow despawns and then I have to regrab it , the problem is that its usually 3-4 shots you need to hit before the blue shot that removes his armour so I basically let the first two shots hit me everytime then shoot the rest and then re grab the bow and hope to god I hit his armour before he gets back up or I lost my chance.

Now on to the god , the textures are great as are the voice acting and enviroment , the puzzles are abit too constant and really break the flow how ever with the combat as boring as it is you're stuck between boring and bland puzzles and boring and bland combat.

How ever the immersion is great and so is the story and Loki is looking hot.","Oct 16, 2019 at 9:47 PM",3, 6,

Ridiculous that some people are taking away stars from reviews because of their own mistakes. Lots of people complaining about how you teleport up ladders which isn't realistic.

2022-05-28 17:58:25.689859,Sigmadelta8,Incredibly fun but burdened by issues,"To preface, I'd like to say I have a gtx 1080, a ryzen 5 1600, and 16GB of ram. The game is stored on a HDD. 

This game is super super fun... when it works. As listed above, I have a pretty darn beefy system, and yet (on medium settings even), when enemies spawn in or anything remotely graphically intense happens I get major stuttering and many parts around me are just black with the loading hourglass in the bottom right hand corner. This alone makes things really annoying. But aside from that, if the game is not on an SSD, the load times are a little riciulous. I end up waiting a solid 2 minutes and thirty seconds every time I die or want to go anywhere, which is not fun. Granted, this would probably be solved if the game was stored on an SSD. Additionally, combat can be super fun! ....if you dont get stuttering and random parts of your fov not loading in. The parrying system is a little strange - it feels really good when it happens the way it's supposed to, but this seems rare. Often times I'll go to block a swing with the sword in my right hand, but their sword will bounce off the sword in my left hand that didn't do anything. It's pretty glitchy at best, and it lead to a lot of my deaths where I was pretty darn sure that I parried it but their swing went through anyway. Maybe I'm bad, but it definitely didn't feel the way it was supposed to. 
Side note, and this may be a part of the game, but I was unable to heal many times when entering my inventory. I would hold the potion up to my face repeatedly and nothing would happen. Maybe there is a status effect that prevents this, but I don't believe I was told about it. 
Over all, as the title says, the game (when it works) is incredible. My problem is that for my PC, apparently, it doesn't work just enough to ruin the experience.","Nov 18, 2019 at 6:38 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:58:25.715790,MadMatz,What an epic adventure!,"20hrs in at this point and still amazed. Story, characters, level design, combat, crafting is all very well done. The fights are challenging even on the medium difficulty.  This is how a (VR) game should be. Only criticism i have is, that puzzles are sometimes too easy and the combat could have been more physics based (just nitpicking though). Even though i may be halfway through the game, i already wish this journey will never end. It definetly has replay value due to constant new companions who will give you access to areas you previously weren't able to go. Nonetheless i hope there will be a successor or maybe some dlc in the future.  If you're looking for a full fledged VR game that will keep you playing for hours and hours with pure joy, look no further Asgard is the right place to be in 2019.","Oct 15, 2019 at 5:24 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:58:25.741720,AlexClockwork,"It's good, if you have a SSD","So, the game is good. Nothing mindblowing, but a good and varied adventure game that's kind of linear with tons of secrets and sidequests.

However, I barely play it because each time I open it I spend almost as much time waiting as I do playing. And okay, I get it, I should have a SSD by now, will probably get one within a month. But, if you have a HDD, the loading times are a serious problem.

It's not only that each loading screen is close to 2 minutes, and that it's VR, so you can't wait while browsing your phone. It's that, until you increase your inventory through sidequests, you have to load a whole area to empty it, which doesn't even make sense in the first place. You can always just go to said area and dump your items, or go and grab what you need, so the 4 minute load (two to go to the area and two to go back) doesn't add anything at all to the game.

So it's 2 minutes of loading when you open the game, plus 2 when you change an area, plus 2 every time you die, plus 4 if your inventory gets full... And so there's a lot of just standing in your VR area looking at a loading screen. And I wouldn't really mind... If it wasn't because the 4 terrible minutes you need to empty your inventory are so incredibly pointless. It's just poor design. Reminds me of Fable 3.

Okay, so, there's my rant about loading screens. Other than that, it's a nice game. It's long, varied, and it looks good. So, if you have a SSD or don't mind the loading screens, it's probably a nice grab.","Nov 13, 2019 at 4:50 AM",4, 4,

Sounds cool until the tracking breaks so badly you can't aim because your hands are sliding into the distance and getting stuck without any kind of tracking with a bow in hand while you're helplessly barraged by explosions. This isn't a hardware issue because it ONLY happens when holding that specific bow in that specific fight (though I couldn't get any farther than that fight because, oh right, the game doesn't work) and tracking (generally) functions just fine in any other circumstance.

I submitted a refund request, but because they have a policy of ""2 hours of less playtime"" I couldn't refund because it takes more than 2 hours to arrive at the boss. I am left with a completely unresponsive trashbag of a game that I can't even play because of nothing that has to do with me.

2022-05-28 17:58:38.603320,LOTUK,"Good game, killed by load times","This game is impressive and great looking. But the load times feel like they're a third of the game (each followed by about 10 seconds of black screen). They are abnoxiously long and in one part, I had to sit through the huge load time to get back to the inn, craft an item, sit through a big load time again to get back to where I was to use the item, then sit through a big load time AGAIN to load the next area which the item gave access to for the next part of the story.

My otheer game breaking complaint is the enemy shield bash or kick. With the harder enemies always advancing and kicking/bashing you back when close, it means you must always step back to give ground, or move around. This doesn't work well in a tethered VR space. It means I keep backing in to my VR boundry and having to try and run around the bad guy. But snap turning and cables and not knowing if I'm in a safe place to fight in the physical word, often has me facing another wall. And I don't feel like the fighting in the game should include fighting with a VR play space (3x3 for me). This could be solved by the enemies moving back after a bash so you still get the challenging combat without being backed in to a physical wall.

I have really enjoyed the game though. But the two issues above may stop me from playing it or recommending it to anyone.

It is full of details in the environment, the textures, and the NPC's. It has a meaty quest system and storyline. There's so many maps and areas within the maps to explore. The gameplay is fun, there's a lot of variety in weapon types and ways to tackle fights. The companion system adds more depth to the game by giving you a reason to use them outside of battles. The menu system just makes sense for VR. It's very responsive, which I've noticed in a lot of VR games is not the case. The graphics are beautiful for a VR game of this scale. This is THE VR game to buy. If you are on the fence, take the plunge you will not regret it. 9/10 Best VR game ever.

Parries only want to work like 1 out of every 100 times and only seems to get worse. I would rather fight larger groups of enimies with differnt weaknesses and openings than wait 8 seconds for some of these guys to swing and pray to the Gods that the parry will actually parry and make them mad. I have wasted my entire inventory on some of these guys. I have spent 2 days on this and I dunno if I'll play much further if its all just parry pray, and light puzzle solve. I want to enjoy this game but wtf. blocking hardly works, the knock you back 20 feet and stab you from 10 feet. you should be able to parry from inside the weapon to all the way to the shoulder. I still cannot figure out the right spot after 3 days and it hardly works at all. I have tought martial arts and this parry and pray is not cool at all. This is not RPG combat either. Don't like it at all. I get technical, statigical, mechanical, but this just feels like bs to extend the game. Make it fun yo.","Oct 18, 2019 at 10:36 PM",1, 4,

And O boy do they play with scale brilliantly in this game. I downloaded this yesterday after i preorderd it some time ago.. My plan was to just try it out and play the intro as i had seen a few of the videos. But this game really gripped me and i wound up playing a few hours and sleeping less (This is something i used to do some time back with games very few games get me to do this now as i try to maintain a good lifestyle) ..But wow this game is brilliant its made for VR from ground up . so it isn't as massive as skyrim but they make it feel more massive with the mechanics and scale of things...The only critique i would have is that the voice acting could be done a bit better but i guess being over dramatic was the norm at that era lol.. Must buy for sure.. I am excited to see what future brings to VR after this one....Also i played on a RIFT S with a 1080 gtx at max and i have to say i didnt see any pixels or screen door effect..What kind of magic is this !..

2022-05-28 17:58:48.211621,Scoots4722,The VR Game We've Been Waiting For,"The title says it all. This is easily the best VR game I've played yet, and by a large margin. It is a fully fleshed out experience that involves an immersive story, challenging combat, and beautifully designed environments.

While not an open world game, there are side areas to discover and explore with meaningful side quests to pursue. One early side quest could be easily passed up, but actually adds depth to the main campaign.

The gameplay is where this game shines though. I've not yet played a full game that feels designed from the ground up for VR. You have to parry, block and dodge your enemie's attacks.. It's not enough to stand there and trade blows. Standing toe to toe with the first enemy that towered over me was perhaps one of my favorite video gaming moments ever. I had no idea how I was going to win the fight, and it was truly rewarding when I came out on top.

At a price point of $40, this game is an absolute bargain. I have played and struggled through the hardest setting for several hours and have just completed the first leg of the game. I'm very much looking forward to going back to complete the challenges I haven't and playing through the remaining campaign.","Oct 23, 2019 at 11:00 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 17:58:51.446969,goesBang,Best Game so far,"I have purchased a lot of games - many of them highly prised in the recommendations. So far I have not been very impressed, lots of concept studies, minigames, demos etc. - often totally overpriced im comparision to a full tripple A game, where you can play weeks and weeks.

But this game here is really a marvel - just finished the bar mini quests - this details, this side stories, the god fights, the god mode, the crafting etc. etc. Every day I'm playing this I'm impressed again.

Together with Beat Saber this are my most played games - I can play every day or 2 days and I'm never done.


One problem are sometimes the graphics. I have a GTX 980 with 4 GB and often the textures cannot be loaded and then there are just ugly surfaces. On the other hand I have no micro stuttering like others.

My family would also really like to play this game, but the missing german localization is a problem. I would guess, that the game loses a lot of potential because of this, not many people  dare to buy a quest heavy english game as foreign speakers.","Oct 22, 2019 at 5:09 AM",5, 9,

The characters are diverse, puzzles and levels are intertwined with the progress you make while keeping the story and narration simple but fulfilling.

You don't just experience being a god, but you also live the adventures of the people you posses making it a very diverse and complete experience.

I have been moderately playing this game since release, (3 weeks ago now), Not every day, but still a solid amount of hours went in it so far... And I am not through the full story yet.

Stop hesitating, it's definitely worth every penny.","Oct 30, 2019 at 5:25 PM",5, 5,

But the one aspect that breaks this game for me is the combat. Being in VR, I expect to be able to be physically present. My real life movements should be used for virtual life movements. Not so in this game when it comes to combat. There are certain “unblockable” attacks from npcs. In order to deal with those attacks you don’t just dodge with your body or block with your weapon, you stupidly have to use your controller joystick and a button press to dodge. If this was a pancake game, sure that make sense. But in VR?  Really bad design choice. Takes my out of the enjoyment of the game. This game could have come out as a pancake only game as is. Maybe that was the developers purpose. But for VR?  Not the way to go.","Oct 23, 2019 at 7:59 PM",1, 9,

There is CONSTANT stuttering, and this is reported by at least 20 other people on reddit. It seems it happens when trying to stream a shader for the first time in a scene. Once down, the gameplay goes back to being smooth again.
HOWEVER, this happens all the time in combat, whilst walking about and makes the experience really awful - which is a shame, because the game underneath is very fun, graphically stunning.

Needed to start with that because I am so tired of reading people rate this game 1-2 stars due to long loading screens...its not the developers fault, not the games fault, its YOU, the purchasers' fault for not taking the necessary precautions when buying and installing a 165gb VR game!

Zelda, Moss and God of War in particular. I'm left handed and the bow works great (I just found out :)) The sword swings and shield bash feeel good. I love the addition of the animal companions (Those celebrations!) and the idea of backtacking once more stuff is unlocked. The loading times are a bit of a drag. Now to the downside (I'm hoping the devs read this) As I've said, I'm left handed and movement is on the left thumbstick. While this is fine during exploration. It's terrible during combat. Trying to swing my weapon and control movement together is really spoiling the game for me. In fact I'm getting a 3d Rudder in the hope of negating it. The problem is I would then have to sit down to play. Which would spoil the immersion. If the devs are reading this. Please add movement to the right thumbstick as well. Or allow button mapping.

2022-05-28 17:59:01.150016,JackDiddley,Step In The Right Direction,"Okay, it took me a while to update my system, and then get the hang of this game.  They did a great job with the game, the visuals are awesome, love the companions, the fighting action is fantastic, boss battles are fun, and the level progression is the best I've seen in VR.  The open world is great, and I love walking around and finding side quests.  

I feel like this game can't be rated the same way other games are rated,  it is hopefully the first in a long line of games giving us the full RPG experience in VR.  There is no other game like it so far, but there were some things that could have been improved.

First the game doesn't explain itself very well.  I have been directed to collect my reward at the world tree a few dozen times, but I don't know what or where it is.  Someone online told me it doesn't become available until later in the game, why direct me to it if it isn't available?  Am I going to receive a bunch of rewards once I get there or are they forfeit because it isn't open yet?  There are other things like that, where it just isn't clear what you are supposed to be doing and the big book at the tavern doesn't help much.  So far Loki has provided relevant information directing me to find stuff, but now all he talks about is the local barfly and I have broken bottles over the heads of everyone in the place and nobody reacts.  Who is this barfly and when are we having this drinking contest?

I love the companions but sometimes I have to dismiss them because they are more of a liability.  They jump between me and the enemies, and I spend more time trying to keep them from getting killed than I do fighting.  Astrid, you have a bow, you don't need to be between me and the bad guys.  If there is a way to direct them to be more cautious in battle I haven't found it.

There is a bunch of little stuff too, like thank you for making a one click process to go from vendor to vendor in the tavern, why didn't you think of that for inventory.  The belt is handy but another issue is I often grab for a potion and end up with one of my weapons in my hand.  Once I press the button to initiate the belt, that hand should be dedicated to the belt.  Also hands, you can switch your dominant hand but it doesn't really change much.  You end up having to move and grab from your belt with your left hand, and if your left handed that is your weapon hand too.  Also something visually entertaining or even a minigame during the extremely ling loading screens would be good, it's not like I can just pick up my cell to distract during those loading screens, the sensory deprivation feels like a mild torture. 

The jump between difficulty levels is enormous, runic armor that can only be broken after parrying is an interesting concept, mixed with unblockable attacks, multiple enemies, and a weird movement mechanic that seems to follow your view instead of your hands even when you turn that off...  it becomes way more difficult.  

Now don't get me wrong, it is still the biggest step forward I've seen in any VR game towards giving us a complete game experience, instead of just one mechanic made into a game.  Even things we've seen in other games is done decidedly better here,   Throwing the axe and pulling it back feels very satisfying, the sword play is really well done too.  More like this please!

I can see myself playing this throughout the winter.","Nov 10, 2019 at 8:21 AM",4, 12,

Being VR I just cant believe it. 122gb I guess I can lol. Seriously this game is a master piece! - The graphics are 100%, game play is crazy good! I cant fault it. If no VR existed and this came to xbox or PC as an RPG, I would love it. I tried playing on medium and got maybe 7 hours in and fk it became so hard to fight. I went to Mortal and its still hard but ok (my arms are sore lol). Its a HUGE fantasy Asguard world. Stunningly beautiful, full RPG, detail is like going to a hollywood studio and looking at the made up characters. Cant believe you can play a normal character but then also traspose into a GOD and look down at everything still in full detail nd also interact - e.g. 1st area your small( wont say) but you can just transform into your godly form and pick up your characters and look in full detail. Look basically, you hav never played a VR game like this. So buy it!!!! its incredible!! Thanks you Oculus, this game will save VR for sure!
No complaints, anyone saying they cant run on a high end PC is lying, I have a amd 2600k and an amd Rx480 8B Card. Game runs 100% perfecfull EPIC GPX and Resolution 90% (can have 100% bu some areas are to bi).
My onl eoan times between wrolds, its no big deal, except when you die and have to wait 1 min on an M1 ssd to replay.
Otherwise 100 out of 100 for the first epic VR game!!!!!

2022-05-28 17:59:20.489291,Treebsquire,So close to perfect,"Overall this is an amazing VR experience so far, however there are two major issues that prevent this from being a 5 out of 5 experience. 

First is the performance. I'm running an 8700k/2080ti set up and even i'm getting frame rate drops all the time, even in the central HUB. The game looks decent but not enough to cause that kind of slow down, given I can run any non VR game in 4K.

Secondly, there are no collision or weapon physics. If a single developer can do this in Blade and Scorcery then there's no excuse for a massive studio/production like this not to. This makes the combat in the game very floaty and lacks weight. I've died so many times from blocks not registering because the enemy weapon just clips through mine. It's very frustrating. It also really takes you out of the experience where your weapons clip through every object in the game. 

Those issues aside,  I'm very grateful for this game even being made. No one has come close to making a VR game on this scale, with this level of detail. I hope this  is the start of things to come for VR!","Oct 11, 2019 at 6:36 PM",4, 11,

Voice acting and storyline are also very well done. So far I’m impressed with many elements of this game. Graphics are also amazing! Did not expect AAA graphics when I downloaded. This is definitely one of the best VR games to date. A few things that were missing for me are better character development and a clearer understanding of how quests fit in with what’s happening in the story. Also, harder puzzles would be good.

There is a green crystal bowl that you are suppose to place on the proper pole when you are in god mode. I happned to have dropped it when I was placing it there and it fell through the map, and is not responding back to it's starting point for me to pick it up and try again. So I am unable to complete the bridge the old man is suppose to cross to continue the game. I've invested too much time and unlocked everything for the shield maiden to start over a whole new game. Going to be asking for a refund since the game company has not gotten back to me or answered their phone. Play at your own risk.
 Aside from this I has had to deal with the game jamming up everytime a fight begins. and with every sword stroke the enemy makes, the game will freeze for a moment. My PC is well over the recomended specs so I blame the game for this.","Dec 2, 2019 at 3:41 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 17:59:26.827338,doyourealize,Massive Potential with Some Poor Design,"I want to start off by saying I love this game. When I pictured VR before I bought my Rift S, this is very close to the game I imagined playing, and now it's here. A game with an interesting combat system, some light puzzles, and beautiful environments.

However, as some have already pointed out, load times are pretty atrocious. Having to travel betweens worlds just to lighten your load is always tedious, and it's made worse when there's 5 minutes between deciding to leave for Asgard, then returning to whatever world you're currently working your way through. When you die, you're also forced to sit through a minutes long load screen just to pick up where you left off.

All this, though, would bring it down to a 4 out of 5 star rating. However, when you couple all that with random encounters, it loses another star. It's okay to clear a room the first time, and can be a great example of a proper challenge. Learn to fight, or die. But on resurrecting, you've learned something about an enemy's timing or a weakness, and can exploit it the next time. Even so, when you're forced into a tough battle in every area, even when you've already been there, the load times become an almost fatal flaw.

I'm still early in the game, so I've far from mastered the combat. Any enemy above the standard draugr is a challenge, and I really feel accomplished when I win a battle! But in a game that encourages exploration, and all but requires backtracking to discover secrets, I shouldn't have to dread travelling back to a puzzle section because I might die in a random encounter and be forced to sit through a too-long load screen. There is an option to lower the difficulty to make parrying optional, but parrying is fun! And I want to get good at it. Random encounters here make me have to decide between getting good, or waiting for longer than I'm playing.

Test me, sure, but in a game that can take literal minutes to load after death, test me in specific situations, not every five steps.","Oct 14, 2019 at 11:17 AM",3, 9,Thank you for the feedback. We are always looking at reviews to see how we can improve things for a patch.

They've really created a great game, and a must have for any RPG fans, especially for those who love the Elder Scroll series. Non-RPG fans might not enjoy it as much, however. It's an excellent looking game, but this also means you'll need a powerful PC to play it. Combat can begin to feel a bit repetitive, though this is something I feel with any typical RPG. The enemies tout a pretty good amount of health and there is a bit of a focus on parrying, blocking, and dodging, so combat can get a bit lengthy for my taste...though its not the worst sinner in this area. There's plenty of junk to pick up, so be prepared to pickup a lot then go back to drop off and craft stuff.

2022-05-28 17:59:39.759749,CarloFromMilkyWay,Finally!!!!!!,"So far my favorite VR game was Fallout 4 (and before Skyrim).  Unfortunately, the fact that the virtual reality market still in a  little niche, makes the porting of successful games not natively developed for VR the only possible way to have AAA titles.  Thanks to Oculus and his ""endless"" funds Sanzaru has managed to perform the miracle: create a title exclusively for VR that has the depth and  the details of the non-VR masterpieces.  All the stylistic choices made by the developers are perfect: the menus and the interfaces, the mechanics of fighting, in this title fantastically credible because complex and satisfying, the duality God / Hero, the epic greatness of the audio department.  But the better thing is the story.  It does not simulate, as other VR games do, a length that does not have, to camouflage with a lot of repetition the little development.  Instead it is a well developed and coherent story.  In short, I am impressed both by the maturity shown by Sanzaru and by the beauty of VR, light years more engaging than other technologies for which it concerns the involvement and unfortunately, I am afraid, so much unknown to make Argard's Wrath possible only with the  funding of a wealthy company like Oculus.

2022-05-28 17:59:42.993100,SockDP,Even Playable on Low End Hardware!,"Didn't see any reviews addressing this, so I thought I would. Obviously the game is amazing, buy it if you haven't already. Beautiful graphics, well optimized, and fantastic addicting gameplay as a mortal warrior and an all powerful God. Transforming into your God form and towering over the world like standing over a miniature train set is probably the most enjoyable gameplay aspect for me. But, the thing that really got me was how I was able to run this game near flawlessly on my Radeon RX480 GPU! Granted I get a couple tracking issues here and there on the rift s and the rare frame drop flicker, but no tracking issues on the original rift, and as long as I set the graphics to low, I maintain stable max frame rates most of the time depending on my HMD (80fps rift s, 90fps rift)! I have a GTX 1080 on the way, but the fact I can still enjoy this game on my entry level VR GPU at all is astounding. I can't even run Sairento as good as this game on my setup! Great game devs, you deserve so much praise for this VR masterpiece, definitely looking forward to your upcoming stuff and the future of AAA, full game, VR titles in general. VR is definitely NOT dead! I had honestly planned to move exclusively to the Valve Index, but if Oculus keeps releasing and supporting original quality content like this, I will gladly continue to keep supporting.","Oct 17, 2019 at 4:20 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:59:43.021026,SDC-Wutang,It's all that and a bag of chips!,"OK.  No chips.  But this is certainly a new benchmark for VR gaming.  So glad we're coming out of the era of, what really amounts to mini games that show off virtual reality.  I think most enthusiasts like myself are ready for more.  This is more!

At $40 the price point is more than reasonable for a AAA title such as this, considering a full blown Xbox game starts around $60.  Someone on Youtube mentioned it took them 25 hours to get through just the main storyline, without all the side missions.  

I was a bit concerned about performance at first since the requirements say GTX 1080.  I'm  only running a 1060 3GB and it runs fine with the graphics set to high.  But graphics on epic is where this game really shines so I went ahead and upgraded to a RTX 2070.  (Hopefully Defector, that hog, will run better as well)

I've been super skeptical about VR RPG Games so far and have held off on purchasing a few that looked shallow but I would recommend this game to absolutely anybody. Can't wait to get some free time to really dig into this and continue the story.

This feels like a complete game with a sense of building your characters, gear, and progression. Combat is actually really challenging too even on the medium difficulty ( at least the elite NPCS you encounter an hour in). The Tutorials are really helpful and the transition from gameplay to tutorial feels natural.","Oct 11, 2019 at 10:16 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 17:59:49.420908,Quasars,This is not Skyrim,"Excellent VR game definitely a must have BUT as i read many people referring to Skyrim.. this isnot, not the depth of story or the NPC's dialogues stories etc, there is only you and the character that hold your hands to tell you what to do and some followers ( companions) and enemies if course.

The game looks amazing thanks to high red textures ( 160 gb) once installed, 
there is a puzzle side a la ""Moss""and some crafting, like lot of iron gives you sheet of iron lot of sheets gives you lingot of iron etc... 
the combat mechanic are difficult you have to  follow the sequence chosen by  the developers or you'll die quickly (  parry, attack, block, repeat) you can throw the sword, i find it weird that i can buy arrows but not the bow ( somebody help?) hope the développer gave us more freedom and diversity in melee combat like assassin's creed. 
i noticed some bugs like texture not loading in some objects like rocks or barrels. 
Hope developers will expend the game later with more depth znd back story of each character and maybe make ig an open world...","Oct 14, 2019 at 12:39 AM",4, 5,

Did not play Lone Echo yet, but that game is certainly the flagship for VR for the year to come at least. Almost as well polished as Robo Recall is, but with more gameplay and content. It looks more accessible than hardcore, but it's a lot of fun anyway. And controls are real good and convincing despite some very minor drawbacks.

Interface for accessing inventory I don't like. I played Skyrim/Fallout 4 for 100+ hours in 2D and getting there in VR too. I suppose I was expecting the same masterpiece level with this. I have difficulty set to Legendary and find the combat so hard and frustrating, which is why I gave up on Chronos and just couldn't play something like Dark Souls. Maybe if I drop to Mortal (easy) I'd enjoy it more but exploration and finding barrels etc. just reappear returning to an area seems weird. Absoultely loved God Of War games on PS3/PS4 for the Norse Mythology so can't understand why this isn't better for me. I'll keep going for a while longer and update my review if it improves playability. Not found any way your character levels up or gains any new abilities as game progresses yet, which is usually a motivator in RPGs for me.","Oct 18, 2019 at 4:39 AM",3, 4,

Almost every single VR game is over and completed in under 10 hours, and even then, only a few games that have enough content for more than a few hours of playtime. I have over 2 hours in Asgards Wrath so far, (And Im loving every minute of it) and I only have 2% total completion. Even if you don't strive to get 100% completion, anyone can easily get at least 40+ hours out of this game in terms of play time. The higher price tag of $40.00 compared to other VR games might make some reconsider, but this game is easily worth it. I would reccomend this game to anyone with a VR headset, because Asgards Wrath is a must have, with its entertaining gameplay, mechanics, and feel.","Oct 15, 2019 at 6:25 AM",5, 2,

Graphics are incredible, Gameplay is perfect, and its a full blown game not just an expeirence you get sick of after 10 minutes like alot of other games. At $40 it is on the expensive side but worth every penny. Unlike Skyrim VR this game was made only for VR and you can tell. If i had to complain about one thing i would have to say im a little dissapointed in the sword mechanics just seems kind of arcade-y to me but made just played too much blade & sorcery.

2022-05-28 17:59:55.845724,AxelMarx,Great,"Performance is smooth for me on my crusty old 980 Ti @ medium GFX settings (though it does make the Oculus deck in the BG lag like hell sometimes if you step back out of the game. Fortunately you can re-calibrate on the fly in-game, so that’s not too annoying). I’ve yet to try bumping up the GFX settings, but I’m not holding my hopes too high if 2080xx cards are struggling!

People marking this down to one star just because of lack of localization, or download issues when the world and his wife were trying to DL it are just churlish beyond reason!

Take some of the glowing reviews with a pinch of salt, and allow for hyperbole. This game is no Skyrim (I’m not talking just the VR Skyrim), but for a VR game it’s probably as close as we’re going to get for a good while, it really is good. Innovative and well thought out. There are a few minor niggles with it, combat feels a little floaty due to the lack of feedback (but no worse than titles like Gorn). Load times between levels are about 10-20 secs at my settings, but I’d expect that to be higher if you crank up the eye candy settings. The game could really do with a grip toggle for holding weapons, esp. if you’re a lefty like me, as it gets old fast having to hold in the side trigger when movement is also on the left controller. Progression / upgrades are a wee bit overly grindy. 

Those points (which keep it from being a 5 star job) aside, it’s an impressive effort. Other than Lone Echo, it’s the first VR game I’ve played that really does feel like a fully fleshed out game. The companions have character, the areas are small but designed well, and most importantly of all… it’s just great fun. I was a little concerned this wouldn’t be worth the asking price, but overall it absolutely is.","Oct 13, 2019 at 9:03 PM",4, 4,

Beautiful visuals, engaging combat, actual difficulty without it being the game's fault. If you make an error in combat it is YOUR mistake, Everything is fair and balanced. The boss fights arent boring, infact most of them are quite interactive and make you feel like a total bad***. Even if you arent a fan of Norse mythology or puzzle games, this game is an absolute must-play for any oculus owner or VR fanatic in general. Absolutely beautiful and a massive props to both Oculus and the dev team behind the game. You guys and your game deserve every ounce of praise it's recieving and a massive congratulations on a successful launch. Very few games now a days, Flat-screen included actually have successful launches with very few bugs plaguing the game and I personally havent had a single one. The single and ONLY gripe I have is how long the load times take, but even that is primarily because of the high-resolution textures the game has, So even that is understandable.

All characters work great, scenery is gorgeous, tons of quality of life details here and there like automatic/manual climbing of ladders and stairs, quick access menus and many other things.  Overhyped games tend to turn out disappointing but this certainly was not the case, it's everything they said it would be and more, it delivers on every promise they made and that does not happen too often.  Absolutely gorgeous, AAA quality game both technically and from a gameplay perspective. If God of War was a VR game it would be call Asgard's Wrath.

To all the people giving it 1 or 2 stars because the game is not dubbed into other languages, yes, I agree it should offer that, at the very least subtitles, I am Spanish  and I'd love to have a good dubbing but that has NOTHING to do with the quality of the game itself, it's ridiculous to say the game is amazing and then give it  a 1-star rating because of the lack of other languages, there are other ways to ask for a dubbing without review-bombing the game.","Oct 19, 2019 at 8:19 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:00:08.747217,Potaso,The AAA VR Game you've been waiting for,"I've been playing VR for years and I (like many others here) have been waiting for the ""AAA"" game that really shows what VR is TRULY capable of: Providing a unique/ different experience. Period. That's what VR is all about. I am happy to report that this game not only provides that experience, but is the AAA you've been waiting for. 

Is it perfect? No. Not really. It has some faults, but what game doesn't? The devs have done a phenominal job across the board. Tons of production value. Cool combat and amazing graphics. 

Oh, and this game has tons of meat in it. It will take you easily over 25 Hours+ just to beat the main story and probably another 20+ to do all of the side quests. Lot's of stuff to do, explore etc. 

The best way to sum this game is like a FPS Zelda/Skyrim/God of War. It has a lot of elements from each of those games and that is not a bad thing. It's even better in VR!

Stop reading. Just buy it. You won't regret it.","Oct 11, 2019 at 1:34 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:00:18.363497,Maaco,A little disapointed,"This game is beautiful and has great graphics and all, but I just don't like crafting (I know, most people seem to like it but I just absolutely hate it) Second  but minor reason I'm 'only' giving 3 star is the very long loading times. This can become extra annoying when you need to search for stuff that you need for crafting.

Problem for me with this game is that you need to craft items in order to proceed with the story, while for me crafting stuff is breaking immersion. For those who don't have any problems (or even like) crafting I think it's a good game and is worth having in your library.

And besides that the game also crashes every 20-30 minutes but that can be due to my setup or specs as most others don't seem to have this problem.","Oct 21, 2019 at 1:36 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 18:00:21.668657,Nasgir,Great looking game. Lots of potential.,"Only been playing the game for a few hours. 4% in and will review again later on. So far, looks great. This is the quality we want in more of the VR games. 
Some of the characters use the same model as the all of the others - don't see why they can't be more unique.
Combat is awkward as the actions don't feel like they are making contact and the death animations seem random sometimes. 
Controls are great. Free movement which is the only way to play a VR game. Although, there is no run or jump function...yet, which is common. Would be more immersive with headbobbing option. Run with swinging arms options. Climbing would be nice.
Swapping between mortal and God is very nice touch.
Good Points: Graphics, free-movement, scope, scale, size, crafting, followers.
Bad Points: Crashes - So far the biggest issue is the high amount of crashes: 8 so far after only a few hours in. Not good. It seems to get overwhelmed, leading to a fatal error.
Smaller issue is the load times: 20-30 seconds sometimes, not too bad on an M.2, but could be a major issue on slower drives.

I agree that it's really good looking and maybe the best VR game so far. At least this type of Skyrim like game. Other games may be more fun and I'm unfortunately not amazed.

The intro shown in earlier demos felt pretty small in scale to me. Pretty cool but as I suspected nothing really special about it. I didn't think that this would be a game for me after seeing the early demo. I still think it's worth a buy for everyone who has PC VR just because of the scale and quality of the game. I hope it grows on me when I get more into the game.

There are some things left to polish. When playing as the god I had to stand in the exact same spot and direction as when starting the game. Otherwise the steering was off. Left was forward, right was back and so on until i turned the right way. Turning made me move around in a circle instead of just turning until I moved to the center of my play area.","Oct 12, 2019 at 4:12 PM",4, 0,

Why only 4 stars? well still long loading screens and not really open world, and compare to skyrim no modification possible, smaller world, not really possible to devolop a char the way you like. its not really a classic rpg game.

Lone Echo is a great game but has a minor second half and Stormland is also not up to Asgards Wrath in the end. 
Im only at a third of the game but its already more than any other story driven game by far thats made for VR.

-The pose to grab the shield is weird.
-in god mode sometimes controls are reversed.
-Not multilanguage subtitles.
-enemies pushing you back constantly is a little annoying.

2022-05-28 18:01:55.225426,zachary.s.dickerson,Diablo in VR,"The absolute best game I have ever played in VR.  I have 100+ games between steam and oculus, this is the best one yet.  This is what Skyrim was supposed to be like, but failed.  It has a very Diablo feel to it.  The combat on hard is very challenging, always keeps me on my toes.  There is so much replay value, you can go through every area multiple times to unlock new content. I bet 100 hours easy can be done trying to finish all the side quest.  The heros are so much fun, each one plays like a different Diablo class.  So far I like the double sided staff that turns into laser nunchucks, lol, so much cool stuff.  I've never stayed in VR longer than an hour, but now I'm in 2+ hours a night because I finally have a game that is engaging and feels like a true AAA release.","Oct 26, 2019 at 11:43 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:01:55.319176,prinyo,Limited locomotion options,"Unfortunately this game offers only headset-guided locomotion. 
It does look promising but I stopped playing after an hour and will wait in a hope that a controller relative locomotion gets added soon in an update. 
It is not only a question of comfort. This is a milestone game for VR, a trend-setter, a game that others will learn from, so not offering locomotion options is a worying sign.
Hopefully they will hear the community feedback (there is a big thread on Reddit about this) and will offer the players options to eperience the game in the best way for them. Looking forward to playing this game that looks like can join or even dethrone Lone Echo as best VR experience for me.","Oct 16, 2019 at 3:55 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 18:02:01.685149,Kagesame,"Best game I have played in VR, period.","You can climb ladders/stairs or simply grab a handle and teleport up/down. Melee combat feels really good. Good weapon types/skills variation. Love the throwing axe. You can throw stuff (food, potions, etc...) to your companions and they will catch it eat it if they need it, if not, they will throw it back at you for you to catch. Lots of crafting, mini games, quests/side quest. Lots of weapon slots on your character so you can actually have a shield, a bow, a sword and a dagger at the same time equipped. Just have to reach for each weapon location (hip, back etc...) and grab them.","Oct 12, 2019 at 10:18 AM",5, 3,
