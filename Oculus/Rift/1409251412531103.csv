I only had two major problems:
- Helicopter level, were you sit in a helicopter and shoot at two targets (I get motionsick super easy!)
- third to last level, target is moving to fast.
If there was a way to skip or play the levels in a different difficulty that would have been better, but I had to push through it and sit 72 sec till my next shot ( got it on my twentieth shot).

Other then there being some small bugs (nothing that breaks the game) this game isn't half bad.
$5 no problem, if it was $15 I would have asked for a refund for the inaccurate description of  it being ""Comfortable"".

What to do?
Also no gun options.","Jan 27, 2019 at 8:31 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:22:21.816051,the_internauts,needs polish,"You have a decent concept here and the use of assets from the Unity stores is well done.  The NPCs on the street are pretty well animated to provide immersion.  Weather is good, too.  The issues are the setup and execution. The bullets need physics. So the the cars. The mission target is often unclear. There should ALWAYS be a way to get to the main menu and exit the game from INSIDE the game. Don't assume I'm right-handed. Let me switch hands (from the menu). Warn/signal people before going into motion scenes. I almost vomitted on the helicopter. It came out of knowhere. Read up on how to minimize motion sickness, please.  You should charge less until you deal with most of these issues. People would give you better reviews then.","May 5, 2018 at 4:59 PM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 19:22:21.832008,claisolais,Full game(BETA),"Good colorful city environment, but still lack of many functions, even some basic functions, like in-game menu(I've tried all my buttons).
Basically a guy in a radio describe the target, and you need to find and shoot the target, sometimes you have to wait for the moment to cover the sounds. Although, often the target descibtions are simply not enough to distinguish the target, one mission even says the target is trying to blend in, it'd be the least expected person, GOOD LUCK with that.
Rifle doesnt hold to your shoulder; You cant switch hand(cos no setting option at all); Mission lack of guidence; etc.
The stylish graphic is beautiful, it has potential, but the game as it is now needs MORE polish.","Mar 9, 2018 at 4:43 AM",3, 9,"Thanks for the review!

2022-05-28 19:22:21.848962,ker2x,not polished,"I like the game and concept but : 
- Feel like an early access, many stuff need to be fixed.
- the arcade mode show a vive controler (wtf?)
- the music in arcade is MUCH louder than in story mode : ear blead
- some camera bug while in car (i ended up under the car ...)
- the instructions are not clear (eg : ""he's probably angry."" yeah... i see 4 angry guys who do i kill now ?)
- press ""M"" to bring up the menu ? Hey, this is a VR game. We have a dedicated button for menu, use it.
- the holo sight kind of s*ck. in target practice i'm better with bare sight than with holo ...
- why did you have to put the target practice menu so far ? it's practically behind us
- i'm kind of tired of failing the story mode because it's hell to find the right guy to kill. I'd like to play sniper, not profiler -_-
- subtitle would be nice thoses who are not native english.

i hope you'll polish your stuff. <3","Mar 13, 2018 at 8:09 AM",4, 6,"Thanks for the detailed Response, ker2x!
