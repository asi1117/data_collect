2022-05-28 17:45:08.347464,Lanzaboy,Another excellent VR animated short,The story is perfect for a 'short'. The artwork is beautiful and the amimation so very smooth. Certainly worth watching.,"Mar 11, 2019 at 6:09 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:45:08.362424,Zapious,Somewhat Dissappointed,"Although there was nothing ""wrong"" with this short story, I found myself dissappointed because of my high expectations after watching ""ALLUMETTE"" 
which is also a Penrose Studios Production, and was excellent (IMO)","May 10, 2019 at 10:30 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 17:45:08.377384,CateBoi,Absolutely amazing,I love the part where i replaced all the files to use it to launch SteamVR,"Feb 26, 2019 at 8:40 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:45:08.392345,DJHeroMasta,Very Short....Yet Perfect!,"Darn, I always find good ""Demos"" after family and friends have left. If you have a GTX 1060, I recommend you super sample to 1.3 as it's nice and sharp. Any higher and you'll drop frames. I also recommend for that anyone who ""plays"" this to crouch down a bit and reset their view. Doing so will provide a more comfortable experience as you won't have to look upward at the subject. Also, a decent amount of space (5x5ft/1.5mx1.5m) is prefered if you'd like to get a full 360° experience.","Oct 10, 2018 at 4:05 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 17:45:11.514992,Kindering,The Little Prince,"This was a fantastic look at the capabilities of VR. Beautiful and smooth,  and since it is free, it is worth a look. If you know the story of the little prince, than this is better still, even if he is wearing a santa costume....","Jun 17, 2018 at 12:23 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 17:45:11.545910,morland914,It's a perfect demo,It's worth watching. The art was perfect I disagree with some of the negative comments about it. Gave it three stars because it was too short. But if the project was to write a beautiful 3minute ish story they accomplsihed their goal.,"Apr 30, 2018 at 3:43 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:45:11.560870,Arqan0,Underwhelming.,"Art is on the weak side, story is boring. Wouldn't recommend.","Dec 5, 2017 at 8:06 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 17:45:11.574832,FastLawyer,These guys made Allumette?,Hard to believe these guys also made Allumette.  I'm a big fan of Allumette and expected this to at least be half as good.  It isn't.  It's way too short and I am not even sure I know what I just saw.  *Spoiler Alert* A guy waters a rose on a moon or planet then roll credits *end spoiler*  Really.  That's the whole movie.,"Sep 5, 2017 at 1:26 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 17:45:14.736377,neuro27,Highly Recommended,"There will be 2 main things that will really surprise you about this short animated story. The first is the quality of the animation. It’s so fluid and beautiful in both graphics and sound. And the 2nd is just how immersive it will make you. It might be a short story but towards the end even I started to care for the little flower! If you enjoy a short animated story or two, download this and try out the future of 3D animated stories.","May 21, 2017 at 12:42 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:45:17.826112,WKGB_Prewitt,Breathtaking Visuals.,This was the first thing that I viewed in VR that I felt like it was actually alive.  Fantastic work!,"May 8, 2017 at 8:38 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:45:17.840075,Duffvader,Really cute and relaxing.,"As many people said, it's too short but it's free. I love the artstyle, music and animations. It's relaxing just sitting there and watching all the stuffs going on and listening to the music. Could do this way longer.","Jan 18, 2017 at 3:49 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 17:45:17.882960,jmalmsten,No impact,I think I've seen it. A few times. But for the life of me I cannot remember what it was. So that says something about it's impact (or lack of it) I guess.,"Dec 2, 2016 at 5:38 AM",1, 2,
