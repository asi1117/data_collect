2022-05-28 20:13:01.800952,AnthonyA45,VR survival horror.,"That's all there is to it, really, if you want a VR survival horror experience in a similar vein to Dead Space, Cosmodread is what you're looking for.",Apr 16 at 7:59 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:13:01.814914,Grimblebo,Worth it,"The graphics might not be much, but that's okay as it doesn't heat up the hardware with the processing power needed. The dark and gloomy atmosphere make it a very immersive experience, and the sound design makes it all the better. Totally worth the money",5 days ago,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:13:01.830871,Gunnerbeavis,Not happy that I have to stand up,I hate standing up to play a video game!! Probably would be cool if my back didnt start hurting,Feb 7 at 3:08 PM,1, 2,"Sorry to hear that. In case you didn't know already: you can activate the ""Seated Mode"" from the in-game Options menu. In that mode, the camera height is adjusted so that you can play the full game seated. Hopefully that will solve the issue for you!"
2022-05-28 20:13:01.844834,indyizzy23,Perfect VR Horror,"I love this game, and it terrified me and still does at times. I can't wait to see what gets added and what the devs work on in the future! This is how you make an intense and immersive vr experience. Plus hardcore deadspace vibes obviously",Oct 27 at 1:49 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:13:01.859794,CptClvtch,Great game. Graphics a bit lazy tho,"A well designed and balanced roguelike survival game. Good atmosphere. Good resource management. Art direction a bit wonky. Graphical fidelity doesnt feel like its pushing what is possible on the quest, especially since the game is designed to render only a couple of rooms at most.",Oct 5 at 11:54 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:13:04.992533,Drawhen,Dead Space VR - kind of - Pretty Good!,"I really recommend this game! Not a tripple A-Game but well done! You have to die to progresss and level up! This game have an amaizing atmosphere! Here are more horror elements than action elements, sometimes you can only run and lock the door behind you. If you have no more ammo and you are smart enough you can let the drones take care of killing the aliens for you. Great gameplay mechanics! UPDATE: After finishing the game several times now I want to give it now 5/5 stars! TO THE DEVS: Can you bring a 24th blueprint to move faster without loosing item sloots? Somthing like booster belt?",Jul 15 at 5:51 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:13:05.007493,Ithalir,Worth every peny and more!,"A must grab if you like action horror theme game. Overall amazing atmosphere and sounds design. I am not usually a fan of roguelike but this one gets a special place for me.

- Graphically this game is pretty (or gory). It is not the most amazing looking one out there, but it works well with the atmosphere.
- Gameplay is fun and engaging. Multiple weapons to get and try, although a lot of them feels similar in damage and play style for me.
- The creepy sounds and music will keep you on edge during your first runs.
- The crafting system is a welcome addition and is permanent throughout your runs. It makes it worth it to explore everything if you have the resources.
- There is a good variety of enemy overall each with their own way of attacking you.
- The cosmonaut (unique enemy) is a bit of a let down for me. Maybe I did not have enough encounter with him but each time I could just simply and easily avoid him.
- For anyone looking for a special type of playstyle or challenge, there are mutators you can unlock to modify each of your runs as you see fit.

If I could wish for one thing to add in this game, it would be a co-op mode with maybe more enemy or/and less ressources. Making the trip with a friend inside this forsaken ship would be a lot of fun.","Jun 18, 2021 at 5:27 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:13:05.022453,XDeathReconX,If you like Dead Space and Dread Halls,"Get this. It's a steal at $15. Great on PC and with crossbuy looks almost as good on Quest 2. Certain lighting and shadows are missing but the whole experience is present and is enough to where you won't mind playing given the ability to play anywhere. Keep in mind progression doesn't cross over though.

It's got rouge like elements you the more you play the more you progress, and randomly generated maps are always a plus. Certain enemy mechanics offer a surprise to surely make you sweat, just because you cleared the hall behind you doesn't mean you're safe. Monsters are on an Amnesia Dark Descent level of scary where you won't want to be around them. This is great for playing a round or two of if you can force yourself forward, because sometime moving through a room full of monsters is the only way forward.","Mar 27, 2021 at 4:03 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:13:05.038410,LePereMecanique,Too good,"I've bought Walking Dead and Cosmodread as my first VR games. WK is 45$ and Cosmodread is 15$, you would think that the more expansive game would be much better, even far better but nope, Cosmosdread is just so much fun, an experience that I was enjoying to the fullest. 
Pros:
The atmosphere is creepy and immersive
The monsters are scary and fun to fight
The crafting system is easy to use
The rogue-like system is great and its fun to replay the game

Cons:
It has an end...
I need more of this please
But for real, the only thing I think would need a small upgrade are the ending, its a bit too easy.","Apr 23, 2021 at 1:40 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:13:05.052373,RaventheGrave,Dead Space/Event Horizon,"Definitely reminds me a lot of Dead Space but also the sci fi horror film Evrnt Horizon. I've died 3 times so far in the game and having to start all over again. Lots of exploration, scary ambience, freaky monsters and a time limit as far as O2 capacity. Definitely unnerving, creepy but  interesting.","Apr 20, 2021 at 1:32 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:13:08.169131,Altervayne,Perfectly between Dreadhalls & DeadSpace,"Buy it, please. 15$ only, with Quest crossbuy (and the Quest version looks and plays very well), you're basically ripping off the dev.

This game is an amazing mix of roguelite, space and horror. You start in a large spaceship infested with strange organic lifeforms, and your goal is simply to get back to Earth. But to do that, you will have to tread carefully among the corridors riddled with monsters drowned in darkness with nothing but your flashlight, a trusty weapon whether it be a crossbow, a pistol, a shotgun, etc...

This game is a rogueLITE. This means that when you die, progression is lost, but not all of it. You retain the audio logs and blueprints you found before, and may even gain modifiers to apply to your next run, like ""NO WEAPONS"" if you're really into existential dread. Other than that, death is death. Your run is over and there is no going back to that specific run. If that type of thing bothers you, it may be a good idea to not get the game. If it turns you on, please, do yourself a favor and buy it right now.

Every run is procedurally generated. You will never tread the same halls. This gives the game a lot of replayability, and completely aces the best part of horror: the Unknown.

Overall the ambiance is absolutely amazing. You will constantly feel watched; even if nothing is there. Regular noises will keep you on your toes, and you will never feel truly safe. With your limited reserve of oxygen, you're constantly forced to push forward and can't give in to your fear and cower in a corner for eternity. Everything about this game is perfect.

tl;dr: Buy this game if you love horror, space and roguelites. It's a steal.","Apr 1, 2021 at 5:29 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:13:08.183094,Jadranko.K-K,Great space roguelike,"I'm having a blast playing this game. It is hard and addictive and it has the best atmospheric audio I've ever seen. The setting has an Alien vive but creatures draw inspiration from other sources like Half Life and even 50s Sci-Fi. The music can only be heard when the action kicks in and it contributes to keep you under tension. There's no chance to save, you play in one go and the map layout and procedurally generated so no two games are identical. This is easier said than done and this gane really nails it. You keep dying and you feel like coming back for more. Some mechanism are in place to lower the difficulty as you play more: your list of blueprints builds up as you find their schematics over multiple games. This makes it easier for you to craft weapons, health aids and other stuff. If you finish the game and crave for more hardcore experiences you can tweak the modifiers and make your life more miserable.","Mar 28, 2021 at 10:38 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:13:08.198055,ThyAntiChris,SO GOOD,"Great horror with tons of replayability, atmophere is so Dead Space, comes close to the same level of fear that phasmophobia brings but you get to fight. This game is so good that this is the first review i've ever written for anything because it's easily worth triple its price.","Apr 2, 2021 at 6:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:13:08.213014,Astrollama,REALLY GOOD GAME MECHANICS AND SCARES!,Playing for the first time i didnt expect much but given the fact that the environments are procedurally generated every new game gives it replayability which is hard to find sometimes in VR,"Mar 27, 2021 at 1:56 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:13:08.227974,Fuzzydragon,would give 5 just for the value alone,"Great followup to Dreadhalls though more tollerable level of Horror, I really really want to give this 5 stars and further updates could change my mind but hear are a few things I hope the dev can improve: Room Variety is a bit lacking, monsters nead more than just a greater variety but less predictable and much deadlier behaviour so that once the ""omg what is that?!"" factor wears off the danger or difficulty maintains that fear.","Apr 8, 2021 at 11:27 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:13:11.320313,Jazz8680,Easily the scariest game I've evr played,"This game is outright terrifying. The sound design is genius, but in the way that makes you so afraid that you can't play longer than like twenty minutes unless you love horror. 10/10.","Mar 29, 2021 at 3:15 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:13:11.336271,user_645841021702021,Dead Space/RandomMaps/VR,"If you like horror and VR this is a must buy. Especially at the price of $15.

You should also know this great experience is apparently done by ONE man. :""White Door Games is a one man game development studio created by Sergio Hidalgo and based in Madrid, Spain.""

Graphically it's no stunner, but I quickly stop caring because the atmosphere and sound are pretty good.  I imagine the developer thought it best to make it playable on everything first to get more sales.  I totally get that, but I'm HOPEing with time Sergio will update the PC version with much better graphics.  Maxed on PC and on Quest 2 there isn't much difference. I can only imagine if this looked as good as Dead Space 2 or 3...but in VR.  Holy crap. I would pay decent money for an updated PC version or a DLC with hi-res textures, better lighting etc. This game has SO much opportunity and I'm excited for it.

In the meantime I will enjoy it as is as it's still a great buy. This is a game with a lot of replay value and I know I'll keep coming back.","Apr 8, 2021 at 4:53 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:13:11.381151,Herger,Phenomenal Game,"It took me a few days after buying this game to Build up the courage to actually play it, but once I did, I was Blown away. This game had me on the edge of my seat, literally since I've been playing seated, and kept me wanting to explore more while keeping me equally terrified. At first I though it was going to be a basic horror game with some roguelike and creafting elements thrown in. I was wrong. All three of those elements are prefectly blended together in a way that probably shouldn't work, but does, and does very well. While the game might not be the prettiest game out there, or even the prettiest VR game out there, don't let that sawy you away from giving this game a try. As a last note, I found out that this game was made by 1 fulltime developer, and I couldn't beleive it. If nothing else, they deserve the $15 it costs even if you don't plan on playing it.","Apr 6, 2021 at 9:10 PM",5, 0,
