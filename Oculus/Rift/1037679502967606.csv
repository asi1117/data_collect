2022-05-28 18:41:36.001728,HarbingerThrace,Made me want to visit,"Really liked it.  It made me interested in going to Yosemite.  My only other comments are that I wish the visuals looked crisper and I wish we saw some of the other famous scenes at the park, including the Geysers and other cool things like that.  Other than that it was great and love hearing Obama <3","Jun 16, 2020 at 2:57 AM",5, 2,

But when will it be on the Go??,"This is incredible to view on my Rift, but until it comes to Go, I can't easily share it with family/friends from my home PC VR setup.. The Tour of the Whitehouse is on the Oculus Go, and that works great, my family loved seeing that! And they really want to see this one too, but I can't bring my Rift places..
PLEASE release an Oculus Go version ASAP! (I think it used to be available in some app on Go, but the internal link stopped working and was eventually removed. This should really be it's own App download, like the whitehouse tour!)","Nov 26, 2018 at 4:56 PM",4, 1,Through the Ages is coming soon to the Go 👀Keep an eye out!
2022-05-28 18:41:39.218125,I-M_BlackShaddow,Win 10 and it works.,"I have NOW installed a CLEAN NEW ORIG.  Win 10.

I am pleased to report that it ran almost faultlessly all the way through, including credits start to finish, with several exits to set view !!!

As a scenery view diorama it is very pritty.  As long as you have an attention span greater than a goldfish, you should not be dissapointed with the ""Movie"" content.

Makes me want to go see it.

However Dont confuse your Win 10 crashes with problems in this app.

I shall be recommending it.

Take a tour of Yosemite and drink in the natural beauty that will leave you awestruck. I know they won’t read this, but it was gracious of the President to take time and for his family to give him the time away from them for filming.

It is sad... The People's House is one of the most awe inspiring VR videos I have seen, and I would love to watch this one as well, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen.
