Story hits, a mystery ensues, strange phenomenon occur, and you're sitting in the middle of it all at the radio station with an inter-dimensional connection to a rocket tow-truck!

I'm having a blast so far, but it's chill enough so I can still relax in my chair with a beer and keep the story rolling. It says I'm 9% done at 37 minutes in, which would be a lot of content for the price.

Oh ya, and the voice acting is tippity-top-notch. Joel McHale, Ronan Farrow, and Max Greenfield as the big three. AAA games don't have voice acting this good, so there's no reason an indy game should, but there it is.
