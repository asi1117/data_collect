The game is not as advertised and when you request a refund after less than 20 minutes of play for that exact reason, you are denied.

2022-05-28 15:39:56.819516,silverdragania,if the game could be in multiplayer,i'd love to have other players in game if you chose for it and everyone is scattered around the prison you're currently in randomly and everyone has to agree on going to night and day and there's 2 other players who walks around as guards that could be more fun/ responce to dev: sounds awesome you'll add new singleplayer features which could be multiplayer like? like one player sends guards in the prison time to time while there's people in section of the room of the prison?,"Jul 12, 2018 at 1:07 AM",4, 33,
2022-05-28 15:39:56.836471,AmosUK,Amazing game and alot of fun,"I had my eye on this game for a long time on steam and never bought it, so on steam you can try the demo and I loved it so I bought it on here as it was on sale.

The game is made with unity engine and is well made, the graphics are good and the physics in the game is amazing.

The gameplay,
So the game revolves around you buying stuff through the day and crafting at night, don't get caught by the guards or you will lose the items that they find, you can make all sorts of things and to progress to the next prison you have to complete quests that are on the guy that you buy stuff from, each quest earns Rep and once you get max rep you can break out and move onto the next prison.

There are only 4 prisons and arcade mode which I didnt like I spoke with the developer and there is a content patch coming out at the end of summer so hopefully more prisons or new modes to play.

Overall apart from only 4 prisons this game is alot of fun and very addictive a must buy","Apr 3, 2018 at 2:02 AM",5, 28,"Hey AmosUK!
Thanks for the detailed review!
I just wanted to update you on the content patch. It will be released in fall finally, but yes, like you mentioned, we are adding a new game mode. Stay tuned for more information by following us on social medias!

2022-05-28 15:39:56.852428,bettwurst,"nice one, but","The game is nice and have a lot of fun. But the Arcade Mode wont work for me. At first, not every time comes the man to start the game, so i have to go to main meniue and start a new game in hope, the man will come and the bigger fail is, that the box wont take my crafted goods. The Box spit it out with a ""red flash"". Please fix this. The same problem said someone in Steam. But the tip, to get the ""debug"" version is not possible here in the Oculus-Software, i think   :--(

Re-Install didnt solve the problem. 

edit1: i will wait for the update.","May 26, 2018 at 3:54 AM",2, 9,"Update: Hey bettwurst!
