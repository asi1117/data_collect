2022-05-28 16:35:02.771843,meuliano,Need more like this!,"Obviously there are going to be bugs and issues with low-budget games like this, but the concept is fantastic and executed well enough to be one of the only VR games my friends and I can (and want to) play together. I love VR couch co-op games and wish there were more like it!","Jul 1, 2019 at 9:01 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 16:35:02.805752,taquitobuddy,Fun for groups,"Pros:
user-friendly
great for groups of friends local play, one of very few VR games like this
lots of modes
frequent updates and improvements

Cons:
not fun as a solo VR player, limited fun with 1 VR + 1 local player, really need a bigger group to enjoy this
few of the modes are a bit broken atm but improving AI is on their roadmap

Conclusion: Easily recommend as a party game for 3-5 total players, 5 stars in that case.  Not recommended for 1-2 players right now, would be 2.5-3 stars in that case.  4 star average.","Jan 11, 2019 at 8:28 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 16:35:05.944357,Demi_Tala,Still crude,"The developer has reached out repeatedly to us to give the game another chance. They have been very friendly and polite about this, and today we finally decided it is time to give the game another spin after plenty of updates.

1. Controls - significantly improved; airplanes are rather fun to play and tanks are somewhat playable now. Cars are fine. Tanks can get stuck and clip through terrain a lot especially on the Mountain map. Because the controls were not as infuriating as they used to be, we upgraded our review to 2 stars.

2. VR - decent enough, but has issues with terrain clipping which means in some game modes, it can be very difficult to reach a player car hiding under static geometry like a cliff.

3. Graphics and Lighting - fairly bland lighting, and colour grading, the game could definitely do with some ambient occlusion. Models & landscape are flat.

4. Bugs and glitches - this game is absolutely full of them, and this can be a major downer for players. The menus are very basic and many times, level geometry or menus themselves occlude each other, making for a very jarring experience. There is also a bug where one player controls 2 or more vehicles at the same time, which will cause them to die quickly and cause annoying ""vehicle destroyed, switching"" messages, in addition to the round ending fast because they run out of lives. 

5. Game modes and balance - the game now offers a selection of game modes, but it seems like they are poorly balanced. Airplanes will completely dominate the poor Gorilla, cows move pretty fast, and UFOs will gobble up livestock in a matter of seconds, making for some very short rounds. The Bodyguard mode is outright weird.

6. Sound - nothing to write home about, and by default it didn't get the sound to work for both the VR player and on the TV screen.

Overall, this is a VERY FUN idea, with sadly a very crude implementation. It could use a lot of polish and fixing, and despite its novelty value is not very enjoyable to play.","Jan 22, 2019 at 6:50 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:35:05.961313,pavilionweb,SO MUCH FUN!,"It's really good, both my daughters loved it and said they would give it 10 stars if possible!
PRO's: Fun controls, easy to get into, different modes and techniques
CON's: camera views are not perfect, sometimes its takes some rotating to see the vehicles when your close to buildings, how about some vibration in the pads when you shoot, what about an AI monkey and human players? how about short name entry (5 chars) so you can work out who you are chasing? looking forward to seeing how this evolves, well done to the development team, great concept!","Dec 11, 2017 at 4:46 AM",5, 7,"Thank you for playing and your feedback! To address your specific issues: we're still improving our controls (with the last update our camera should do a better job of avoiding buildings, better tips on how to re-center your view).
And thank you for your suggestions, we want to add player profiles (and name entry) so it's easier to track who's who, vibrations on gamepad (why didn't we think of that!!) and AI monkey will eventually be added to.

Thanks again for your support! It means a lot."

2022-05-28 16:35:05.990235,zimmerman5050,The first VR party game,"Playing this game alone is ok, but playing this game with two other friends where they're using the keyboard and an x-box controller is a blast! I wouldn't say that this is a good choice for people who are unfamiliar with games outsise of vr. Also be careful of punching your ceiling!","Sep 30, 2017 at 12:06 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:35:06.005195,Twan103,Fun for EVERYONE THIS TIME AROUND!,"While some controls need changing, like the tank steering controls, and in the headset the grip button should be used for grabbing and not the trigger. For the rest tho its lots of fun and I cant wait to see what the devs add next.","Sep 27, 2017 at 3:04 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for your feedback. Just FYI, you can set the grip/punch/move triggers in the setting screen.

We're still working hard on the tanks, they still have to improve. We are open to suggestions at feedback@salmigames.com. What would be your preferred tank controls?"
2022-05-28 16:35:09.144797,ArcticAvenger,Fun for everyone with Friends,"This games concept is quite simple to dive into, yet it has a lot of replay value. If you have a Rift and friends coming over on a regular basis, this game is perfect. 
Easy to pick up and a lot of fun. 
Just make sure to use the alternative Flight settings for the Jet ;)","Aug 28, 2017 at 6:39 PM",5, 2,
