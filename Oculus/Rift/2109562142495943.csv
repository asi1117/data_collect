The worlds all offer distinct moods and visuals which was nice, and once you understand the ""layered"" quality of how the worlds affect each other the cross-world object interaction possibilities open up. There were certain puzzles where I was totally stumped and had to look up the answer to, but once I did I felt silly for not noticing the hints, or 'thinking to try that'.

If you like the idea of a seated experience, and challenging puzzles then try this game out!","Mar 15, 2021 at 9:58 PM",5, 13,

These types of games are the reason we bought a VR set! Can't recommend enough.,"Mar 20, 2021 at 11:58 AM",5, 5,
