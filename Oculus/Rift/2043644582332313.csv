2022-05-28 18:07:10.100249,Troy1637,WTF???,"The guns aren't even slightly realistic, the NPCs can shoot through walls, The controlled andreses is OP, boss battle super early into the game, the barretas are trash and so are the normal pistols, you need to beat the boss to unlock guns that are powerfull enough to defeat the boss, hitregs are trash, guns are inaccurate, and there aren't enough health packs",Feb 14 at 5:36 AM,1, 2,

2022-05-28 18:07:10.129171,Yarmi,Not very good...,"This game is basically a shooter you find in an arcade. You are locked on a rail and have to shoot the enemies to move on to the next section. That would be all good if the gameplay wasn't mediocre and the voice acting wasn't a total trainwreck. Also, the enemies that run towards you look like they were animated in Scratch. Overall, this is pretty bad and you can find much better games.","Jun 12, 2019 at 1:47 AM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 18:07:10.145129,Captain_Howdy,"Cool game, aiming is off ...","The targets in target practice are bigger than the area you can hit, so when you aim on reflex you miss 'm pretty easily, you really have to hit the center
The rail system takes some getting used to, take care when you walk (or move at all) while on the move because you can get really dizzy moving another direction than your eyes tell you

The amount of mobs that come at you at the first boss fight is a bit overwhelming, and I was playing on story mode ;)

But all in all a nice game to just shoot up some bad guys (aim for the head, it's not so hard

Have fun

Dev, please add a quick turn option, there are plenty people who just dont have that much space and with the whole wire thing it's really annoying to turn around as much and as quick as the amount of targets demand, strafing would be awsome too. I found myself needing more than the 2 by 1.5 meters Oculus deems ""optimal""
My own play area is 2x2 and at some points that was barely enough without recentering the play area (which is pretty immersion breaking)","Sep 6, 2018 at 1:13 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:07:13.319639,HiThere_,Early access,"Amount of enemies is OK, players just need to learn to take cover and take them out one group at a time. Enemy health is OK, it's just that players shoot twice more bullets then they need to to kill them. Knife attacks are OK, they come from the front and their attack waves are best memorized. SUGGESTIONS : Add a button to bend down (for those who don't like physically bending down for cover) or perhaps require a smaller player movement when ducking to cover, make it more obvious that an enemy is dead (increase the voice volume, add a flashy red star effect and/or a more obvious ""hit"" animation, add an optional health bar, speed up their dying animation and perhaps make them blink/transparent... so players don't spend half their bullets shooting falling corpses). Maybe use a different color and a bigger arrow size for the knife users, so they stand out as a priority target, which they currently don't. As for locomotion, you could give players the option to teleport or manually walk to the next checkpoint, and add a ""VR comfort mode"" for those who need it (such as a reduced FOV when walking to the next position). The first boss is a pathetic coward with a silly attack : Make him taunt you to dare follow him when he escapes in a car, make him tell his boss he has successfully managed to lure you into his deadly trap, and turn his silly ""arm flapping"" attack into a single more lethal attack that you need to block (such as shooting his blade(s) off), which would also explain why he has to keep running off to fetch new blades.","May 20, 2018 at 12:43 AM",3, 4,"Hello Cyril
Thanks for this awesome comment. The changes for the next update within the next two weeks: player just has to point up or down to reload, enemies wont soak up damage when they die(still deciding on transparency or color change), more notification when you are damaging an enemy, melee and ranged enemies will have different color indicators, allow players to choose different check points to open up different routes on the map and increase variety, adding a FOV limiter on movement, different starting map and a new boss. Please send me an email at danny@badhoneybungames.com if you would like to test out the new features, (your feedback has been great) while we are working on the new boss.
Best,
Danny"
2022-05-28 18:07:13.334598,theregoes2,Decent,"This is essentially a light gun game in VR and that's cool. I've wanted one for a while. There are quite a few problems that really should be dealt with though if they are going to go that route. One is, there are often way to many enemies shooting at you at one time. It doesn't really matter because you have too much health, but even though they aren't going to kill you, it's annoying to have that many people to shoot at once. Especially when you're fighting the boss. During the boss battle there should not be far more enemies than any other point in the game. If you're going to have regular enemies with the boss it should only be one or two at a time, but the world flooded with them to the point that it was hard to focus on the boss. Another is it takes too many shots to kill the bad guys. I haven't played a light gun game in ages, but if I recall correctly they usually only take one or two shots unless it's a boss. Some of these guys take many more than that. Another problem is they have guys come up behind you and start slashing you with a knife. There is no way to know that they are there until you see the damage arrows. The idea, according to tips on the loading screen, is that you look around and notice them coming. Which you will do sometimes, but as I said, there are often far too many people shooting you at once to be looking anywhere but in front of you. I'd comment on the voice work, but I've played far worse, like Ghost Squad. 

Overall, it's worth trying if you like light gun games, but it's probably not going to have you coming back again.","May 12, 2018 at 10:11 AM",3, 5,"Hello there. I really appreciate this review. Gave me a lot of insight. Originally we had a lower count of enemies but when we added the enemy indicator arrows(can be turned on and off by pressing B), it made it too easy for our testers and the other coder so it was ramped up. Sometimes we are just too close to our own product. So the quickest way to know if we actually made something with any value is to give it to you guys with all the rough edges. I agree with a lot of what you mentioned.
For the level that was released, I was thinking of just taking out the first phase of the boss and just sticking to the second phase. Then tweaking that. I agree that its a bit unfair and it will be addressed. Another mistake is putting the difficulty(total player life changes, enemy bullets fly faster with more damage) and the weapon change(9mm is my favorite, I might just take the rest out including the black sci fi blaster) in the options that no one seems to be checking. We are a very small team of 2 devs so I only have one other person I can tap for a limited time for voice work. The rest has been just friends or family we asked lol.

As we are making changes, is there anything that you would like to see that would give this more replay value? Would you give it a shot again after the changes? Feel free to send me an email. This has been my first big project and a light gun game was exactly what I was going for so at least I didn't mess that part up lol. Bare with us, it has been a fun and hard learning process, but we are trying.

Sincerely,

2022-05-28 18:07:13.349558,Valver,Didnt enjoy this...,"I didnt find the core mechanic of shooting enemies to be fun.  There's nothing satisfying about the gunplay for example, the guns just feel a bit weightless and the models dont sell them as being powerful.  Additionally the level and enemy graphics are pretty basic, which doesnt help.  I also really didnt like the forced movement from cover point to cover point.  In VR that generally sets off my stomach - and this was no exception.    It ran perfectly well, but sorry - I  just didnt enjoy this.","May 10, 2018 at 5:35 AM",2, 5,"Sorry we made you sick buddy. I was hoping that we could get a working version of a rail system because we didn't want to do just another teleporter. I tried turning on ques in front of your face, giving you a time frame to mentally prepare to the next checkpoint, keeping the checkpoints close and adjusting the speed at which you moved(start with a really low acceleration then increase the speed after a second ). I'm working to reduce the field of view when you start moving and having a standby que. If this fails, I will try to switch to a point teleportation to make it more playable for everyone.
I have a very small team and our funding is pretty much your dinner lol. We are working to do what we can with what we can get. I know we have a lot we can improve on. Thanks for giving the demo a try at least.

2022-05-28 18:07:13.364518,kevg5844,Time crisis VR essentially,"its really really fun, im writing this after 15 minutes of playing, i got it for free, it certainly makes me feel a large amount of nostalgia for the older time crisis style light gun\hide behind cover to reload style games.  It is great fun so far! As other vr wave shooters go... well, they all get old prettyyy quick, but this one seems to have a story and you seem to progress through levels rather than staying stagnant, will update if I find anything else to say about it.  Great fun for free. maybe worth $5-8 IMHO, Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy the game!(Note:not a dev)","May 10, 2018 at 8:30 AM",5, 2,"Thank you. I loved time crisis when I was growing up! I still play when I go to the arcade. I wanted to make a quick paced shoot em up style game with the Oculus. I was given a chance to get some office space for 6 months so we tried! Thank you for the kind words. This was our first game, I'll be definitely improving the story, game play and adding more levels soon.
Our original goal was can we take an idea with a small group of developers(mainly me and another coder) and turn it into a VR experience in a few months? I know with missed some marks but we are working to improve it.

Whats funny is we were actually surprised we passed the oculus benchmark on the first try and went for publishing review then to release in such a short time. Our plan was to send a light version for review then keep working on the game to implement more levels and game balancing as we waited for the two week review from Oculus, once we fail the review because of something we missed, we would add in the changes. Our release date went from 05/78/18 to 05/08 and we were notified the day of 05/08 lol. It was a little odd but hey we just went with the punches as they say. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions.

2022-05-28 18:07:16.448270,FA1CO,Some potential here..??,"While I did not mind the ""on rails"" locomotion, the shooting and reloading mechanics where not great, the background music while cool, was way to loud and distracting, and the main ""Boss"" is a bit silly. Im sure these Dev's worked very hard on this but I think you guys missed the mark. If you were going for Tounge and Cheek funny then I do get it. I mean it is free so give it a shot but I had more fun dancing to the the music between shootouts then the actual game play. Oh and IDK how much protection my characters suit should have but getting hit 10 times in the head should have killed me just a little side note, VR is so new and I love all of these indie Devs making new games so for that its worth a run through hey its free!!","May 11, 2018 at 12:54 AM",2, 0,"My mistake was letting the ability to change weapons and the difficulty in the options menu after you login. Its kind of out of the way but we were hitting our deadline soon we had to put it somewhere. I am working on game balancing and the boss fight. Probably taking out the first phase and changing the second phase of the boss. Story and stuff, we know needs more tweaking.

We have a small indie team so we are still at a phase that we can experiment with different things for a few months and release it to be critiqued. Sometimes somethings work and sometimes they don't lol. We are definitely still working on improving everyday. Thank you for your review.

Please if you have any other suggestions, email me.
