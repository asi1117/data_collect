Sorry to the developer, but for me this is a biiiig miss. Also joined in a game of zombies, literally swarmed over in seconds, how many headshots to kill one zombie?",22 days ago,1, 3,

2022-05-28 14:37:30.342068,NodnarbDB,Great game- couple small quirks,"First off this game is quickly becoming the best overall multiplayer shooter in VR.  Especially on quest standalone.  Frequent updates and expansions recently has brought this to the forefront.   HOWEVER, there's a couple quirks that make things difficult for new players.
1. new players will find the single-player missions annoying as heck, not because the missions are bad but because if you lose a match, you can't just re-start the level.  You're dumped all the way back to the main base, have to re-open the menu, select single player, select the level and then you're dumped into the same 30 second lobby to 'wait for other players' for a single-player match.
2. bots are non-continuous and simply spawn anywhere you're not looking AND can shoot through walls, really breaks some of the tactical lessons one needs to learn to play this game.  

Neither of the above would be an issue if there was a leveling/rank system so you can matchmake based on skill level but because there isn't, it's far better to get started solo before going up against wildly over-matched online players who'll just kill you over and over to the point of maybe wanting to quit the game.  

Contractors could probably attract more players with better matchmaking and ranking/level rewards as well as a better flow to queue up single player missions.",Feb 22 at 4:05 AM,4, 28,

2022-05-28 14:37:30.372985,Kolgarth,I never write reviews BUT...,"I just had to for this one.

 I've tried Onward, I've tried Pavlov, both are great games. 
But this just doesn't compare... this game is just an all around perfection of a VR shooter, I absolutely love it. 
The graphics are awesome, the gameplay's even better, tracking is great, the weapon mechanics are mindblowing, the settings in this game are comfortable and allow you to switch so many things in order to find YOUR comfort zone. Fun offline survival modes and singleplayer missions, map mods - old Halo and Cod maps, and this is all before I even tried the multiplayer (about 15hrs of gameplay so far)

Now it's not all perfect, but it lacks little things, for example it doesn't track your finger as you squeeze the trigger, mp-7 reloads are a bit buggy, m1 garand ping isnt too pingy :( 

but that's just about it for me. At least thus far. 

 10\10!
 my best purchase on VR :)",Jan 9 at 6:26 AM,5, 82,

The Quest2 version is virtualy flawless to play, no blurry distance issues or lag, comms are brilliant and the weapon selection is great. What i would ask developers is to create a level up system for weapons in mp to give players another purpose to play and maybe some kind of skill progression and skins. Other than those wishes i cant fault the game at all. seriously good job devs. So if your looking for a great game for your new library i really suggest you get this first. it wont dissapoint any gun nut.",Jan 27 at 4:20 PM,5, 8,

 unfortunately the graphics look bad on my rig (aliasing) even on max settings, on the quest2 version it's infinetly crisper looking in terms of jaggies but I have a lot of connection issues too as well as not being abale to grab anything sometimes but other than that Quest2 version is actually better than the pc version.",Jan 22 at 9:45 AM,3, 13,

It has everything from serious to even goofy & fun gamemodes.
There is even a world war 2, ninja(bows & arrows) as well as a foreseeable zombies mode coming up. It just has so much variety, I love it. The guns & soldiers in game look fantastic.

Great sounds, better visuals, new mao and the new guns... brilliant. Well done to developers, great work.


Sounds extreme I know but I'm an old gamer (can remember space invaders coming onto the scene!)... had a playstation when they forst vame out.... then I went quiet and persued other interests. Then VR happened, I purchased an Oculus Quest 2 in November 2020 and now I'm completely addicted again. My go to game of choice is Contractors... Its the best game by far. Onward is too slow,,, Pop 1 takes ages to get into a game then you get blown out of existance by some expert who's swinging through the map in a seemingly inpossible way.. Contactors is the one. Its east to pick up, has many maps and game options and loads of practice/co=op missions to get good at playing it. It inspired me to by a gaming PC so that I could sample the high end VR experiences. ..But guess what... even after all of that I still fire up Contractors 90% of the time I put on the headset becuase its excellent. Thank you developers :-)",Nov 18 at 2:07 AM,5, 29,

The new virtual stock is so bad I had to stop playing because it’s so bad. To be able to move your weapon and your hands holding the weapon freely you have to disable the virtual stock feature. And when you disable it you can move your hands but the stock now is loose. Before, you could turn on the virtual stock feature and move your hands holding the weapon freely (as if the virtual stock feature is off) and as soon as you aim, the virtual stock activates. Now it’s just horrible. The stock is stuck on your shoulder weather you were aiming or not and its glitchy.",Nov 15 at 5:03 AM,1, 5,"Thanks for the feedback.

Cons: Struggling to learn how to play custom maps even though I have a few downloaded.

2022-05-28 14:37:42.942293,Abnthug,Fun game but I have several gripes,"The PVP side of the game is pretty cool. I have very little issues with it outside of the audio, sometimes the placement of sound can be non existent which is just awkward. The majority of my gripes will be with the PVE and Survival aspect of the game which makes some changes that just make no sense.

Example:
In coop and survival, you can't place a magazine back on your belt holster if you grab one by accident, in PVP this is a non issue as you can.

Empty magazines still showing they have rounds in them so when you do a mag check you end up embarrassing yourself trying to fire an empty mag.

Why are the weapon upgrades locked in a skill tree node. If I want the deagle pistol starting off but ultimatley want an AR to pair with it, I have to buy ANOTHER pistol that I have no intention of using just to get access to that tree node and use it. I understand the need for a tier list but there has got to be a better way to implement this.

Weapons just failing to fire, even with a full mag in them, we had a survival run fail due to this, fresh reload, round chambered, gun wouldn't fire and just got overwhelmed and killed.

Survival feels very half baked but I love the idea of it so I really hope some adjustments happen soon to boost up it's quality.

Also, are there plans to add in DLSS since it's run UE4 and some other one for AMD to maintain some visual clarity but get some extra performance ? In shooters, especially in VR this is pretty much needed.","Jun 15, 2021 at 11:07 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 14:37:42.958251,WickedInsignia,"Nice graphics but no ""feel""","The graphics are nice but overall the game feels like a cheap toy. Guns do not sound like they have weight. The reload sounds are abysmal, like you're playing with cardboard, and some guns sound like peashooters or airsoft.

Reload/grab controls don't make much sense with indescriminate choices around what the grip and trigger buttons will do. Bots are incredibly minimalistic with wildly varying accuracy and just do not act like humans in the slightest.

Onward and H3VR are many times more fun to play.
Very far away from a ""AAA"" experience. Over the 2 years I've played non of the fundamental issues I describe above have been fixed.","May 21, 2021 at 1:53 PM",2, 14,
2022-05-28 14:37:42.973210,ryanouno,Gotta say it!,"Ive always been comparing vr shooting games with Onwards and Pavlov that I bought as my first VR games and because two shooting games are quite enough it took me more then a year to try Contractors.. What a mistake it was!! 

I honestly feels like Contractors got the best vibe from those three games (PC version) + Contractors kinda feels like a mix between Pavlov and Onwards - in a good way.

2022-05-28 14:37:46.106961,TheKrampusWrathX20,Potential to be the best VR shooter,"Ok, so I had bought the quest version of this game and loved it. I recently upgraded to Rift version and the game looks so much better. Just amazing. This game is so much fun, but doesn't seem to have many people playing it now it seems. I dont see anything wrong with playing against quest players, but would be cool to have dedicated servers for Rift users or upgrade the quest to allow to have up to 16 players online. This game would be amazing if there was a Ranking system or to earn cash in order to buy weapons, upgrades, items and gear, instead of having a given point system that you have to work with and swap items out in order to use a weapon that you want. It is called ""Contractors"" after all, shouldn't this be part of the game? This game is a lot of fun and would love to see more gamers join in on the action. Hopefully there will be changes that will make this game more enjoyable and addicting to gain rankings or something along those lines.","Dec 26, 2020 at 6:35 PM",4, 33,
2022-05-28 14:37:46.121922,Red_Go,"After Co-op update, now it's good","I had this game since its first release but didn't enjoy much.  I preferred onward for co-op, pavlov for PvP.  But after its single and co-op mission update, it got much better and enjoyed it a lot.  It's fast, casual, fun and exciting.  Since it's released Quest version too, player base boosted so large it has more than 5 pages of online rooms now.

Few things I should mention though.  Gun recoil pattern is very strange in this game, especially it's really tricky to use a gunstock.  Enemy spawn system is also a problem in single and co-op missions.  Enemies come out from nowhere and keep coming at the same spot over and over again.  There's no 'clear out' or 'safe zone' in any area so it doesn't require any tactical approaches, it's just shooting until all the magazines empty.  Secondary weapon's position also got in the way.  I grabbed my pistol several times when I was just reaching rifle's upper grip with left hand.  Pistol should be placed more on right (or left) side.  Last is...  surrounding sound. I'm sorry to mention other game... but in Onward, I would know which direction enemies coming, how close they are just by listening their foot steps.  Those foot steps, surrounding sound system is why I pick Onward as the best VR military simulation out there.  Contractors doesn't have that sound system.  It's impossible to distinguish the direction or distance of enemies by any sound.  It may not a big deal as a arcade style game but as a simulation, it is a big deal.  If Contractors aming a military simulation, the first thing to change is the sound system.","Dec 4, 2020 at 1:08 PM",4, 19,

Different maps, different types of games including tdm, escort, etc. one other important piece is every time I have logged on to play, there have been many people playing/available to play. I play this more than population one. I like them both but I would use the comparison of fort night and COD. Both good just different.  If thinking of getting this or onward, they don’t compare.

Pavlov dominated due to the community servers/moddable content however with the newest update this game just recieved playerbase has grown with crossplatform play and modifiable content including some WW2 weapons!

As a sort of mid-ground between milsim Onward and CS-GO-like Pavlov, this game really fits with me, as I don't feel completely comfortable with those alternatives. It has a growing list of game modes and really extensive arsenal of guns for you to pick from: Carbines, SMGs, Sniper Rifles and shotguns - every one of these categories with customizable sights, muzzles, and foregrips. Everyday as of these times you can find about 10 online games, hopefully a number that'll grow with the awesome updates coming from the devs, to which I may mention the addition of mod support. The game is very polished and has some awesome looking graphics.

I hope it has crossplay with Steam players, I'm not sure it does.

It basically has the smoothest shooting out of the 3 with the perfect time to kill if you aren't going for direct realism like Onward. The tracking and reloading is done very well and a Quest beta was just released so there are tons of people playing.

2022-05-28 14:37:58.828280,EvilFlow,Use Server List to find games.,"This is it!!! Contractors VR is amazingly fun and immersive. Devs are working endlessly to make this game even better. PC version just released a Mod Support Preview beta for anyone who has purchased the game. Mods include maps, guns, gamemodes, etc.. Ha... Even a Jump option is coming to the new build. On top of that I saw a vid showing a wall running mod. This game has a bright future and is not dead. Bought ContractorsVR August 2019 so I know this game well. Since spectator mode is available only on Steam version, I bought it a second time. I play on a Rift S with a 1070 & 6700k and this game runs great with my resolution and anti-aliasing set to ultra, then I SS using the oculus debug tool to 1.2. Don't worry about old reviews from previous updates, be assured ALLs FIXED. Game is top-tier optimized! Everyone agrees and can't argue that gun mechanics are best in class for a VR PvP shooter. Unlike others this game also incorporates a gunstock calibration tool to dial in your gunstock exactly how you want it. A virtual gunstock option is available as well and you can calibrate that.

-Some more things I need to say-

* SOUND - Not necessarily the sound effects in general but they are good, I'm talking more the surround effects. This games surround sound is spot on and directly effects how I play a match. 
* Gameplay - Other VR fps games have let to deliver on the same cat & mouse lazertag adrenaline high ContractorsVR delivers on. It's simply fun.
* Skill - Easy to pick up but hard to master. There's a wide range of skill levels here. No noob comes in beastmode’n it. Don’t have unrealistic expectations and think you are going to be good first day/week...you got to earn your rep and veteran status through deaths.
*Community -A active discord with direct communication with devs. A growing player base with many welcoming helpful players that like to communicate.. A VRML for the competitive players. A community 1v1 tourny just finished with prizes too!","Apr 22, 2020 at 7:48 AM",5, 10,

Half the time, it wont load me into a match! Theres barely anyone who plays it anymore, and once your in a match, there like 2 people! You and 1 enemy. 

The update makes this game a bit garbage, because theres a gamemode that sucks because you have to wait for the match to end once you die, and you always have to play that one gamemode! (What Im saying here is Im not a fan of that gamemode, but if thats what you like, go for it.)  and I just liked capturing the point!

All of this leads to saying, if you want to buy the game, think again, and also wait for some of the new updates because that may just get the game goin' again.

(I dont really know if its just for me, but the game never works for me.)

One thing I forgot to mention is how every so often, the game just completely forgets your username, you get set as some number. And you just cant load into a game at all! I tried reloading the game multiple times and it just doesnt do anything.....

Feels like your wearing a halloween costume and are trying to put stuff in your pockets or adjust your outfit. With Contractors, the circles tell you where to put things, which is AMAZING, but honestly I dont think that I would need them because the hitboxes for your items are made in such a way that they catch everything. I have only dropped one thing and I have played for a few hours. It seems like this game tries to give you a comfortable but satisfying experience. whereas Onward strives more towards realism, which is okay but causes a lot of problems when mixed with VR. Also, to the people that say no one plays this game, you made a great first step in picking it up, and letting people know that the playerbase is small is okay, but if you want people to play, dont give the game a bad review because of it, because only the players can fix the playerbase at a certain point.

Gets really immersive when you're with you team in a firefirght, crouching behind cover and bullets are flying all around you. The main downfall of this game that I've experienced so far (besides a shortage of players for some game modes) is the tracking. On Rift S, tracking cuts out close to the headset much more than in other games, making scopes almost completely redundant. Would appreciate if there were a fix for this (maybe drop tracking on the controller closest to the headset and have the scope snap to the eye?), as it is really annoying and ruins the immersion a little having to hold the guns way out in front of you.

Otherwise, a solid experience and definitely worth the money.","Sep 20, 2019 at 5:41 AM",5, 4,

Loving this game so far, only played againts the bots, which isn't more than moving target practice. Checked out the lobby and played with guns and gadgets. The gun physics and control is amazing, I have heard the multiplayer games are great but haven't had a chance. I have checked out as many of these types of games as I can before buying them. 

This, Onward VR, and Warzone all seem to be the absolute best. Warzone is lacking in content but it already has a 'working' vehicle.

Plenty of weapon and equipment load out options (though, who could ever say no to more, haha?). Same with game types and maps. Each game type (TDM, Gun Game, Control, Bounty, etc) has a set of maps to choose from.. many of which overlap depending on what the game requires (some games don’t need a large map, they may be limited or excluded as a choice). As far as FPSs go, it’s really top-notch. The play mechanics aren’t horribly unrealistic or anything either... in fact, they’re right up there with Onward imo. The prediction models they use for movement and bullet trajectory work well ...even when it’s five vs. five. Speaking of things being realistic... the weapons and environments are unbelievably detailed for a VR FPS. Because of this, many times the map textures are loaded progressively... where a low LOD texture is painted first before the full rendered texture is displayed. All games do this to some degree, but due to the rich beauty of these landscapes, I notice the texture load latency happening a bit more in the foreground than I would in others. But whatever, it’s minimal and it doesn’t affect gameplay. Hope to shoot at... er, see you on the field soon!","Aug 2, 2019 at 9:35 PM",5, 9,

However, there are just a few things that can really ruin your fun, Kids screaming the whole time is anoying to say the least, Spawning is a bit poor, if a concentration of players pins themselves you will be continosusly killed upon spawn without even the chance to grab your weapon (i have been sneaky to exploit this on occation so it goes both ways ;) )  but what is worse is i believe this game is subject to hacks (I do not use this word lightly.... ever, it is usally used as a pass-off excuse for having no skill), in a couple (and only a couple) of games i have witnessed players with super-human precision, obtaining constistant headshots (as in instant kill) at various ranges and are fully aware of all player positions (you can hide in the best corner, they will find you and headshot you within a fraction of a second) not even the best of people i know have even half of that reaction time.

That is the reason for the 4 stars, by all means get this game, it is fantastic fun! provided that everyone is on equal footing, it simply isn't fun having one person absolutley obliterate an entire team with unfair advantages. if this issue is properly adressed and corrected then this game will get it's 5 stars.","Jun 3, 2019 at 8:20 PM",4, 15,

After some searching I decided to pull the trigger on Contractors and after just a few matches I could see why people have been praising it. The gun play is great, the maps are interesting, the objectives are easy to follow but most importantly you respawn after a very short delay, which gives you so much more practise time in any given match. Graphics are great, lots of loadout options and guns to choose from to fit your playstyle. This will now be my go to FPS.","Jul 22, 2019 at 1:26 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 14:38:20.935442,Gabriel_Prime,Now workable on the Rift S,"Updated review: Contractors is now workable on the Rift S. I can't give it an A+ because there is still a catchy deadzone as you move the controller from roughly your chin to your ear. If you like to look down the sights of a rifle, or into a scope, this can be pretty irritating. The aiming is passable now because the deadzone is mitigated to specific spots, but it would still be great if Oculus continued to address the issue, or if they offered an external sensor specifically for your head space. This is a hardware issue, not a software issue. Oculus should be given props for the adjustments thus far—they’re just not quite there yet. 

Software-wise Contractors is quite good. The training area is awesome, the effects are great and the graphics are slick. The capture modes are fun, though the spawning design feels like it needs work. The game feels precise and offers an expansive custom arsenal for you to enter your matches with. The deathmatch portion is probably the weakest game mode because the size of the map is roughly the size of my kitchenette. The capture modes are still where it’s at, and so I hope Caveman Studios expands for a larger survival/deathmatch/battle royal mode.

(Original 1 star review: First off, this is a great game. The following review is for the Rift S. The game simply does not work with Rift S tracking. No first-person shooter will currently work with the Rift S due to the fact that in order to aim effectively, the touch controllers will have to pass by your face. This is a gigantic oversight and I hope a fix is in the works because this technical issue is negating so many game-play possibilities. The only thing I can think of to do is to go through Steam, the Valve stations and use the knuckles. This was a huge disappointment, as I loved playing Contractors on the Rift, and recently updated to the Rift S. Please fix this issue Oculus.)","Jul 30, 2019 at 10:02 AM",3, 2,

It's less hardcore than onward, harder to die, fun game modes like gun game, etc. and it just has a different feel. It's a ton of fun, and there are a lot of great maps including one where everyone is really tiny and on a table full of christmas gifts and toys and all that. 

The guns are great and each one seems to do different damage wise but I'm not certain about that. There is definitely a difference in recoil for each gun and I really like that. They also look fantastic, great graphics and great functional interaction (handling magazines, actions, magaxine release, etc), love the gun mechanics. The variety of game modes is also a plus, there are some really neat and original ones that they brought to the table and you will definitely enjoy them. 

I am having a pretty major issue where I sort of teleport to random locations within about a ten foot radius of my current location as I'm moving. It's really really uncomfortable and gets me killed on occasion so I hope they fix it. Perhaps its an issue with the Rift S and this game but I'm not having issues with any other games.

The only thing I don't like is that there is no campaign mode and finding online matches can take some time depending on what day your trying to play. Hopefully in the future there will be more people online.,"Jun 13, 2019 at 12:39 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 14:38:27.291680,AJ_thedude,Amazing,"This game is the best FPS VR game that’s out, and the fact that it’s still in its infancy is even more exciting!!
Only thing I can’t figure out, is how to get more points for higher gun upgrades...","Jul 3, 2019 at 9:48 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 14:38:27.307637,redGMonster,The best vr shooter,"The best vr shooter i played steam version and this is more cool it is like a kind of black ops 3 but in VR.  buy it now. for me is the best VR shooter, you have a lot of guns.
please buy the game we need more players","Jun 24, 2019 at 3:48 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 14:38:27.323595,rawdmon,"Great game, great price","This game is great.  Reminds me very much of the old CoD4 days, has a really good feel to it.  The controls are well done and easy to figure out.  The level design is great, the graphics are great.  I've played Onward but I prefer this one since it's the perfect balance between realism and arcade.  The only complaint I have is that when I went to select my height as 6'1"" at the start (which is my actual height) it kept giving me an error telling me it wouldn't accept that.  I had to crank it all the way up to 6'4"" for whatever reason for it to accept it.  It didn't seem to make any difference in terms of my actual height from the ground in the game, but just seems like a silly annoying bug that needs to be ironed out.","Jun 4, 2019 at 7:51 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:38:30.422437,Mannalla,Lots of fun,"It did take me a little bit of time to get used to the controls, but once I did the game really became a lot of fun. The game modes are varied enough and the graphics are pretty good. Lots of good options in the settings menu. Deffinantly fool around with the settings to get the game playing the way you want. The game is a good mix between a tactical mil-sim and a more action based fps. There are a decent amount of weapons and variety in your loadouts. Overall I find this game to be very fun and engaging. I think anyone wanting a good shooter should try this game.","Jun 3, 2019 at 2:47 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:38:30.439392,Malhaloc,Handles Great!,"I was only able to play it for a little bit, but everything feels great to play! I do wish there was a way to make it not awkward to hold a rifle with both hands, but that's a limitation of the technology, not the game.","May 31, 2019 at 3:09 PM",5, 13,Maybe a gunstock will help with your situation here :) Protube is an awesome solution here. Also you could try enable virtual gunstock option in settings menu see if it help.
2022-05-28 14:38:30.455349,Double_Chili_Cheese,I OWN THIS ON STEAM AND BOUGHT AGAIN!!!!,This is by far the best FPS available for VR. The devs are very active and constantly add and modify the game to better suit the user base. I bought it a second time just to support the devs and so I don't have to have steam running in the background anymore. THANK YOU DEVS FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THIS GAME!!!,"Jun 5, 2019 at 2:44 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:38:30.472304,DemzOneMusic,Better than the rest. Join the fun!,"Great game, great maps, great community! So much fun you will be laughing with the enemy as you take each other down. I prefer this over Onward for sure. the maps are more strategic and have real buildings with stairs that actaully lead to places. Just got the game and have been finding multiplayer games without any problem! Everyone was courteous and helpful in game! If you were considering, try it! You will not be disapointed! See you on the battlefield!","Jun 4, 2019 at 11:29 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:38:33.614531,t0etags,Great game!,This is the first VR FPS that I’ve played and it’s a blast! I play on the rift s and do have aim issues every once in awhile which I think has to do with the inside out tracking but it is not a big deal at all. I found a good lobby with mics which makes it more fun! I recommend!,"Jun 10, 2019 at 12:48 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 14:38:33.651432,Cyberchaos,A great inbetween of Pavlov and Onward,"The amount of settings and customisability is great and physical stocks can be calibrated per weapon which is fantastic. Gameplay is fast paced. Only been here for a few hours and it's great. It's not H3VR, but as an arcade shooter with a CS element, it's loads of fun.","Jun 3, 2019 at 10:36 AM",5, 1,
