2022-05-28 18:53:06.108938,nothinkings,Great!,"This is a great little game for $2. I've spent way more time than the intentended goal of the game, which is to land a fighter jet onto an aircraft carrier perfectly. The landing 'main' game is definitely a challenge and takes loads of practice and is fun, but the real gem is the final tutorial. The third tutorial is essentially a free-fly for 15min. I like to fly through the first ring and then straight at the island in the distance, ignoring the rest of the tutorial. On the far side of the island there's a run-way, and I like to land there (as perfectly as I can), then take off. There's a couple of cruise ships out further from the island, and they make excellent markers to line up an approach for the landing. Maybe repeat a landing there, or just cruise around, return to the tutorial...maybe. There's many small fishing boats if you cruise down low to the water, an oil drill rig, submarines, etc. other interesting stuff to see. Not much else to do really, but the sensation of flying a fighter jet is very cool. One last cool tip, before taking off in Tutorial 3, get up out of your chair and check out the fighter jet you're flying. If you have enough space in your room, you can actually walk all around it!","Aug 5, 2020 at 9:41 PM",4, 30,
2022-05-28 18:53:06.123898,tastytracey,how to take off???,"Omg did everything   but the pop up pop up and you cant see the button, this nis hard,  very sensitive  kept restarting  so frustrating please make it easier  lol","Sep 30, 2020 at 4:17 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:53:06.138858,WG1,Brake lever conflicts with flaps,"Great starting, tried tutorial, but the Brake lever conflicts with the flaps, I could only release brakes once, can not continue because brake lever will not move when grabing according to tutorial . Please fix interaction precision, then you can ask for a higher price. will update to 5 stars after cockpit switches are operational.
Thanks !","Aug 31, 2020 at 6:48 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 18:53:06.153818,WeZet,Is this real life?,"The controls are a bit shaky in the beginning, but you'll quickly learn not to push the stick to hard and it becomes second nature. I've never been a fighter pilot, and I probably never will, but for just 2 bucks it really feel like I'm in the cockpit. It's an amazing experience just looking around you while in flight, and my brains fooled as I phyiscally experience every turn I make. Awesome! Only point of critque are the shaky controls when pulling the levers, doesn't always register intuitively. They did a nice job with the graphics, especially the water looks very realistic. A way to supersamble HMD resolution would be a great addon for visual clarity. Highly recommended!","Sep 12, 2020 at 6:41 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:53:06.168778,Pluvier,Nice but not flawless,The controlstick often loses connection with the controller.This made the aircraft unmanageable. How do i fix this?,"Aug 27, 2020 at 2:28 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:53:09.286440,Reese1975,Fun experience!,I have downloaded many short VR experiences but this one is the best. Worth the 2 dollars I spent on it.,"Jul 10, 2020 at 6:21 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:53:09.302397,NeoBreed,oculus Rift S,"enjoyable, motion sickness alert.  found turning my head towards the horizon on a turn helped.. just rotate your wrist when you grab the joystick do'nt try to pull it around.. a little off with functions, calm down and cut your speed the switches can be used , landing gear / flaps/.  going back for more , if i;m not sick first.","Feb 17, 2020 at 10:28 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:53:09.316360,BlueMirage,Thank goodness I bought this on sale...,"Thank goodness I bought this on sale...waste of 79p but i can live with that. As it should work on the Rift S, tried to run it on the Oculus Quest using Oculus Link, as they have the same controllers, but no chance. Right or left controller does not grip the flight stick correctly, no matter what i try.  Calibration is way off. Never have this issue with Ultrawings, so i know its not the headset sensors or controllers. Such a shame as i enjoy other flight simulator games.","Jan 16, 2020 at 8:21 AM",2, 20,
2022-05-28 18:53:09.330322,PsyMan,Looks good but plays bad,"Touch controls are dire, you have a job to land anything as you are constantly trying to flip switches that do not respond. If you could use a HOTAS (Joystick) and bind the required keys it would make for a brilliant experience. as it looks fantastic.","Dec 24, 2019 at 2:42 AM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 18:53:09.345282,coffeeguy66,Perseverance Needed For This One !,"Thought I'd give this a go as it was cheap. 

Take your time and follow the tutorials properly, I didn't and got quite frustrated trying to work out why I couldn't take off.  Got there in the end, after about half an hour got close to landing on the carrier, ended up piling into the back of the ship lol !!

Very addictive, that ""one more go"" type feeling ensues and you find yourself trying to enhance and perfect your control of the aircraft.

Graphics are not bad with the Rift S , you can adjust the settings via the menu , had mine maxed out and looked ok, not ground breaking. 

Take your time, follow the on-screen instructions and with some perseverance you will succeed! I'm almost there.

For a quid 50 it's defo worth giving it  a go.","Nov 6, 2019 at 11:53 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:53:12.422053,rawdmon,Alright but frustrating,"This is an alright experience, but flipping switches in the cockpit is really frustrating.  For instance to turn the engine on you have to flip 2 switches in a particular order but very often you'll ""fat finger"" it and flip the switch towards the front on before the one at the back.  It's really fiddly.  By far the most annoying is just trying to pull to bring down the landing gear.  I find myself wrestling with that thing while losing control of the plane by not paying attention all the time.  It's ridiculous.  It should not be this difficult to interract with things in a VR simulation.  3 stars for a nice looking experience with terrible bugs related to interraction.","Nov 13, 2019 at 7:34 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:53:12.437013,demotricus,Awful,"Bad, bad, bad...
Now I`m normally someone who buys every flight sim going, but I hated this...
Control interaction is just dire, it takes you, go after go, after go, even to just flip a switch, it either doesn`t flip, or it flips then bounces back `off` again, (thats if you`re not flailing away, trying to even make contact with the switch..). 
To make matters worse, you HAVE to go through this stupid ""turn on the apu"", ""now the engine"", ""now flip this switch"", ""now take the brake off""... (this one just kills me, - it works around once in every 20 attempts..., EVERY time you progress through even the tutorial... and interaction is just SO janky that it becomes a chore.  Why?? & Why every time? its a GAME, not FSX on ""maximum geek mode"". Having to struggle through this each time, just to start the engine, destroyed any enjoyment for me, it just became annoying. I didn`t really look at the flying and landing, because the frustration with the start up procedure put me off so much, I couldn`t quit quickly enough....","Aug 27, 2019 at 1:27 PM",1, 24,
2022-05-28 18:53:12.451973,dhoward80,Pretty good sim,"Fun sim but pretty lightweight in avionics. Carrier landings are a little more precise than depicted here. Have airspeed and altitude, along with targeting info in the hud would be helpful. Flipping switches for APU and engine start is novel. Engine noise is pretty one- dimensional. More cockpit accuracy would make this an outstanding sim.","Aug 19, 2019 at 6:37 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:53:12.467930,wangcat,5 stars for such a light flight sim,"If you love the immersive experience to fly a jets in cockpit while not bother to seriously gear up with full details/techinics with X-Plane or P3D, you might wanna try this quick one. Though I occasionaly fly with mentioned 2 simulators plus DCS, still bought this one for quick play and landing on a carrier. It's just fun and nice experience. 
Graphics is good. I wish landing could be more realistic...as the rate of succssuful touching down is way too high. ;-)","May 21, 2019 at 12:36 PM",5, 4,"Thanks for the comments, yes, agreed, we're working on enhancements and improvements to the landing procedure"
2022-05-28 18:53:12.483887,higrego,Lots of fun and challenging.,I like the format of competing against real people instead of AI for the best carrier landing score. Fun and challenging!,"May 9, 2019 at 10:18 AM",5, 4,"Thanks for the feedback, we'll continue to make updates and improvements"

2022-05-28 18:53:15.599554,DrewRogers3,Harder than it looks!,"I've got the full game (Flying Aces) and figured I'd bite the bullet on this one to see what the difference is.  Landing isn't easy.  It took me a few tries not to crash, and my first score was a 23.  Essentially it's the same environment and cockpit as Flying Aces, except without the campaign missions.  I've only attempted a few landings but it's pretty fun so far.  Each landing attempt takes about 5 minutes and the grading system and leaderboard makes it competitive.  The landings are short enough that you can compete with friends and pass the head set which is pretty neat. Bottom line, worth the $5","Apr 11, 2019 at 8:39 AM",4, 19,Thanks for the support! Expect an update soon with a new aircraft
