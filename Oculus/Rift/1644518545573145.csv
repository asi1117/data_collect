2022-05-28 14:56:32.518091,Glitch Fandango,"Great, but without Bots it dies quickly","To begin, I actually really, really like this game. It's a unique attempt at creating a brand new VR sport, and i think it's good. It's not Echo Arena good, but it is still worthy of a spot in your library.

Well, at least it would be if you could still play it... 

Unfortunately, like so many cool multiplayer games this one has been abandoned by all but a dedicated few, so the only way to play the game seems to be to pre arrange a session via the Discord channels. Don't get me wrong, the discord community are all really great, but given that the game doesn't give you ANYWHERE to practice before you enter multiplayer you tend to just end up fodder, or someones pity session as they use you to practice trick shots.

If this game had even the smallest single player componant then I would play this all the time. If, however, if it had something a bit more thought out (the AI for Eleven Table Tennis springs to mind here) then this would be in my top 10. It's honestly such a good game, it's just a shame that the developers gave up on it one step away from greatness.","Jun 17, 2020 at 11:53 PM",3, 37,
2022-05-28 14:56:35.668666,KumaWasTaken,Good game but glitches may cost you $1K,"I love the game and played it a lot. You completely get lost in finding your spalce in the VR. For some reason, the guards that warn you if you move out of limit didn't work during the game and I crashed a 60"" 4K smart TV. I know many judging lovers would immediately blame me, but this happened after hours of playing this game and other VR games and having a clear calibrated guard. I was not excited or jumped around at the time of accident, it was an easy play but safe guards didn't work.
Such a disappointment and negative feeling and memory that reamins for a long time.","May 19, 2020 at 1:00 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 14:56:35.690605,SpekkioCT,"True Sport Game, Expect to Sweat","I play this on almost a daily basis on my Oculus app. I also own it on steam. It's very simply to figure out if you would like this game. DO YOU LIKE 1 vs 1 games like TENNIS, HANDBALL, PADDLEBALL, PICKABALL, SQUASH, ETC? You will lose at first but with roughly a month of playing you will start winning. YOU WANT AN OPPONENT? Message me, we have a facebook messenger group of +50 players who message when they ""Hop in the tank"" (start a game). WANT TIPS AND JUST TRAINING? Message me, I have trained many who just started. Trust me, give it a month and you will be playing crazy games, with a towel near by just to clean off the sweat. Its a GREAT SPORT where you no longer have to wait for perfect weather and the ball automatically returns to you. I think the perfect description of this game is Dodgeball tennis.

Just some beginner tips,

-do not ever feel bad about losing, this game take a lot of time to be really good at. It’s a true esport and there are a lot of people with skill out there

-do not hold your shield forever waiting for your opponent to throw the ball just so you can block/return. The point of the game is move and shield holding just kills the tempo and ruins the game for most. The shield is meant to be use sparingly.

-under handed throws tend to work better than over hand. Reach back and get a full swing so the remote can pick up the speed. The wider arc, swing really works well. Lock out your elbow.

-learn to dodge side to side, think lateral squats

-get into the habit of getting strikes while trying to hit your opponent. Strikes are earned when you get your ball in the ring behind your opponent. They make your ball bigger and faster.

-exaggerate your dodging, the sensors only know where your head/hands are. To completely turn your avatar’s body, face the side wall and twist your body so one of your hands is behind you

-a hit only counts if it hits your body or your head.

2022-05-28 14:56:38.850154,ickyv1cky,"PvP sport game, expect to sweat","This game is basically dodgeball, where the ball gets bigger and faster the longer you play. It’s a great workout if you get any good. Just few new player tips I wished I had when I started. 1) the wider the arch on your throw the faster your ball, think like your throwing a bowling ball or frisbee. Reach behind you and get a long throw. 2) underhand throws tend to be simpler and faster than overhand 3) when you release your ball immediately hold down the catch button so your hands are always ready to catch your own ball (lessens the chance of getting hit from a deflection, keep your hands up) 4) best not to rely on your shield, a great offense is usually better because you get more strikes which speeds up your ball. 5) Move! You have to dodge and your character’s movements are based off your hands and headset so exaggerate the motion.  6) DO NOT feel bad about losing, it takes about 6 months to get any good and some people have been playing for years. If you enter to an empty room, practice throws. Remember how you threw the ball and where it hit the wall. Trust me, practice throws. 7) a hit only counts if it hits the body or head. Arms and hands don’t count. Enjoy and welcome 👍🏽","Mar 3, 2020 at 6:12 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 14:56:38.896032,Rinzler-,5 Star Diamond in the Ruff,"If CCP would start supporting the game again this could be the very first V-Sport. I own this game both on Oculus and Steam. After playing for over 900 hours between the two I can tell you that the game is worth the $ and if you can get it on sale even more so. You might be saying why am I giving this game 5 stars when I could sit here and rage on the developer for not updating the code or having some of the worst network and server issues that should never been allowed? 

One word... Community. This game has the best community of pretty much any game I've been a part of. Those of us that have stuck with the game and use it for exercise or practice it like any other sport (which is what it is) will tell you that the players that have stuck with the game like myself are the greatest people you can meet and are always willing to take time and help new players. We compete with each other just like any league and meeting people from all walks of life from around the world makes this game a wonderful experience. 
The vets in the game will tell you their stories of how they've played and lost weight and gained confidence. It might not sound like much, but we all contact CCP and there is talk about support coming back to the game (I don't want to get your hope up to much), but even if there is no support the game plays fine and will provide endless hours of play time against those of us who refuse to give up such a great sport.

CCP if you're reading this, thanks for providing us a lifestyle, but now you need to pick up that laser ball you gave us and make the next move. Fix your server coding and add in statistics, in game league support, along with more customizable functionability and we'll turn this game into the first VR Sport with real athletes.

For those of you who are just joining the game and want to be a part of the community that we've built you can find us on Facebook under Spark-Fu Titans! and Sparc Players League.
Goodluck

1. Rankings and ranked/unranked gameplay - AFAIK there is no rankings kept anywhere so your wins dont really count for anything

2. Needs better multiplayer UX ...right now the system is quite annoying, you get sent to empty rooms too often bc the player count is very laggy, a better way would be to see the individual rooms available so you arent getting the luck of the draw, you know if there are people there...

3. Waiting around for games - you play one game then you wait for 3 MINUTES! this isn't good, maybe make a side game or even a training room to wait in so you can at least do something instead of just standing there waiting for others to finish","Oct 22, 2018 at 4:35 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 14:56:45.201168,LuluViBritannia,"Nice game, but too simple","Sparc is a new kind of game, that can be done right only in VR. So it's good to showcase the potential of VR.
The customization of the character is very cool. There's a lot of hair styles, suits and other props.
The gameplay is cool, but I never manage to throw fast balls. No matter how strong I throw it, the ball is extremely slow.

But the one major problem this game has : there is not enough. Not enough modes (and I don't count ""Advanced"" or ""Beginner"" as different modes, given that the goal and gameplay are still the same). Not enough options (for graphics, for recentering the game area, ...).
My personnal wishes would be : a single player mode (not just the basic tutorial or challenges, but a real single player mode, against AIs) for effective training or for the times when the connexion sucks ; a ""recenter area zone"" button (somehow, the area zone is not at the center of my room, so it would be good to be able to rectify that in-game) ; graphics options (although I do love the graphics of the game!).

Aside from that, Sparc is really fun to play... but not for hours in a row. That's not the point anyway: Sparc is a nice and fun VR sport!","Sep 29, 2018 at 5:47 PM",3, 5,

Over all worth the $20 bill I paid for it, but this game could have been much more if only the developers had greater ambition.

UPDATE: A persistant issue I noticed is the lack of players. At any time you have only about a 65% chance of finding someone to play with, and since the solo mode is little more than a tutorial / single person practice there is nothing fun to do if no one else is playing.","Jul 29, 2018 at 12:40 PM",3, 5,

All the people playing are really supportive and super positive which makes it that much more enjoyable to play.  The only downfall is that the player base is a bit small right now, so the odd time you log in and nobody is playing, but that's when I just go do some target practice anyways.

2022-05-28 14:56:54.736664,Mr.Creepy,Great idea for a virtual sport.,"I know this is insanely long, I'll shorten it if no one finds it helpful. The premise of this game is pretty simple, both players have a glowing ball, which it's held not in your hand but by a sort of ""magnet"" on the top of your glove. Throwing is a bit different than throwing a ball from your palms but you adapt quickly. The goal is to hit your opponent with the ball, and avoid being hit by theirs, or your own. You can catch your own ball but not your opponents. When holding your ball you get a shield which you can use as sort of a racket, but it breaks after 1 hit and gets recharged after a throw.

There are 3 game modes, I'll cover the main two. 

In basic mode you can not only catch your own ball but also punch your opponents ball, which makes it a bit easier since you can defend yourself at all times and don't have to move out of the way. This mode has a quite pronaunced aim assist as well. There is 3 minute time limit to the matches. 

Second mode is advanced, in which you can not punch the ball, and there is no time limit. The first to gets 4 strikes wins the round, and it's best of 3. There is little aim assist here, and games can lost a long time. You'll need to both think strategically and perform well physically to play well. The feeling of satisfaction when you finally nail someone after a drawn out battle of will, endurance and witts is exhilerating. The game/sport will challenge your reflexes and quick thinking, it will wear you out, and wear you down, but you'll enjoy every moment. :D  

Long winded, maybe I've wasted my time here, I don't know, but the game deserves 5 stars. I'm not going to go into more details, as I'm not a proffesional game journelist, and no one is going to read this.","Nov 19, 2017 at 9:17 AM",5, 40,

2022-05-28 14:57:01.042797,raph81,Meh-ish,"Not a bad product, I actually come back to it for short sessions on a regular basis so far. But there's much more exciting than this already for sport games. Mostly I find the ball-thing to be way too slow to really generate excitement...
UPDATE: 2 weeks later, I've been playing this game a lot more and enjoying it a great deal. I've learned to throw faster, stronger, and apply lifting effect to the ball. I'm really leaning toward 4 stars now, but I have to echo what other reviewers have said and regret that there's no ranking system to keep player engagement higher. Even with cross-platform search I often have to wait too long to find a partner and I think not having a league mode of sorts with rankings is hurting the success of this game. And since CCP is pulling out of the VR space I guess it'll never come. It's a shame, Sparc has become one of my go-to game and if you play it seriously it also becomes a pretty decent workout.","Dec 9, 2017 at 2:58 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 14:57:01.058754,Arguyle,Good sport entry,"The idea is good, but a bit too simplistic and not enough depth to have a decent replay value. Its a great variation of a concept we already saw plenty of times in other short games/demos - trapped in a small cage, hit a ball, manage the bounces. Community seems to be small (but mature and great) and from what I saw so far, I'm not even sure there's ranking system or even a matchmaking system - which is a turn off for me especially when it claims to be an Esport. Also its a bit too easy to master and I feel the action should be bit more fast paced than that, yet you could be lucky and have a good match where you sweat a bit. 
However on the good side, the game is extremely well polished, the controls are super accurate and the ball interactions feels awesome. 
To me this game is a strong 3 stars. Together with Echo Arena, they set a baseline for upcoming new esport games.","Dec 2, 2017 at 7:00 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 14:57:01.074712,Jumpinbean,Next VR sports game,Great game! I believe that now with it coming to oculus and vive we are gonna see a lot of improvements than when it was just for PS4. Cross platform play is very fine tuned and I have seen no problems so far. Hoping more people will get this game. Definitely a contender for Echo Arena especially with the atmosphere of the lobby type while watching the match being played in front of you!,"Nov 17, 2017 at 1:44 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:57:01.089672,serio_pit,accessible multiplayer,"I usually don't play online games but this title has a nice light multi you can easly enjoy. Good fun, nice people, pleasent presentation. I only wish to be able to move away the center of your action becouse right now it's too close to my monitor and I need to be careful not to break anything in my room.","Dec 27, 2017 at 9:56 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 14:57:04.201349,Pink_Snow_Fall,Worth the sale price,"This has been genuinely fully realised on the physics side of things, which maks this a pretty skilled game.

2022-05-28 14:57:07.395805,edgeofblade,What a Game! It's Tron's Disk War!,"The rules are very well thought out, from shielding to strike zones. The basic mode gives you a chance to play with ball away defense, but I recommend going straight into advanced. Better to train out your impulse to punch your opponent's ball now.

Oh, and STRETCH before you play. If you go to your knees, you will find your legs sore the next morning.","Dec 6, 2017 at 11:29 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 14:57:07.427719,DerTommy86,Definitely a must have!,"Great game, lots of fun and pretty exhausting over the time (which is a good thing, really). Just the concept alone is worth noting: 
In the ""lobby"", the players waiting for their match to start stand around the playfield, which is super minuscule and gives them the impression of observing a chess game from above, except that there's a lot more dynamic stuff happening there. For both the active players, however, it looks like there are 100m tall avatars standing outside of the field, watching them. I love it.
The game itself is pretty fun, too. I've only been playing it for two days now, but the game mechanics do seem to make a lot of sense. It's basically ""pong"", but in first person, 3D, two balls and the ability to block.
Oh and one other thing: Good job on implementing cross-platform-support. I think that helps a lot in promoting VR to potential buyers, as the lobbies on single-platform titles do seem to be quite empty from time to time.
Anyway, this is now one of my favorite games on the rift.","Nov 21, 2017 at 4:47 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:57:07.443677,Cyclonous,Disc(s) Of Tron - Amazing,"The developers did a knock out Job. A few months ago I saw that CCP(s) created a demo called (Project Arena). Never saw a release for the rift. Today I saw this download which was close in the design I originally saw on youtube. This game is incredible. The graphics are outstanding, your definately going to sweat alot in your VR Headset, so get your hairdryer on cold ready, and get a towel. (Lol). This game is designed for VR / Multiplayer, so dont plan on purchasing this if your not going to be interactive. The queing and waiting system while watching the other players play is a super smart idea, so you can take time to rest and watch. Highly recommened if you are a Tron fan.","Nov 20, 2017 at 11:25 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:57:07.458637,bassow,Tron dodgeball,"It's dodgeball, cyberstyle. Two players stand opposite eachother, each gets a ball and you try and hit the other guy. It's so awesome it got me to invest into the cables and extenders required to move the VR set to a more open space. Minor gripes: You grip the ball with your trigger finger instead of your hand trigger, which makes no sense to me. And I would like to be able to turn off the audio of the other players. Don't get me wrong, all the people I have played with have been awesome so far. But sometimes the background seeps in (TV, GF).","Nov 23, 2017 at 12:33 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 14:57:10.544384,Nightflash,A Dream Come True,"I initially bought this game because it is the closest thing we will porbably ever get to a Tron-like ""Disc wars"" game. This is a childhood wish come true!

But let's put nostalgia aside: The game itself is awesome and it truly is a VR Sport. You're very likely to break a sweat after even just your first match!
It's very competitive in the sense that it is reallly just down to your reaction and skill. You can throw curveballs and ricochet your shots off the walls whilst you also have to keep track of your opponents shots coming your way, blocking or dodging their ball. 

I also love the design of the game, as they really embrace the ""Virtual Space"" vibe. 

It's a great game and despite it's simplicity it's quite challenging!","Nov 17, 2017 at 5:40 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 14:57:10.562336,MarcisL,Amazing!,"My Nr.1 favorite game on oculus rift right now. Would be great if there was some ranking and matchmaking system, multiplayer statistics, like matches played, wins, rating, etc.","Dec 19, 2017 at 3:10 PM",4, 1,

Couldn't resist any longer. My review (with updated 'Star' rating) will follow in a few days.
I just knew I loved the reviews and wanted to play this. I just want to give these Devs some feedback. 

Initial reports are completley Stellar!! and rightly so.

I don't particularly have a lot of space but as long as you can stretch your arms out on both sides it's enough.

Not sure about the guy playing on a Ladder though. Bit unfair :-)","Nov 19, 2017 at 4:17 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 14:57:10.598241,nrosko,Good but could be better,"The gameplay is good itself, but i wish it had Ai to play against. You can do one player challanges & these are ok but limited to beginer & advanced. Selecting these is a bit frustrating as you have  to place the trophy on the table & its fiddly. Another issue is the placement of the menu to reset & quit as i mistakenly caught these a few times, why not just hide them during play? These are the only two GUI flaws everything else is pretty slick.   
Overall it's a good game but hope they improve it to make it amazing.","Nov 20, 2017 at 6:29 AM",4, 1,
