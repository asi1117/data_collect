2022-05-28 19:14:15.844849,SeeRadon,WAS my favorite player,"This was my favorite player for a long time - but the last big update with the refurbished interface, added functions, etc is a mess....

The performance when browsing through my folders changed from top to below-ground...

clarity - not existent

the comfy ""exit""-button - not existent anymore

I wish I could downgrade to the last version befor that big refurbish...

update 28.05.2022:

Its getting even worse - after some minutes it just hang up - even without starting any playback...
I just get the sand glass - Picture on the screen freezes ( but still recognizes my head moving ) and my AIO starts to rev up cause the CPU does some magic Sh*t... only way to exit is Ctrl-Alt-Del...

It also doesnt make a difference between Oculus and Steam Version - both the same problem...

Maybe my 10TB are too much - maybe my directshow-LAV causes some problems with this particular player...",13 hours ago,1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:14:15.859809,ttc39d,Used to love the app,"This has been the best app to watch movies except the the updates break everthing that make it great.  The app used work without long delays and lock-ups.  Now the app has lock-ups and inside the app watching a moving functions dont'w work.  Until this is fixed I cannot use the app any longer ( and I miss the old app).  Now I use DEO VR....This is reliable, but not as many good features.  FYI:  I would have gladly paid for this video player before the last update so long as it was self-updating...................Updated 27 May 2022, The latest update fixed this issues with panning and home screen displays for me.  I did have to un-install and re-install, but it works again now.  I wish I could turn off updates for the next update does not break something again.",18 hours ago,4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:14:15.889729,Shifty79,My new goto video player,"I had a few problems playing some downloaded videos but after setting it to use DirectShow, every video i tried plays now. What would make it perfect would be if we could disable/change the background skin as it's a bit of a distraction around the playing screen, or adjust the lighting so the room is really dark, other than that, it's a great player.

Would be 5/5 with the ability to change or remove the background and adjust lighting.",Feb 16 at 8:36 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:14:15.905686,cheaptrick999,almost perfect,"I really like this VR player, especially after all the latest introduced features. The only missing feature I can think of is the compatibility with youtube's special vr360 flat format, but stereoscopic videos are the rage nowadays so I can sleep with it.

*Edit (16/2/2022): the latest update 2.0.12 broke VR180 compatibility with webm videos. Please fix it asap and, while you are at it fix also the instant recentering command and reassign it to the oculus menu button (it doesn't work at the moment and it makes no sense in the first place to assign it to the oculus button) or at least make it assignable to any key in the controller tab.


*Edit (16/11/2021): ok I got the h265 codec to work by installing the HEVC1 extension on windows store. It's worth noting that this extension is not free of charge on the store (there's a workaround you can easily find on the web though).",Feb 17 at 3:54 AM,1, 0,"Hello.

2022-05-28 19:14:19.044292,OskarZ,does not support Oculus Remote...,"As a Rift User this useless for me. why bother with clunky oculus touch or xbox controller for a point and click user interface? For watching videos the oculus remote is lightweight, has enough buttons and is much faster equipped and unequipped compared to  other controllers, just perfect for that purpose which dont need much interaction. Most other players  support the remote for a good reason...",Feb 4 at 5:50 AM,1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:14:19.060249,trogus,Latest update is hotness,"UPDATE [1/26/22] Joy stick shortcuts and binding working now! Magic is back, such a big step for ease of use with these custom bindings, default playback 3D setting, and being able to jump to other videos without having to go back to main page and lose your place in a long list. Big moves, and thanks for the quick fix!

-------------

[1/24/22] Latest update adds a ton of super helpful control improvements... if they worked. I'm having the same issues with hand controllers joy sticks shortcuts not working anymore.

For developers who are copy/pasting responses about needing to bind keys, that is not working as the joy stick inputs are not being acknowledged for setting binds, and the default binds that are joy stick movements shortcuts are not functioning in-app either (but joy stick vertical scrolling on list views works fine). If you're looking to reproduce - I'm on quest 2 air link on win10. I've tried reinstalling the app, that did not help. 

Once this gets fixed, I'll jack the rating back up, because otherwise, this is the best VR video player (when it works). New update bugs just made it a rough experience.",Jan 26 at 1:19 PM,5, 1,"Hello. Thank you for using PLAY'A, we are glad to hear that you have a good experience with us.

2022-05-28 19:14:19.074212,DondadaSupacat,dissapointed,"tried the build in video browser and was really dissapointed . some videos straight up dont work and the others i tried just stutter and often stop playing just after a few secondes.     
quality of the videos also didnt seem that great from the short moments i saw.
in some you feel like sitting in a box where the video is projected onto each inner surface of the box you sit in and it doesnt look good.",Jan 24 at 3:13 AM,2, 1,
2022-05-28 19:14:19.091166,DeafeningSeal,Much wow!  But not quite Pigasus yet.,"I highly recommend this app.  It is really excellent.  Pigasus is still a little better though.  Could you guys make a couple changes?  

1) A-B loop 
2) looping in general
3) The seek bar is tiny.  You have to be a sniper with your controller.

Update: I mentioned this a while ago but you guys still haven't improved it.  The seek bar width - please increase it!  You just gotta go into the properties tab and change the width right?  It can't be that hard.  It should take 5 seconds to change the width on that seek bar.",Dec 20 at 5:49 AM,4, 4,"Hello. Thank you for using PLAY'A, we are glad to hear that you have had a good experience with us. We very much value your feedback.

2022-05-28 19:14:25.365385,Canuck4ever,Best VR 3D player out there..Period!,"Got a new Quest 2 a few weeks back and tried several free and paid video players.  This one is the best.  No issues with audio like some of the others, plays SBS and UD 3D no issues.  Select flat, 180 or 360.  The only con I have is that the controllers don't seem to fully work with it, you use the dot on headset to select settings or actions.  You can flip pages or folders but the button layout is not intuitive (at least for me).  Other media players have sound issues (since V29?) during video itself but sound returns after out of video.  At least this media player does not have these issues.  Well done folks.","May 27, 2021 at 7:05 AM",4, 5,"Hello.

My only wish/suggestion for this app is that the timeline could be easier to scroll through. Pointing the controller at the timeline and jumping to a certain point is more difficult than it should be because the bar feels only a pixel tall and selecting it just right usually takes a few tries. Maybe if the timeline enlarged when hovering over it with your cursor? Just a thought. Otherwise, a great job by the devs.","Apr 8, 2021 at 12:48 AM",4, 1,"Hello.

I wish the app told you about that... 
Performance wise it works well and seems to do a good job at automatically detecting video properties, but it lacks more advanced image adjustment settings other apps have, doesn't seem to support looping, doesn't let you remap buttons and resize UI elements (scrolling through the video is challenging since UI is so small).

- It doesn't remember where you last were in the video so if you exit the video and then play again it starts from the beginning (This is how traditional video players worked, but in the age of Plex and Netflix people are used to picking up where they left off)","Dec 30, 2019 at 6:40 AM",5, 4,"Hello, Thank you for using PLAY'A we will do the adjustments as you suggested.

2022-05-28 19:15:22.339001,elafynoh,Good player with room to improve,"I like the player, but there's room for improvements, especially regarding the Oculus controls. First, i would suggest to turn off the background music, this drives me totally mad. Except from this the overall interface is very nice and fast to use.

5.7K H265 videos are playing except for skipping with the controller, which seems to speed up the video like fast forward. Some clips are playing choppy.

There is no way to skip videos with the controller during playback, so you always have to get back to the menu and start the next clip, which is really annoying, especially with the background music starting everytime and the page is reset to 1, which is unuseable!

Like with other VR players, there should be a way to navigate and control with one controller incl. skipping clips.

I would suggest the following controls during playback (maybe as an option to select in the settings):

- Front trigger : select
- A : back to lobby
- B : play / pause
- Thumbstick press : mono / stereo
- Thumbstick left / right : seek video
- Thumbstick up / down : Volume up / down
- Back trigger + Thumbstick left / right : previous + next video
- Menu button : quick recenter

There are some other options too, e.g. the zoom controls, which are set on the second controller. Usually you don't play videos with two controllers, so there could be a way to reverse the controller options, so if you press back trigger + menu the controls are switching between left and right controllers.

I would also suggest to increase the size of the onscreen navigation, since the timeline is hard to touch if it's that small.

Also if you go back to lobby with the A Button it would be nice to get back to the video at the same position by pressing A in the lobby again.

List mode in the browser would be nice too as well as random playback (e.g. for music videos).

I think with having some of these included the player is well worth five stars.","Aug 17, 2019 at 2:20 PM",3, 12,

The only website I've been ble to visit is playavr.com.  Not sure why. This one thing so far makes this player not as intutive as other players such as GizmoVR.

2022-05-28 19:15:31.836599,bldsd,,"Just downloaded Play’a yesterday, so i can’t be completely objective here. 

Pros: i have no technical problems with this app, so i think i can give a good rating for the app developers who created it. 

Cons: Play'a has a background music and it's annoying. But thank god you can turn it off. 
Some suggestions to make the app better: if you make the elements of the navigation bigger. At the moment it's too small and not very convenient. So i put 4 stars not 5. Other than that, everything is good. Sorry. Once changed, i’ll adjust my rating.

Before Play’a i used SkyboxVR and GizmoVR. But they both have a lot of small bugs which drove me crazy sometimes. Keep up the great work, just remove that annoying music lol.

Thank you guys i still use Playa app and i like it. Five stars guys!","Sep 26, 2019 at 12:52 AM",5, 1,"Hello. We are glad to hear that you like our App. Thank you for your kind review.
