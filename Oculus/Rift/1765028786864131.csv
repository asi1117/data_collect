2022-05-28 18:21:55.737486,Alacite,It was okay because...,"I like the bright colored graphics and the riding in veheles, the music was okay for me because I like Techno and Rock musics.

However it was missing the impact that ""Show it 2 me"" had which I thought was better; nice catchy music, a pretty (pink) lady (which most guys do like the ladies, fan service), and entertaining (the knives, finger painting and cars .) plenty to do. 

It would be good if Icarus had more interactions because I felt like I was watching an intro opening before the game starts.","Jan 10, 2018 at 3:52 PM",3, 3,
