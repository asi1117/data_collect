2022-05-28 18:03:19.980736,pigtripper,,"Like everyone else said, the controls are horrid, BUT the actual exhibits and VO are very high quality once you get into them. If the controls worked like every other VR experience, this would be a five-star exhibit.

Just get close to the panel on the wall that you want to visit until it flattens out. Then, slowly turn right until the ""Start"" button on the wall highlights in green, then press the A button.","May 21, 2019 at 9:03 AM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 18:03:19.994699,Yoofaloof,Hard Work,"Pros : Thankfully it isn't 360 degree video.
         It's free.

Con : Ultimately let down by the janky control and UI system. Most applications have a default movement system, which hopefully most are used to now, this throws that all out the window and turns it on its head. I gave up after 10 minutes.

There are better museum experiences in Sansar.","Apr 7, 2019 at 10:04 PM",2, 2,

Quite frequently I had to struggle to figure out why my touch controller did not select the menu items. Resultantly I could not enjoy the exhibition at all. More intuitive and responsive UI could provide far better VR museum experience.","Feb 7, 2019 at 6:33 PM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 18:03:23.157240,RR-Jed,"Wow, best VR museum app by miles","Entering the museum issues aside (I had no problems) this is clearly miles ahead of other apps of this type. I've recently studied a bucketload of these app types for a paper, and this is hands-down the best I tried. Firstly, the exhibitions in here are interesting, high profile examples you may know from real life. Unlike other Museum apps, this is converting real exhibitions into VR form. The galleries are even authentic in appearance. 
Not only are the exhibits the highest resolution I've seen and stand up to closest scrutiny (especially the paintings, which really helps evoke a good sense of presence), the multiple VO choices are all excellent, informative and interesting, and every one of the 6 galleries has cool secrets to unearth. Go inside a Manet painting, visit the NY workspace where the art was created, retheme the gallery space, etc. Full of meaningful little touches. Head and shoulders above most of the other apps I've seen. If you're interested at all in this, I highly recommend it.","Nov 22, 2018 at 12:18 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 18:03:26.266923,SimTomMuc,,"Instruction how to enter a Museum
----------------------------------------------------------------

when entering the lobby, select ""tutorial""  ""No"" on the tablet and confirm with the right ""A"" button.  Now move forward with the left thumbstick. When in hight of the first banner turn right with the right thumbstick. Again approach the banner with the left stick. Point with your right arm and stretched index finger to the  @ENTER symbol until it turns green. Now press the ""A"" botton again to enter that museum.

This is a very high grade museum application (especially entring the first banner, leading to the British Museum). 

However it is a shame to design the lobby mechanics so purely, that 90% of the users do not find the entry.  This leaded to a completetly unnecessary 2 star rating where five stars would be more appropriate.

2022-05-28 18:03:26.281883,RiftusMajorus1,I wanted this to work but it doesn't,"The idea is great.  The paintings have a quality look to them, and I could see how this could be a real boon to imobilized people.  The ability to move through and choose what you have an interest in while getting quality narration about the work should be fantastic.  Sadly an alien designed the control functions.  I am not sure what sort of appendages would be required to have these controls make sense, but there would have to be very odd to us.  When you guys get a ""human 1.0"" update let us know.  I will update my ranking.","Jan 8, 2018 at 8:22 AM",1, 5,

Very ambitious work, but lacks polishness on the application control. It takes for a while to figure out what to do even after the tutorial. Also, I did not like that many of the exhibitions were painting exhibitions, and not 3D works that takes advantage of VR. I see great deal of potentials in this type of applications in VR.","Dec 31, 2017 at 1:03 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:03:29.420488,Kevin_Brook,Wonderful educational experience!,"This app really blew me away. I nearly didn't bother downloading because of the all the terrible reviews but I honestly don't know what these people were playing, because it clearly wasn't this! I didn't have any problems with the controls. It supports Oculus Touch and you choose between teleportation or free walking movement. You can even select your walk and turn speed preferences although I prefer to just teleport. The program has 7 different museums with dozens of paintings and artifacts in each, all life sized and well rendered. There is both text and audio narration for all the exhibits that I tested (I've only done the British musuem so far) and both the audio and written materials were excellent. This is the kind of VR experience I was dreaming of and I'd have paid good money for this. I got to see the Rosetta Stone, lots of other Egyptian artificats, the Elgin Marbles and some wonderful Assyrian and Sumerian treasures. Tomorrow I'm going to see what Roman exhibits the musuem has. If you have any interest in history, art and culture this should really be checked out. I can only assume all the one star reviews about terrible movement were based on an old build becuase it works perfectly for me and is everything I hoped a virtual musuem experience could be!

2022-05-28 18:03:38.891158,neuro27,Best Museum App,"Don't listen to the other reviews - this app is hands down the best museum app on the Oculus store right now. With plenty of content - 5 rooms of paintings and 1 spectacular interactive exhibit - this app is really one to show off and keep coming back to. The narrations are done by professionals and are a pleasure to listen to. The only thing holding it back, as others have mentioned, is the control scheme. It's definitely confusing at first, but you can learn it. With the Touch update, movement is no longer an issue. You just point and shoot to teleport where you want to go, and use the left thumbstick for fine movements. Please don't let the other reviews hold you back from experiencing this app as it has much to offer at the low price of free!","Jun 22, 2017 at 7:33 AM",4, 1,

I switched to walking mode, which is literally walking speed. Trying to enter a room, I had to figure out that the icon should NOT be highlighted for it to work. But not the banner. It would be crazy to look at the banner and have that work! And then go ahead and bring up the ""tablet"" while in a room. It SHOWS you what the different menus are, but you can't use them. I'm not kidding, click on settings and it says ""Changes app settings"" or the like, but it only shows you the description of what it does- you can't actually enter the menu.
