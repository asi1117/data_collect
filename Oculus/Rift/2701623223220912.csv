2022-05-28 20:42:31.139823,Stbbrn,Good game with a couple issues,"Pros: 
The overall gameplay is quite good, the scary scenes are well balanced with other scenes, the storyline is great, the game gets quite scary and stressful. 

Cons:
There are many cut scenes in between chapters that are just videos, it breaks the immersion. 
The end game drags on a bit, and ends abruptly. 
I had some bug which required to restart the game. Like the camera not working for instance. 
Use AirLink but not Virtual Desktop to play it, using the later will cause display bugs. 

Still a good game though, I really enjoyed it despite of those issues.",Oct 17 at 5:32 AM,4, 6,
2022-05-28 20:42:31.154783,RuneSR2,"Awesome, but extremely gpu demanding","Got 36 to 45 fps with an oc'ed RTX 3090 and i9 10900K with 32GB 3200 Mhz system ram (measured in chapter 2). That's with highest in-game settings and then forcing super sampling 2.0 (that's 17 mill pixels per image - similar to using res 200% in SteamVR with an Index or Vive Pro). Not sure if this game is very unoptimized or just very demanding due to the rendering of many trees and the dynamic lighting. I'm using the Rift CV1, and the game does look great with oled.
Not sure if this is a pumped up Quest port, but although there are some low-res textures and slightly low-poly objects, this feels more like the PC version made into VR. Old CV1 Touch is shown in the game, I wonder how long this game has been in development.
Controls are somewhat cumbersome, feels unpolished, but get the job done. The game has a great atmosphere, feels like you're in a movie. $30 is very expensive, but you do get, what you pay for - great quality isn't cheap.

Just tested the game with the Index, and Revive works perfectly. Knuckles are shown as Rift-S controllers, lol. Using the highest settings the game was solid 90 fps in 90 Hz using Index res 100% - but motion smoothing kicked in using res 200%. So the game works perfectly using the Index (=same performance as Rift CV1 ss 2.0), but still it doesn't. 

After thoroughly testing the game, I'm fully convinced this is another old CV1 game, like Medal of Honor AB and Asgard's Wrath, and for some reasons Blair Witch PCVR got severely delayed. Because Blair Witch looks totally like garbage using lcd hmds like the Index. Even using Index res 200% there're too many jaggies. In chapter 2 you encounter cliffs and rocks with surfaces that are strangely discolored - sorta shimmering - simply looks totally wrong. Maybe some won't notice it and just think the devs did a poor job designing the game, but devs did not. Now try the Rift CV1 - and it's totally like magic - now everything looks perfect!

My ratings: 
3/5 with Index/LCD
5/5 with CV1/OLED",Aug 7 at 4:49 PM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:42:31.169743,christian.holder.3,Good spooky game.,Glad to see it still gets releases. I bought it on the Quest 2 and now on the Rift store. The PC graphics look amazing. I would like cross save but I understand if it doesn't. Hope to see more games come over from console. Hard to tell this was not made for VR except for the cutscenes. Great game and great story so far. Will update if anything happens. Just want to support games like this so we keep getting them. See you in the woods.,Jul 7 at 10:02 AM,5, 33,
2022-05-28 20:42:31.183705,MrSenseiSean,Rift S - PC version,"Although I've yet to gain any ground substantially,  in the game - so far the graphics have really impressed me. There are tons of graphical options, as well as sound, game and movement. I did have to tinker with the movement options for awhile, to find a setting that works for me. I would recommend using continuous motion, and setting your degree of turning to continuous. Also make sure to change your rotation speed to max. This will help you out a lot. If you happen to get stuck running in circles through the woods at night, don't worry - just keep looking at your first clue via the camcorder (hint: be in the exact same location as where the footage was shot) and you will unlock the next series of events. *(I happened to run around searching everywhere, and managed to get my character stuck in a place on the map I shouldn't have gotten access to, but did so, because I assumed there was a secret place I had to find, rather than sticking to the aforementioned ""clues"" above. Although the cutscenes are done in 2d, it gives the game a RE feel, and I personally tend to enjoy it. I'll update my review as I progress further into the story, but for now, I just wanted to support the game developers for porting this game over to VR. Warning: This game does promote the scary vibes!! Best of luck detectives 🕵️‍♂️",Jul 20 at 3:42 AM,5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:42:31.198665,Quest787,A Different Experience on PC,I refunded the Quest version as the simplyfied graphics robbed it of atmosphere. But on PC this is a fantastic AAA experience that nips at the heels of the mighty Resident Evil 7.  And it ran great on an I7 2060 laptop with no issues at all.,Sep 18 at 1:00 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:42:34.322311,saedus101x,From quest 2 to pc,"Ive playes the quest 2 version and loved itì, the only downside vs the flat pc version was the graphics, but now this game nearly matches the flat pc version. I had no problems laying again to play it, just kinda wished the devs provided a discount for quest 2 owners. Regardless i will gladly support these devs so they make more great horror games for vr.",Jul 9 at 5:48 AM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:42:34.336273,theexpir,Good game. I'm waiting for Observer VR.,"Cool, but the game has poor performance. And the subtitles are constantly overlapped by items. The quest version feels more polished on all fronts. If you reduce the graphics to a minimum, the game will still look better than the quest version. I wanted to get the most out of the visuals of the game. But on 2060s and 9600k, it's better not to go into the settings at all.",Aug 3 at 5:19 AM,4, 2,

Everything works fine with AirLink but the visual quality is significantly worse with AirLink than Virtual Desktop",Jul 8 at 8:45 PM,2, 18,
2022-05-28 20:42:34.368188,spiralwill,Better Than the Original,"Roughly half-way through and this VR experience is worth your attention. The original (non-vr) version of this game was interesting but lacked the pace that I was looking. This version of the game seems to take out a lot of the monotonous dog-walking sim aspects of the original, and get straight to the excitment. This is scary, well-paced, and keeps me wanting more. It's a glimpse into how well survival horror games could marry with VR technology to create experiences that are terrifying and exciting on a different and new level. Great stuff here - played with Rift S.",Jul 26 at 3:56 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:42:34.382151,krisvdvijver,One of my favorite VR horror titles,"Besides terrific graphics, excellent sound, perfectly unsettling music, and of course a really eerie atmosphere, this game especially excels story wise.  I was expecting the usual ‘gather-objects-with-some-jump-scares-and-kill-witch’ kind of game/story, but what a surprise this was. High quality VR Horror game for adults.",Jul 30 at 7:28 PM,5, 1,
