2022-05-28 18:15:02.523686,Aden777,Decent Graphics,The graphics are decent but not fantastic. On the plus side you kinda feel like you are walking through Jurassic Park. If the graphics were better or the dinos were more dynamic like Ocean Rift it would have gotten 5 stars,"Oct 20, 2017 at 9:27 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:15:02.552608,Creolucis,Try something else,"Seems very unfinished, animations are cluttery and clips into everything, and grapichs are cheap. This is not a game, it's more like ""look at stuff"" kinda thing... to bad nothing looks good.","May 29, 2017 at 12:21 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 18:15:02.567568,cybernettr,Jurassic Park for Oculus,"Not so much a game as an environment to explore, but I like that kind of experience. Dinos not as realistic as the one in Oculus Dreamdeck, but still pretty good. I wish you could steer with the thumbstick rather than turning your head. Icons get a little annoying, especially the one that tells you you can't go any farther. I wish you had a bit more freedom of exploring. I like the ability to see the different dinos, and they appear to be pretty accurate in detail and proportions.","Jun 19, 2017 at 3:48 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:15:02.582528,Intrologic,Poor VR experience,I expected more. Nowhere near as good as the dreamdeck dinosaurs. It shows how bad VR can be. Spend your money on something else,"Dec 25, 2016 at 8:06 PM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 18:15:05.706174,Oasistime,Poor,"Originally gave this a fairly positive review because well, it does have its charms. But the controls are a joke and the devs refused to listen to suggestions. Don't bother with this.","Aug 17, 2017 at 4:50 PM",1, 6,
