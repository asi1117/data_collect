Mechanics that worked a moment ago at the push of a button don't work a second later or are very specific, teleportation/movement is very akward around the environments, and trying to figure it out makes for a very stilted experience.

There is no other game controller connected to my PC, and Bluetooth is disabled (these were some tips I found in the forums). Nothing works. I'm told to calibrate just after the game loads by this somewhat annyoing floating robot, but the Touch controllers just do nothing, no matter how many buttons I press or how I wiggle the joysticks. Very disappointing, it looks like a relaxing game to play.

Also, some tutorials would be good, as it took me ages to work out that the cursor was my view, and had nothing to do with where the controllers were pointed.

When I'm about to leave and area, I see a message saying that there are creatures needs that are not met. When I look at each creature, it shows that their needs HAVE been met for the day. There should be a way to limit the number of times your companion robot says phrases. The Tolerons are so annoying. I tried mimicking their moves, but I guess I suck.

2022-05-28 16:39:27.084900,madhaha,Poor Oculus Touch support,"This is an older rift title that was designed for the Oculus Remote. You can play it with an Xbox One controller using the d-pad and face buttons while pointing awkwardly with your gaze. The keyboard arrows also work although I don't know what buttons map to the selection buttons (maybe you can use the Oculus Touch buttons for that?). The game itself is beautiful but basic tamagotchi style feeding game. The voice acting direction is pitched firmly at kids: high pitched, obnoxiously condescending and obvious.

2022-05-28 16:39:49.165841,SvenMorden,,"I tried playing this with the touch controllers. I was able to use the left, right, down, A and B controls. However, when I pressed up (call), it performed the down command (book?). This means I was unable to progress with the touch controllers. I tried connecting a Xbox One Controller via blutooth. This disabled the touch controller controls, and the Xbox Controller didn't work either. I had to restart several times, disconnecting and reconnecting the Xbox controller. Somehow I got the right sequence and the Xbox controller worked. However, the perspective was wrong. (I started outside the space ship, landed underground, pressing the ""aeriel view"" put me underground) I tried resetting the view, and it helped a little, but still wasn't right, but was playable. I think I spent an hour trying to get it working right (searching the net, connecting xbox controller, etc) and was able to play for 10-15 mins. It was an interesting 10-15 min, but now all I can do is fish, and maybe watch for new behaviors. I guess I'll have to play another day to get my next 10-15. I just hope I can get it to work more quickly next time. The graphics were nice, and seemed like an interesting casual game.

Intended to be played in small doses rather than all at once -- plants and creature desires refill over a whole real-world day; also the world itself follows a real-time day/night cycle for a bit of variety.  So it will probably take you a few weeks to see all the things.

Designed for the Remote, but does work well with a single Touch controller (though the up/down actions are reversed for some reason).","Jan 15, 2018 at 5:26 PM",4, 1,

 The only issue I have with this game is there is no touch support and the Xbox controller is very techy sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't and if you want to play the game properly you have to go and buy an oculus remote which is £29 GBP I think they should work on full touch support as the oculus rift is expensive enough without buying an accessory for one game.
Very good graphics, very good instructions the creatures you meet are very imaginative and very interesting yes the voice is very annoying to an adult but like I said earlier this is a childs game so understandable.

It feels kind of like a mix of a simple virtual pet game, Animal Crossing and Pokemon Snap. The creatures you interact with have their own personalities and can do some pretty funny things. There's also a little robot that follows you around and helps out with anything you need. She has quite a personality too and doesn't just feel like a voice over. In the game, you're able to explore (teleport movement) around and take pictures of whatever you like.. getting graded on the content, positioning, and pose.. sort of like Pokemon Snap. This helps you progress and open up new areas and items to help interact with the creatures. You're able to pick different food for your creatures and they're able to evolve and gain different colours and needs. You can also give your creatures toys to play with. There are different fish to catch and catalog, as well as different bugs to find and scan. They're trackable with the 3D audio and it works quite well.

It's really relaxing to come into the world every day and take care of the creatures needs, do a little fishing, food gathering, and bug hunting. Farlands is also free so I'd highly recommend checking it out.","Dec 3, 2016 at 4:00 AM",5, 8,
