2022-05-28 15:13:37.143584,The_Boss2012,Good Game one tiny issue,The game is amazing just i have one small issue. I bought this game on the oculus app and I can't get mods on the game. And I can't even refund it cuz I played over 2 hours on the game when I need to refund it to get it on steam! Plz just fix this and add mods to the oculus app for this game.,Feb 11 at 7:18 AM,4, 32,

(This is a edit aka i thought of this later) Alright this is anther idea i've come up with sence the packs are free you could make it so you can go into settings and switch them on and off so you can chose to use them or not then we get the packs but can chose if we want too use them or not that way parents who don't want there kids using them can make it so they can't but adults that want to use them can or parents that are ok with their kids using them can let them you could also add these feature to the Steam version if more then one person uses that VR headset.","May 28, 2019 at 1:44 AM",5, 20,

However, I feel users such as myself who didn't think to check if the game was any different on Steam, and thus, didn't realise that using the Oculus store variant   would mean missing out on workshop/mod support. 
Devs should reduce the cost slightly on the Oculus platform or at least advertise on the Oculus store page that users can just head to steam, pay the same price, and get mod support included... (Or, even better, bring a mod tool to the Oculus version)

2022-05-28 15:14:18.273576,Bankie,"Fantastic now, awesome potential","Starting with the bad, the controls are very unintuitive, working completely differently from other creative apps. Once you get some familiarity, it works perfectly fine; I just find some of the developer's choices a bit strange. There are also one or two small bugs (e.g. when you copy items, it will try to copy the last item you moved rather than the one you have selected.

Once I was over the usability issues and learned all the basics, it was just fantastic fun. There is a ton of content and those with big imaginations will really be in their element. Taking photos was quite easy, though it would be nice to have some extra controls. The omission most obvious is zoom/FOV, and from my own dev experience, I imagine that wouldn't be too difficult to add. Focus and exposure controls would also rock. As it stands though, this is a time-sucker where you can just spend ages being creative, even without an end-point in mind. Absolutely love it and this type of thing is where VR really shines, as doing this in 2D with a mouse and keyboard would be so much more difficult.

With what we have here, we can make great storyboard stuff, but I would gladly hand over more cash for a version which allowed us to create movies. Simple keyframing and tweening would be really awesome, though I do get that this would be a big undertaking. Just dreaming :)","Jan 27, 2018 at 8:11 PM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 15:14:18.320450,Duncan_Disorderly,Love it!,"Was a bit frustrated the first time I played because I couldn't figure out how to change the buildings menu and browse the other selections, like the cars or people. Second time I played I actually hit the thumbstick on my opposite hand accidently. Ah! You change the menu using the thumbstick of the opposite hand you're using to view the menu! Easy when you know how. Seriously, this needs to be in a concise tutorial. The existing ""tutorial"" tips are not very helpful. 

Apart from this, I was blown away with this game. There are countless items to choose from if you want to create your own scene. I hope the devs add more items in the future. Or, at least make expansion packs. This game is kind of The Sims meets Legoland. The interface gives you the flexibility to enlarge or zoom the scene. The items are easily placed and picked up. Most of all, it has the one quality that always keeps me coming back to games like Minecraft, Spore or The Sims. The freedom to create. The artist in me can't resist a chance to create.  This game is worth every penny, as far as I'm concerned.","Jan 27, 2018 at 5:46 PM",5, 9,

Glad you got it going. Just in case you aren't familiar, when you open up the inventory (by turning one hand palm up) you can scroll left and right through items in the current category, but you can also change the category by scrolling up or down. To scroll, either swipe the opposite hand with your palm facing the direction you want to scroll or use the thumbstick. 

The other thing that might be happening is that you're seeing videos of players that uploaded custom content using Steam Workshop, which unfortunately isn't supported on Oculus Home. Hope that helps."
