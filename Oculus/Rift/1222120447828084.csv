2022-05-28 14:38:42.392419,baggyg,Like a long pretty boring cut-scene,"VR has moved on quite a bit since this came out, but even then the gameplay could have been so much better. I would say 60% is waiting for a very slow mostly static cut-scene to play out with a voice over that gets old very quickly. It really isn't as funny as it thinks it is. Its actually a bit of a shame as you feel they could have gone a different direction with this and made it far more interesting. I snorted a couple of times but nothing worth the price of admission. The other big problem is that the gun play just isn't fun at all. No real impact so feels like a pea shooter regardless of the gun. 

Much better out there in 2021","Apr 27, 2021 at 6:42 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 14:38:42.408376,SolidRustle,Not funny and sinfully boring,"it's an on rail satire game where they make fun of the gun culture and you use guns to do every day tasks throughout your life. It started out promising and then the jokes over stays it's welcome and you just end up riding it out just because you bought it and just want to finish it.....

UPDATE:  I couldn't do it...... I could not finish this game. This will go down as one of only few games in my life time I could not finish due to how shocking boring it is.","Feb 21, 2021 at 7:28 PM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 14:38:42.423337,DUPLICA,Makes you watch an insufferable video,"The game is a bit of a trippy theme park ride, but it makes you watch an extended trailer for the game, unskippable, and nothing in the game was worth the waste of time that was.","Dec 29, 2020 at 2:29 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 14:38:42.438297,cxlors,"As a Pro 2-A person, this was funny.","The game was okay for an on-rails, political statement or all, I found the satire a bit funny as I accept and know this is unrealistic and is just a joke. As this is nothing like America really is. However, funny concept and I enjoyed the jokes and shooting parts.","Oct 20, 2020 at 12:22 AM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 14:38:42.454254,Alicia_Wonderland,Will not open!,"This will not open!  I just get a black screen with a white hour glass that goes on forever. I purchased this a long time ago but just tried it now so it’s too late to return. I have a 1080ti NVIDIA card. 
Also when I try to close it out, it stays running! I close it both in the Oculus app and in the headset but the only way to get it to stop is by quitting the Oculus app on the computer AND restarting the headset. Please fix all this! 

Developers please tell me how to fix this or give me my money back!","Nov 10, 2020 at 9:36 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 14:38:45.603952,Scout11221,"Be rootin, tootin, and by god be shootin","Clever, satirical, and funny all the way through. As an American with a sense of humor, I thought this game was fantastic -- and it made me surprisingly emotionally attached to pieces of cardboard, so that's an achievement right there.

Are there bugs? Sure. But the game was compelling enough that I would immediately restart and dive back in. 

Mechanics are simple and require a good amount of coordination and practice to keep things interesting, and it's tempting to play through again to make different choices. Each level (chapter) is unique, which was surprising, since the mechanics are the same for each level. I was honestly surprised the game was as long as it was, and that they kept it interesting all the way through. Don't think for a second you're going to get bored just because it's an on-rail shooter; it's so much more.

This group of Australians really nailed it, and you can tell a lot of passion went into making it. A breath of fresh air in the sea of mediocre VR games!","Aug 21, 2020 at 12:19 AM",5, 15,

2022-05-28 14:38:45.633872,razzazzika,Fun on rails shooter filled with satire,"I'm lauging so hard at all the conservative snowflakes giving 1 star reviews to this game. Yes, if you are a gun toting american you may be offended by this game, as it completely characturizes american gun ownership and takes the 2nd ammendment to absurd new levels, but its fun, and theres achievements to get and hidden stars to shoot to give it a SLIGHT bit of replayability, but the 2nd time through could be a bit more boring since you already heard the spiel before.","May 23, 2020 at 6:25 AM",4, 37,
2022-05-28 14:38:45.648832,Archer1191,"Painful political statement, not a game","If you actually want a fun  game to play, do not buy this, no matter how cheap it is. This is not an actual game nor is it intended to be; it is purely a political statement, under the guise of a game, in order to be ingestible by a particular audience. 
The developer is a company from Australia, which has strict gun laws, and as such, this ""game"" is propaganda to point out how ridiculous the United States is with their terrible gun control. In order to make that point, the ""game"" leverages absurd stereotypes and exaggerations to highlight how ridiculous the United States is and vilify everyone in the country. 
While the cardboard cutout style of the game is fun and amusing, the gameplay is very minimal and tiresome, there are a lot of glitches, and the story is dreadful to listen to (which I believe is the point). 
I completely understand the viewpoint and intentions of the developers and can respect them for their unique method of making their statement, but as a ""game"" for which I paid good money, I absolutely hate this and wish I could get my money back.","May 7, 2020 at 10:38 AM",1, 113,
2022-05-28 14:38:45.662795,Folly_Inc,meh. its ok.,"This game feels like it was made to be to be streamer/youtube bait. which is the best way to enjoy the game. dont buy it. go watch some one else do it.

2022-05-28 14:38:48.761648,johnnycaps,"Boring,Buggy,Bashing  Second Amendment","Despite the fact that I gave this VR game only one star doesn't mean it has no redeeming qualities.  For instance after playing  this VR Game, I am more convinced than ever that I really need a hand gun to add to the numerous rifles I already have in my arsenal. Yes, of course I have many rifles (2 of which the mass media, a.k.a. fake new, would refer to as ""assault rifles"" but technically are not) and several other firearms but until playing this VR game I never realized how nicely a few handguns would round out my collection.  So for that I am grateful. 

If you like a boring ""rail"" system this is for you.  If you like sitting in a straight roller-coaster that goes at a speed slower than one might walk - this is for you.  If you like propaganda shoved down your throat - this is for you.  If you're a member of an anti second amenment hate group - this is for you.

If would have been nice to see in this VR ""game"" many family members saved from violent criminals by, well, anyone in the family saving someone they love from some a sociopath.  This could easily have been done in the comic tone of the game, which however often is predictable and yawn inducing.

Many sociopaths will probably love this game since the best they can hope for when targeting a home is that no one inside will be able to defend themselves and, unfortunately, there is a good chance that some people might be dissuaded from protecting themselves after viewing this drivel, which might ultimately end very poorly for them.  Of course the elites with their proxy guns used by their security detail have nothing to fear, only poor shlubs without a security squad and who are un-armed need fear.","Mar 31, 2020 at 12:05 PM",1, 49,
2022-05-28 14:38:48.777600,kevink808,‘Murica!,Great game! I love how it shines a light on the ridiculous gun culture in this country. I feel like this is a non-fiction parody of my in-laws.  Coming from a gun owner myself.,"Feb 14, 2020 at 8:47 AM",5, 42,
2022-05-28 14:38:48.794554,cameron.bryant88,Anti-Gun Propoganda,"Never have I wanted a refund more. Pure left wing propoganda that seriously underminds the actual gun problems in America. They use the fun mechanics of shooting guns to pass along their ignorant misconceptions regarding responsible gun ownership. I understand this is just a game, but I am actually offended at their audacity to charge money for a game in which the main ""fun"" mechanic is to shoot weapons, but simultaniously condemn the 2nd amendment and the true benifits of responsible gun ownership. Rant over - Do NOT recommend.....","Feb 24, 2020 at 10:26 AM",1, 65,
2022-05-28 14:38:48.809514,jambooree,Meh,"Quite boring. Found the satire unimpressive. played for 30-60 minutes but couldn't get myself to continue. I was expecting sort of darker, cleverer, almost horrific stuff along the lines of Bioshock but was disappointed.","Oct 22, 2019 at 10:50 AM",2, 21,
2022-05-28 14:38:48.825472,Shirinrin,"Fun game, bad end","Me and a friend played this game (switched every other year) and we both LOVED it. We couldn't stop playing and did (almost) the whole game in one sitting. 

I say almost because the ending was so bad and boring that we didn't finish it. I don't want to spoil but it was so different to everything else in the game, and it didn't really feel like that part even mattered so we stopped playing half way through the ""boss"".

Other than that, really fun game that made us both laugh so much. Great humour. Sometimes the ""movie-time"" sequences was a bit slow and boring but the actuall gameplay was fun.","Jun 17, 2019 at 3:58 PM",4, 14,

- Levels will enter as a black screen and you'll have to restart the level.
- Buggy Audio where it would overlap and loop.
- Sometimes you'll enter a level and events don't trigger. Forcing a restart.","Jun 24, 2019 at 9:45 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 14:38:51.958227,Shanaflan,Good game but has some bugs,"I did enjoy the game but there was a few things that bothered me. The dog speeches are far too long, should be skippable and the sections when you are forced to watch a short movie about guns is boring as hell. I also had a lot of issues where the game wouldnt save my progress after doing the tracing centre level, so I had to replay that level many times, also I had a lot of trouble with the game freezing during the roller coaster transition or the green button not appearing at the end of the level to allow you to continue.

But all in in all it is a lot of fun, with good humour, an interesting plot, a very nice design, loads of levels to play through, the weapons are responsive and reloading is fun with the cute little flags on the gun.","May 2, 2019 at 5:37 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 14:38:51.973187,MrBloxson,One of the best VR experiences out there,"The only word I can use to describe this game is perfect. It's a very straight forward game, live life but with guns. The developers took this very simple concept and decorated it with layers of humor and unique mechanics. The guns work really well and the reloading is intuitive. Even though it's on-rail and you cant really explore, the devs made it work. When I played through (still not finished with it yet) I had this huge grin on my face the entire time. To sum up the game, gameplay is fun and intuitive, graphics look amazing (some of the best I've seen), and it's funny. This game is a MUST buy.","Jan 20, 2019 at 11:22 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:38:55.071505,cjwhitaker96,Easy 5/5,"This without a doubt is one of the better/best VR games there is out there, especially for the Oculus. Regardless of the fact it seems to be made to focus on making fun of American culture, shooting things is fun in VR and I like the classic 50's theme/setting. Accomplishing all your daily tasks by shooting them and going through the stages of your life via gunplay is a blast. Easy for anyone to pickup and enjoy, and lots of fun mini tasks you have to do which can easily become challenging. Played this game for over an hour straight and was unable to put down, but sleep time calls when it's 1AM. Highly recommended, easy to pick up, play, and understand, is only hard to put down. Must have for the Oculus.","Jan 6, 2019 at 4:35 PM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 14:38:55.132342,Aeriesan,Frikkin hilarious,"A hilarious satire on American Gun culture as well as the ""Mad Men"" era of American culture (in all its ridiculousness). Not only did it make me laugh, but I find myself wanting to replay chapters over and over again. It's especially interesting playing as a girl (Play yourself to find out). I think this game is best played blind. Don't watch a Let's Play. Enjoy it on your own first. It's definitely made to be experienced in VR.","Mar 17, 2018 at 5:52 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:38:58.215709,javerlaw,Hilarious Extreme Take on Gun Culture,"One of the more unique, humourous and in a few ways almost disturbing games I have played in vr. Think a much longer Job Simulatoresque experience that revolves solely around using guns and  spoofing American gun culture to the extreme. The writing and voice acting are really hilarious and there were genuine moments that made me laugh both out of the sheer humour of the moment as well as the eerie parallel to certain real world events (ya...everyone with guns in a church celebrating guns happened recently in the US).

Played through the entire game in about 3 hours so it's not exceptionally long and it may not have much replay value....but it will have show your friends a bizarre VR game value in spades!

Gameplay was pretty spot on with only slightly frustrating reloading moments, particularly at the end climax, but in that moment it was probably a design choice to increase the difficulty.

Best moment spoiler alert....""Deer Hunter"" russian roulette....nuff said.","Mar 16, 2018 at 5:30 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:38:58.230669,ZAKRTV,The best part? It's hilarious!,"I haven't played much of it yet, however writing an early review just so other people could see it and confidently pick it up, since it is a fresh game on the store.

I got an impression that it is a slow paced game. After I finished a session of Robot Recall, this was perfect to cool down.

I found that shooting (especially scoped rifle) and reloading mechanics are very well implemented and feels closer to life than any other vr game I played (if you know any similar ones, please let me know).

The best thing about this game is writing and the humour. Some people say that there is too much speech to wait through before gameplay but I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the narration.","Mar 18, 2018 at 8:51 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:38:58.245629,Romkslrqusz,"Mildly Amusing, at times","I was looking forward to this game, as satire is something I absolutely love.

This game got a few chuckles out of me, but overall it just feels like a series of pretty bland shooting galleries. I'd probably be sorely disappointed if I hadn't paid for the game with my free Oculus credit.","Mar 24, 2018 at 11:48 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 14:38:58.260589,jutjut1134,"3 1/2 stars, slow paced","Whilst I have enjoyed the game despite its often slow paced progression, my current main issue is technical at best. Currently stuck at the car wash level as it will not allow me to load said submachine gun? perhaps Im doing something wrong. Will do a fresh play through Regardless my rating is more based in the pacing. It feels like I spend a bit too much time standing around staring at things with nothing to interact with waiting for a dog to talk.... It seems almost purposely slowed down to legnthen the play through...... Fun, and often forgetable. A great play through, but a hard sell at the current price. True review 4 stars for story, 3 stars for playability, 3 and a half star overall. Suggestions, give me more random things to interact with during the slow bits... let me shoot the ballons at the carnival, or random birds. etc etc etc","Mar 17, 2018 at 10:41 AM",3, 2,
