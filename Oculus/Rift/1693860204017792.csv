2022-05-28 19:13:38.851793,taquitobuddy,Incredible spells incredibly boring game,"Pros:
-Spellcasting with voice is really well done, even if the spell texts are poorly translated.  Good variety and number of spells.  Really awesome feature that would be amazing in a better game.
-Decent loot variety with various stats and attributes.

Cons: 
-The entire game is incredibly boring and offers absolutely no challenge.  All the cool spells and loot are pointless, because everything in the game can be easily killed with no effort.  You can only play Normal mode at first, once you beat that which took me about 4-6 hours (99% of the time was slowly walking around, 1% of the time was mindlessly killing enemies with no effort), then you can do Hard mode, which is just as easy as Normal.
-The World is huge, which would normally be a good thing, but you walk sooo slow, and walking faster uses mana.  Also the world is full of pointless monsters that offer 0 challenge.
-The environment graphics are terrible.  The monsters and some other things are ""ok but not great"".
-No crossplay with Oculus/Steam in multiplayer, and no private multiplayer.

It is a real shame there is such a cool feature (the spells and spellcasting) hidden in this extremely boring game.  With some better design decisions this could have been one of only a few great VR RPG's.  Hard to rate this, really only deserves 2 stars, but I'm going to give it a free star because I loved the spellcasting.","May 1, 2019 at 12:17 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 19:13:38.867750,EviLorD,I enjoy this game .. I just want 1 thing,"UPDATE REVIEW - Needed additions. 
1.  Choice for SMOOTH TURN  or SNAP TURN.   Every VR game should let the user choose smooth or snap for turning.  
2. A way to set the volume of sounds in game.  When I am playing with friends I would like to hear them louder then the game sounds..   
3.  A setting for people who can not stand.   

Looking for a Discord for this game.. anyone know if there is one?","Nov 14, 2018 at 1:54 PM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 19:13:38.897670,Lyari_Dordri,From 5 Stars To 2 Stars To 1 Star,"I really like this game. I like playing it with my friend and like that it's across LAN.
I like the easy difficulty, it seems as if it was intended for fun and fun is what we have playing it. I like the voice command spells and the way combat works throughout the game. Thankyou to the developer for an enjoyable VR experience.

EDIT: Looks like you can't play this on LAN, which is a big issue for us and we were starting to notice a lot of graphical glitches, possibly from the online connectivity requirement. We like to play privately and there is no option to with the online multiplayer so potentially, people can drop in. We like the game, however with these issues in mind, unless things change we will probably not play it again. From 5 stars to 2.

EDIT 2: Thought I'd try it again, voice commands do not even work for me anymore (even though my friend can hear me in game), which basically makes this game unplayable, as they are a large part of the game. This reduces my rating to the bare minimum of 1. I would give it none if i could.","Mar 13, 2019 at 10:20 AM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 19:13:42.028296,TsaberX,I have the power!,"Gameplay - 4
Controls are responsive, once you understand how to open everything (spell book, map, and inventory) it's a click, point, click system.  Casting spells are all done via voice, and its pretty forgiving on remebering every line of the cast.  Activation time is a little over 1 second. I dont think this game was meant to be extremely difficult, its more grinding and taking on monsters with powerful spells.
Graphics - 4
Though there are some redundances with the character models on basic mobs, mini bosses and some special ones are really intresting in design.  Their moment flows with the world and the world is vast.  The magicall spells are amazing to see in action, they did a great job with the animation.
Sound - 2
The sound itself is not so bad but some of the bad parts hurt the emersion.  The perseption of sound it off.  Things in the distance being hit sound like its right beside your or even louder than is should be if it was beside you (wooden barrels). 
Story - 2 Really not much here, there is a very little tutorial that gives you some info but you really have to learn as you go. There is evil in the world and you fight hordes of monsters to fix it.  Pretty much that's it. 

Emersion - 4
Since I dinged this game on the sound I won't double ding on this category. You do feel like a powerful wizard, witch,  sorcerer  (though always male) and you feel like the world is huge.  The mobs will scare you if are caught off guard, you get flusterd with hordes or monsters attacking you,  and you will get tired from all the walking you have to do in this game. But it feels like I really am inside of Wow or Everyquest, or Diablo.","May 10, 2018 at 6:03 AM",4, 13,
2022-05-28 19:13:42.042259,Mike_Matrix,"OMG, GET THIS GAME!! WOW FUN AWESOME","Hey I am not one to write reviews, infact I have had the Rift from the start and I have never done one. This game though is FUNNNN! Get this game!. I had to take a min and let everyone know that this game is my FAV. I hope they keep updating it and making new levels to play.  WOW, did I say this game was fun, IT IS FUNNNNN. LOVE IT. Thanks to the DEVS that made this AWESOME game. Your Fan Mike.","May 5, 2018 at 1:26 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:13:42.058216,MagicCR,,"Great fun for a couple hours, but since the dev. decided to play out the lack of content with a ridiculously easy 'Normal' mode, which requires completion before unlocking 'Hard' or 'Hell', you're stuck suffering your way through fighting AI with the equivalent of an 8 y/o's constitution.  Let us play whatever difficulty we want, from the start, for God's sake.  This bandwagon of covering gaps in content with mode locking is getting tiresome, transparent, and it's going to backfire.","May 9, 2018 at 6:43 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 19:13:42.073176,Shiroe_Arkstrom,7/10,"So, as a skeptic, I went ahead and saw flawless 5/5's from 4 users. So I bought it to try myself!

Now, let's be clear first. You cannot seem to select any difficulty other than normal, probably until you beat the game. There are 2 higher difficulties above that. Normal is super easy, and is only challenging when you fight a REAL boss, which is at the very end of each stage. It took me about 5 hours to beat the first 2 levels. The reason it took so long will be discussed in a bit. All of the enemies, even the big ones, are cannon fodder even right at the start. You get one spell at the start, which is fireball, and it flings a hot flaming rock at the enemy, pretty much one-shotting everything except enemies with purple bars like mini-bosses and bosses.

What sucks about this game in particular, isn't the combat itself, but the total lack of any challenge or interest in any of the enemies so far. Currently I could rush through an area, and end off surrounded, only to freeze everything around me, and smack everything to death in one hit with my lightning enchanted sword (which is a spell you can get).

Next up, the areas themselves.

The second area especially, is SUPER BORING AND MASSIVE. The map is useless as it covers only the vicinity you can see anyways, and the objective sometimes is behind a crossroads which you have to guess where to go. Which on its own is fine, and could be cool, if everything wasn't exactly the same in every direction. The first area wasn't nearly as bad, most of the time follow the road, and the map has the objective as an arrow in one of the corners you could understand and follow. With the maps being massive, you can easily get bored of one-shotting enemies as you walk through the area, which isn't a good thing.

As I am running out of text here I'll have to just wrap it up. The game is fun, but bland still. It has promise, and the spells feel epic. It's cheap, and the power-walk can be addicting. Meteor spam FTW.","May 9, 2018 at 7:36 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:13:42.088136,105173251,Diablo in VR,"Imagine Diablo in VR and you get The Broken Seal. Its still very rough on the edges and a bit buggy but what's already there makes a lot of fun. Leveling, grinding, searching for sweet loot. Everything is already there. Give this game some more time and I think it will improve.

The main feature ""casting Spells"" by speaking works great so far.. You just feel powerfull summoning a rift in the sky and destroying your enemies with a giant meteroid.","May 4, 2018 at 11:55 AM",5, 5,
