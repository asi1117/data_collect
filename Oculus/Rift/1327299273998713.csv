2022-05-28 19:45:42.813134,FastLawyer,best VR runner,So this is the best VR runner you can currently experience.  The visuals are trippy.  The music is good.  The game is non-stressful.  You can begin from certain checkpoints even when you fail.  Game restarts quickly and right where the song left off.,"Dec 16, 2017 at 5:13 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 19:45:42.843054,Jesus_Silence,Awesome Trip,"It's one of my favourite VR games. The music rocks and the visuals are nuts. It has a ton of levels, so it's great value for money.","Sep 16, 2017 at 8:31 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:45:42.858520,baggyg,Good Music - thats about it,"Endless runner type game that, very uncomfortably, uses you neck tilt to steer. Would have probably given it another start or two if you could navigate with the gamepad. Otherwise just going through a tunnel trying to avoid things. Only real positive is the music is quite good.","Aug 20, 2017 at 5:07 AM",1, 0,
