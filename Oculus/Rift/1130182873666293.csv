Some mp4 play, but anything else cannot due to being inside a MKV container.  This program is either unable to access codecs or is missing its own.. unsure..","Jun 20, 2021 at 4:47 AM",1, 4,"Hi, don't know if you're get this reply but if you like I would like to offer some help and also access to the Oculus beta of the latest build.

2022-05-28 13:06:07.620051,Knightshade.Steve,Exceptional,"Whirligig now has a hue slider! 
This video player is as near-perfect as they come.

What it is today is definately worth what little money he asks for it. 
You won't regret buying it.","Jan 24, 2021 at 9:16 PM",5, 4,
