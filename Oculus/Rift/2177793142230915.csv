2022-05-28 19:34:20.754661,price_kelley,Beyod Poor - Tech partially to blame,"Its no new news that the original Oculus devices from CV1 suffer from god rays and very obvious definition issues but knowing this and then developing an app that completely diregards these well reported facts is moronic, which also sums up channel 4 these days, as long as its target market are millenials or illegal migrants - nothing else matters ""were winning!"" - well no, no your not.... there were no issues with the download or buffering problems, it ran well but the content or rather lack of content is disturbing, what was the point of creating a vr app? just to tick off the tech diversity check box? its useless unless your still trggered about Grenfell (like the event honestly effected you!lol), just more agenda driven woke exuses of apps for the anorexic market place (the be tried and uninstalled), seriously though... the years of content that could have been put together for the apps library and you got Grenfell and an intro!  Shockingly bad! C4 take this ""L"", print it off because YOU OWN this L.",Sep 16 at 8:02 AM,1, 1,

2022-05-28 19:34:20.784582,mechromencer3k,Hmm,Good idea but 3 vids and one being an intro? This really needs a lot more content in order for it to be useful or even practical app. I hope over time that this does get filled with content and GBBO content too as that would be good as the intro suggests!,"Nov 17, 2019 at 4:25 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 19:34:20.813504,vtid,Disappointed.  Not visually immersive.,"I'm sure the content will grow, but currently there are only 2 videos to watch.  One is short and one is very long.  The long video refers to a horrific recent tradegy, but really has no advantage in being in VR over 2D.  The video would have been far better with the higher quality of a flat monitor; just normal interviews.  We are still in the age of very poor 360 video quality, and this is no exception.  Channel 4 should be disappointed with this.  The content feels more like a student project than that of a well-established and (in some ways) ground-breaking terrestrial UK TV channel.","Jul 27, 2018 at 5:00 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 19:34:23.929282,MrRedDog,Slow to download/buffer,"There's something fundamentally wrong with their buffering or downloading. It's only using 1.5Mbs when downloading, when I've 40+Mbs to play with.

Taking an age to download just the 403Mb 'intro'.

I love C4 content, so hope they'll resolve it.","Jul 6, 2018 at 8:44 PM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 19:34:23.964188,Richsofts,Buffering,"Tried to stream the Promo (on a good fibre connection) buffering forever.
Downloaded the Promo and played, buffering forever.

Don't think it's accessing the downloaded content after downloading.

Early days! Hope they get this working!!","Jul 5, 2018 at 2:36 PM",1, 0,
