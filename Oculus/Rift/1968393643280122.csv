2022-05-28 18:08:40.305981,Krashload,Great content,This is a solid VR experience for the most part however a few jump cuts in the car are noticeable and can be annoying.,Sep 7 at 4:12 PM,4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:08:40.335901,Drax_1X,Decent content,Some good cinematography in the b-roll sceenes. But it was full of jump cuts and repeated the car roof gimmick and combined it with jump cuts. Jump cuts are immersion breaking edits; If you're trying to create a VR experience might want to figure out your camera work and edits a little better.,"Aug 24, 2020 at 9:06 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 18:08:40.353853,P3ndulum,Real,"Brilliant short vr documentary type of experience. The cinematography is fantastic as well as the locations shown, really makes you feel a little shiver coming over you.

2022-05-28 18:08:43.467525,Slick1984,Cannot Get This To Run,"I'm not heartbroken about this, as I'm not a fan. But, I work with a fan and wanted to show him. For some reason, this just spins and doesn't load the video or audio. To kill it, I have to open Task Manager and kill the multiple copies of it. All I get is a spinning white circle, that goes on and on. I don't know why it opens multiple copies of itself. Maybe that is why it doesn't run for me.

My general system specs are:
i7 9700K
32GB Ram
RTX 2080ti

This should run just about everything thrown at it. This is the first VR app that I have that doesn't work.

Maybe the devs have a solution. I'll let them have a crack at it.

***UPDATE*** - The Dev replied!... to the wrong name. Hey, thanks for being aware! I don't really care enough to bother ""gathering"" my PC info for this.","Sep 25, 2019 at 10:37 AM",1, 7,"Hi MadInfamous, thanks for letting us know about this.

2022-05-28 18:08:43.511408,inceptional,A genuinely quality 360 VR video,"The cinematography and stuff was really good, and it was also honestly interesting to listen to the conversation and watch the various scenes play out.

I just wish I was able to view these kinds of 360 videos in proper HD resolution, because the resolution is the one area where they just aren't at a high enough level right now to truly shine. But we'll get there in time.

Knowing the limitations of current-gen headsets though, this is really solid stuff.

It's free, so watch it and appreciate it for what it is.","Feb 22, 2019 at 10:56 AM",5, 21,
2022-05-28 18:08:43.526367,Contact,Ride with Eminem,"For the main Part your sitting in a Vehicle (Limo/Hummer) just listening to an Interview with Eminem telling tales about Detroit and how its always going to be Home for him..  Your also taken through memory lane with scenes of what the places he performed in growing up and growing his talent are looking like now. 

The only issue is with some of the quality of the Video taken from outside the vehicle.

That being said for a free, exclusive, intirmate interview from the perspective most never get to experience, it's a must for Eminem Fan's & Music Fans alike.","Mar 5, 2019 at 3:38 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:08:46.612114,FastLawyer,Felix & Paul are the gold standard in VR,"It just seems that with every new VR cinematic experience produced by Felix & Paul Studios, the quality just gets better & better. It really does feel like you're inches away from Marshall Matheres & Sway Calloway. This documentary is about 19 minutes long. Caleb Slain does a good job directing and just letting the focus be about Detroit. You see the grittiness in the people and in the city. I hope this is the future of filmmaking. I can't wait to see a real feature film in VR done in this style, hopefully, in the near future. Thank you Felix & Paul and thank you Oculus for bringing these free experiences to us. Makes me happy I chose Oculus over HTC Vive and if you're on Revive .... welcome to Oculus land.","Feb 22, 2019 at 4:56 AM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 18:08:46.642034,nbridges12,Only 20 Minutes But Worth Being Free,"This is a great free interview in VR with Marshall himself in an Escalade and he discusses the hardships he faced as a rapper in Detroit. I'm from metro Detroit and does a good job of showing what most of the areas of Detroit look like (they don't show the outskirts of the city for good reason, a lot of the homes are literally shells of homes with boarded up windows).  My only other problem is the quality being a little poor but if they shot this in 2017 it's understandable because VR has come a long way in just the past year! But overall, it's a short but great film and I would recommend visiting Detroit sometime!","Mar 20, 2019 at 4:21 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:08:49.767674,Hanabear,Powerful and Moving!,"It's a moving video for me, not only because I grow up in a similar city in China but also the special way the auther used to tell the story.

2022-05-28 18:08:49.797594,Eclipse8301,"Decent idea, but very boring","I guess I am the minority, being a big Eminem fab I was super hyped to try this out, unfortunetly it is very glitchy (transitions glitch out a lot) and the story/interview is just super boring. It was hard for me to sit through 20 min.

I did really like the idea behind this though.","Feb 24, 2019 at 5:14 AM",2, 1,
