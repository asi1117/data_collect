2022-05-28 20:06:00.386563,Glenn-Tidbury,Yet another broken vr game,"Just tried to play this on my oculus quest (1) via oculus link. Controls don't work. Right at the start it tries to go through them with you. I can walk (at the speed of light) by holding trigger and swinging my arms. I can turn using the right stick. It then asks you to use the left stick to teleport.... it doesn't work. Tried pushing, pulling, tapping, clicking.... teleport circle never appears. Can't progress any further as the game won't let me. Do not buy this game.",Jul 22 at 2:19 AM,1, 9,"Hi, thanks very much for trying out our game and apologies for not getting back to you sooner.

2022-05-28 20:06:00.402520,BlazixGames,Has lots of potential !,"For those Looking for genuine Reviews!!
As a youtube Gamer I can verify this game does work on Both the  Oculus Rift S And Quest 2 Both need to be connected to PC via ""Link Cable""  with an internet connection Inorder to connect to the mobile app.
 I managed to get the game working with a simple reboot / exiting and re-entering the oculus link Through The headset on The Quest 2. Which Fixed the movement issue when you first start, whichs happends due to a connection error.
MOBILE APP DOES WORK it is in the google playstore (Android) 
 Me and a good friend both played and tested the game. Which we will play on youtube, with the satisfaction on how well the game plays.

For The Developer :
 Keep up the good work you have something good here.
possible ideas/suggestions:
 Please adjust and or make flashlight a bit brighter and not have the lightbeam collide with objects which prevent you from seeing further ahead.

As a Gamer Id like to see more options for maps to play in.
Examples: Abandond School,playground,etc 
Graveyard/church for possible inside/outside experiences 
Abandomd hospital/Prision  
Whould be awesome to have more locations :D

If youd like to contact me my user name is my youtube. I plan to make a proper video for your game to justify what potential it holds and what it can be To truely Showcase your game the proper way which it deserves.
If you happen to like the video content you are more then welcome to use it as your game trailer / advertizment as you see fit.

Edit: would love to see a Quest 2 Version of this in the future for Portable play

2022-05-28 20:06:03.537172,ElusiveMarlin,"Needs more work, but looks promising","This looks like it could be really good, but I am unable to locate the Panic room app on the Google play store.  Searching for ""Panic Room"" brings up hundreds of options for other games in the genre.
Searching for Kuato Studios in Google play store brings up a list of your games, but nothing for Panic Room

Went to your website from my PC, and again, nothing about Panic Room.  
Please provide more information or make the app easier to find.

Thanks. 
**UPDATE:  I have found the app!, so will re-review shortly","Jan 7, 2021 at 2:17 AM",2, 11,"Hi there. There was an error in the previous version of Panic Room, which has now been fixed.

2022-05-28 20:06:03.553130,Griff.Toby.Dawg,App,"Where is the companion App? You'd think this would be something the game developer would provide a link to.
Looks a good game by what i could see standing outside the door, but thats all i can do until the app is available.
I see quite a few people complaining about ""knocking"" on the door, i couldn't get that far.","Jan 3, 2021 at 10:52 PM",1, 7,Hi there. Please search for 'Panic Room Companion App' on the App Store or Google Play.
2022-05-28 20:06:03.568090,TheGrandHoovie,"It works, and it's a lot of fun!","It works! My god is it fun. The scares are very well done, and the keys are hidden just well enough to promt searching for a bit. With two types of scares being in the game at the moment (Poltergiest and Slasher), this is kept fresh for a while. I can't wait for more to be added. My only complaint is that some of the cabinets can't be opened, and they keys can be difficult to pick up. Other than this, it lives up to what is promised. Well done devs!","Jan 10, 2021 at 11:57 PM",4, 6,"Hi there. There was an error in the previous version of Panic Room, which has now been fixed. We do apologise for the inconvenience.

2022-05-28 20:06:03.583050,3BEPb,Where can I download the phone part,Where can I download the phone part of the game? I have an Android phone. There is no such game in the store (,"Dec 23, 2020 at 12:27 PM",2, 40,
2022-05-28 20:06:03.600004,Wolfpack42,Nightmare inducing fun!,"Update:
The issues have been resolved and after playing a couple of rounds, I think it's safe to say that we have a winner! 
The cabin is well designed and I was creeped out just walking through the door during testing, when I knew nothing was going to jump out at me. 
I had a blast traumatizing my daughter by hitting the scares at the perfect times to make her jump. 
I highly recommend checking it out, especially with the price tag. I'd be more than happy to pay for additional content in the future. 
My only nitpick would be that with the multiple cameras/scares, it's a little difficult to see everything clearly on my phone, it was a lot easier with the tablet. I'd love to see a browser based app in order to control the scares from the PC. It's minor but may help with the immersiveness on the ""haunters"" end.  

As others have stated, I am unable to knock on the door. 
I'm using a Quest 2, connected through the link cable. Not sure if that makes a difference.","Jan 7, 2021 at 12:58 AM",5, 3,Great to hear that you're enjoying playing Panic Room!
2022-05-28 20:06:06.720816,Rockhardmonkey,Whats Going On?,"No reference to the app anywhere (google it i had to download through apkdownloader) then little to no direction on what to do next. i've seen reviews to ""knock on door"" i've tried everyway i could interpret that to no avail. I'm sad and confused instead of scared and entertained Please Fix!!

Update: Thank you Devs. the app is now in the google play app and i played it last night with the wife (she enjoyed scaring me lol) Fun game sufficient creepiness can't wait to see what more comes from this. I 2nd what others have said stating i would pay for DLC or Sequels!!","Jan 9, 2021 at 4:02 AM",4, 2,"Hi there. There was an error in the previous version of Panic Room, which has now been fixed.
