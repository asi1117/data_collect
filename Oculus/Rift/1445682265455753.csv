2022-05-28 19:17:19.961404,Chiara,Surprisingly intense!,"I thought this would be a very simple, relaxing game without much challenge. This could hardly be farther from the truth. Getting on the leaderboard is a grueling process of continuous panic and honing your visual search skills as you strive to slice a few seconds off your time. Highly addictive. My main frustration is that, in a game where visual search is so important, a few of the animations creep into my field of view and disrupt my flow. Additionally, I don't really understand how the metrics used on the leaderboards work - I just keep trying to win boards fast and see my score improve but I don't know what it means. If the metrics were somehow shown/explained during the game it might be clearer. The single environment can also get a bit monotonous. But it's more than worth the modest price.","Apr 2, 2017 at 3:01 PM",4, 5,
