2022-05-28 19:36:47.601542,nightcat.mau,Gluefoot The Wonder Horse,"UPDATE: As of 8/3/20 this game no longer responds to any controls. So, not even the demo is playble anymore. I tried the full game in pancake on Steam, and honestly? Both full versions should be free. 

Jockey of the year I am not. Not sure if other racing colors were luckier, but Gluefoot has to be the slowest horse in racing history. I hated having to give him a whack, then he got mad and stopped and smelled the track. He randomly would run at the rail, and it was honestly like riding an ornery real horsey. 

The game could use a better way to run as no matter how fast or slow I hit the A button or used the stingy speed booster, he just refused to go very fast. Again, just like a real horse, but it was frustrating. I liked the jockey's eye view and the jumping and timed trail, but having to apply the whip and the horse's lackluster speed didn't work for me.

The best part was him having a choice of running and I'm fairly sure he hit jumps because he felt like it. So it's real enough if you've ever trail ridden, but I can't say about track riding.","Aug 4, 2020 at 3:11 AM",1, 5,

Then my hubby bought me the game pad (Xbox) controller and saddle up! The secret is that the touch controllers do not work (at least they didn't for me) but the game pad is a whole 'nuter story! Lots of fun - going to purchase the whole game now. For five bucks, you can't go wrong!","Jan 7, 2019 at 10:49 PM",5, 1,

Yet to find a consistent controller reaction for anything EXCEPT QUIT.","Sep 15, 2018 at 1:23 AM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 19:36:50.793640,r8782b,It works just fine,Me and my kids have been playing it for 3 hrs and enjoy it very much.  Good demo will purchase the real game.

2022-05-28 19:36:50.824557,neuro27,Tap A Simulator,"And occasionally tap LB and RB. But seriously, this demo does not inspire one to get the full game when it comes out. The gameplay is very simplistic and not rewarding. When racing you can switch between a 3rd person view and the jockey's view which makes it VR, but other than that, there's nothing compelling about this demo that makes it worth trying. Suggestions for improvement: fix the UI (I noticed it slides out of view and angled when rounding corners); gameplay that goes beyond an internet flash game in complexity; a story/narrative element that makes you care about you as a jockey and the other competitors.","Jun 13, 2017 at 8:35 AM",2, 0,Thanks for your feedback.
