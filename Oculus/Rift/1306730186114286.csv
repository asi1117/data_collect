2022-05-28 19:46:11.896254,ClassicGamerNL,Without any options or even a menu,"Back in the days of the DK1 I played better games! This isn't a game, just a micro demo without any options or even a menu.","Sep 15, 2017 at 4:49 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:46:11.911214,Rockavik,Awesome idea but only a tech demo,"Im a big fan of traditional sword fencing and when i saw this i slammed down the take my money button. Graphics are awesome and shows alot of potential but sadly its let down by not being fleshed out into an actual game. Its only a tech demo if that, not worth paying money for. However i do see the potential if more characters, stages better physics and sword mechanics were added. With a little back story to the characters you could have a sort of virtual Mortal Kombat/street fighter sword fencing thing going. Make it so :-D","Jun 7, 2017 at 1:20 AM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 19:46:11.927172,caj001,"Awesome graphics, but not worth playing","Visually it's beautiful. But it seems more like a tech demo. You fight the captain over and over. There are no increasing challenges. There's only one environment. There's only the captain to fight. Sometimes the captain occupies your same space. After 5 minutes I was done. 

Give us more people to fight and more locations to fight in and it might become a more interesting game.","Jun 4, 2017 at 5:31 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 19:46:11.959086,WesleySnipers,"Great idea, please fix the collision","This was fun and looked great but it has a match breaking issue. I will gladly update my review after this character collision issue is fixed.

It would be great if you could better explain the health/status bar and adding with clear victory and loss at the end of a match.

Please consider adding more great animations, environments and hopefully score/stats.","Jun 4, 2017 at 4:16 PM",2, 3,
