We will continue to improve the core experience and soon will start working on the campaign mode for the game as well as adding new mechanics, puzzles and story elements."

Its implicated the third person camera fairly well but when in first person mode its nearly impossible to controll the ""player"" I dont know whether if its my head controlling where he goes or my hands or even both at the same time needless to say the game is almost unplayable in first person, but third person is fine.  Also I had issues with the ""player""s body freaking out sometimes causing me to be unable to use weapons correctly (especially guns).  I know the game is in early access but I feel that these problems should have been fixed in development.  But once those things are fixed I would highly reccomend this game, the third person camera changes everything about how you play, and the experience.  I hope this review helps.","Oct 30, 2019 at 10:36 AM",3, 16,"Hey SlippyMcBacon

Thank you for your rating and the review, we just pushed a new updated where we completely overhauled the first person locomotion and made many improvements to the camera system amongst other improvements.

I hope you can give it another try and give us your feedback.

If you want to get in direct contact with us, just join our discord (you can find it on our website), we actively look for feedback and ideas on what we will add next to the game."

Also, my son fell through the ground in a couple spots.  Good concept!","Dec 8, 2019 at 7:45 AM",4, 5,"Thanks DrawnOut for your review. We released an update last Friday with a lot of bug fixes and improvements. We also created a completely new Tutorial with little task rooms. The hands in first person will be improved very soon.

We will also add less combat focused experiences in the next update."

I expected a new strange immersion like the rubber hand illusion when the miniature character and myself synced.
But we weren't that exactly synced, there was time lag (or my move was not traced through the end).
The character doesn't have his face, and so you cannot see if the head twists or leans as you do.","Nov 11, 2019 at 10:07 PM",3, 3,
