2022-05-28 18:30:02.012392,Allerka,Doesn't work on Quest 2,"When I fire it up, once I get to the menu, it doesn't seem to detect my Touch controllers at all, and I can't interact with the game at all. Trying to hit buttons on my keyboard or mouse doesn't work either. And on top of that, this game is ugly as frak. Looks like something originally made for the PS-2. I get it's a couple years old now, but I can buy better-looking pre-made assets off the Unity store for almost nothing. In fact I have.

Really glad this thing was free, otherwise I'd be annoyed. Not even going to waste my time trying to get it to work, uninstalling it.","Jun 27, 2021 at 6:38 AM",1, 27,

No other game that I play in VR causes me issues but this one makes me ill almost instantly.

Here's what Radial-G is: sluggish, monochromatic, boring tracks, easy levels with no real desire to play again until you get it perfect. 

When you turn it just kind of lumbers in the direction. No real split second thinking and timing. 

The graphics are pretty terrible, all things considered. 

I can't recommend this when there are so many great options out there.","Dec 27, 2018 at 10:05 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 18:30:11.483061,PreCon,Still Doesn't Work with Touch,"I purchased this while at work, and was looking forward to getting home and trying it out. Unfortunately as other reviews have stated it still doesn't work with touch.

2022-05-28 18:30:11.498021,petelozzi,Unpolished but good fun!,"This game is fun.  There are some problems with execution related to porting I think...  

It reminds me of the 3DO era, specifically a game called, ""Crash n Burn"" where like Radial G I had a great time despite the obvious flaws...

Despite what you've read in other reviews, I can assure you touch controllers are supported, kinda.  My hope is that there will be an update soon...  You see, the touch controllers aren't supported in the menus, so you have to lift off your Rift to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to explore the menus, then once it's go time you have to put the Rift back on.  There is no way to know ""what does what"" on the touch controls so you just have to figure it out.  A major flaw is that the devs seem to have been so happy that they got it working that they didn't put much thought into the mapping of the buttons.  For instance, to fire your weapon you have to take your thumb off the stick that STEERS YOUR CRAFT.  So in a game where split second decisions are critical, you have to stop steering long enough to fire then quickly go back and hope to course correct.  FIXXXXXXX ITTTTTTT!

There are lots of redeeming qualities though!  Definitely some throwback charm of like F-Zero and ""Crash n Burn"".  There's some FAST action and some great visuals.  I like it, but why U NO FIX PROBLEMS?  Looking forward to some polish!","May 10, 2018 at 1:41 PM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 18:30:11.512981,AwkMan,Excellent racing game (Touch control)!,"This is a very good futuristic racing game! The addition of circular tracks is awesome. This allows 360º rotation, jumps, and gravity flips, perfectly fitted into the game, and with no motion sickness! It also has weapons for attacking other racers (but it lacks a tutorials explaining what each weapon does, you need to discover it by testing them one by one).
I was a bit dubitative to buy it due to people complaining that Touch controller were not working, but in my case they worked flawlessly (and also I changed the controller layout of touch and the configuration was saved even after closing and reopening the game). In my case I have never had any other gamepad connected to the PC except for touch, so maybe having a controller connected to the PC makes the game not work with Touch","Mar 19, 2018 at 12:38 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:30:14.656573,RuneSR2,Awesome racing game - a must have!,"Awesome racing game, and worked perfectly using Touch - but you can also use a gamepad.

I enjoyed the game so much I felt bad about not paying for it - so I just bought the game on Steam but don't plan to ever install it, it was just 10 bucks.
The game feels slightly like Polybius, WipeOut and maybe some Trailblazer.

The game performed great with super-sampling (SS) at 2.0 and graphics on medium on my overclocked GTX 1080, 16GB PC3200 and i7 7700K, I did not notice any frame dropping (I'm just guessing, graphics on high seemed just to activate anti-aliasing and you don't need that with SS 2.0, so with SS 2.0 I didn't notice any difference between medium and high except some frame dropping using high).","Jun 21, 2021 at 11:05 PM",5, 6,"Hi there, the game used to support Touch gamepad emulation without issue, we are looking into what's gone wrong.

But advertising Touch support while there's no Touch setting nor recognition?
I mean WTF is this? Buttons and sticks, the full Touch controls are DEAD and there's no settings in the controls menu?

Come on people, fix this or imma have to get a refund because keyboard controls in VR is for noobs...","Mar 16, 2018 at 5:07 AM",3, 3,"Hi there, the game used to support Touch gamepad emulation without issue, we are looking into what's gone wrong.

I can Play on my Xbox controller and on the Oculus Touch. If this Game had any ciontroller issues in the past than they are gone by now. I bought it Today the 06.03.2018 played it for 3 hours straight and love it :D 

does the game make false advertisment? No! you get what you expect it makes the racing in a galaxy far far away look like Kindergarden.

good work and well spend 9.99 Euros.","Mar 6, 2018 at 5:29 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:30:14.701453,LuluViBritannia,Awesome game!,"Radial-G is great!
First, the graphics are stunning, and it stands out even more in VR (as usual). Besides, the environment is dense and dynamic!
The game really feels like F-Zero : it's a race game with a sci-fi atmosphere!
I don't really like the steam-punk music, luckily the options allow you to cancel it : I use Itunes to play my own music while I play this game.

As a race game, it may not be the best : it's kind of linear as the vehicle mostly follows the road by itself. That said, it is still quite technical : you have to use your knowledge of relative speed to avoid the ""red doors"" (which gives you damage if you pass them), and you can also transform your Shield (basically, this is your HP) in Speed, and many weapons can be used to attack the other competitors!
Besides, it really gives great sensations of speed, and overall, it's super immersive!

In terms of content, it's not bad for a VR game, though we could argue it's still not quite enough. 9 races, about as much weapons, and as much vehicles, and the many modes all consist of the same thing : being first to finish the race.

Despite this, personally, it's among my favourite games in VR. I just wish there were more people to play with (I tried Multiplayer several times, and I always wound up alone xD!).","Oct 7, 2017 at 11:56 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:30:14.716413,EQuinnoXX,Disappointed,"I rarely review games, but this sucks. Despite what it may say, this title does not seem compatable at all with Touch. The most I could get it to do was spin the ship on the first menu screen that shows up. So I broke down and used the XBO controller for the first time (My feeling is that if it's not Touch compatible, it's probably not worth playing in VR because the immersiveness is gone). 
The game isn't really very fun, it's just irritating. The tutorial videos are so fast that you don't even have time to read them before it's on to the next random video. A woman is constantly yelling ""WARNING!"" in my ear... why? No idea. Low shields or something. It would have been a better idea to have her yell what the warning actually was for. The vehicle dashboard is a mess of who-knows what. None of it is labeled and it isn't obvious what any of it is. Everything going on in front of you is so busy anyways that you don't have time to glance down. A HUD would have been a much better idea so you don't have to look down. 
The track seems to like to throw you off of it and there is no obvious way to land correctly. So you die. Again and again. But, suprisingly, you still make it to the finish line and remember it was a race, not just a gauntlet... and all I can think of is that I came in second place after dying multiple times during the race. Second place. Playing that horribly in any other racing game would send you to last place. Just how bad is the AI on the NPC's if that warrants second place?!

I've only played four races and I honestly could care less if I played it again. The developers seriously need to go play Nitrous Oxide for the Playstation 1 because that game did this better in almost every way.  Ugh. I really hope there are plans to update this game because it feels unfinished, rushed and almost soul-less.","Jun 21, 2017 at 2:10 PM",2, 6,

As a side note, I didn't experience any motion sickness with this whatsoever, although I am for the most part immune to that. Still, I sorta expected my stomach to get a little unsettled with super highspeed spinny racing and I was perfectly fine!","May 1, 2017 at 6:40 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 18:30:21.023543,MetalThrashingMadman,"Seems cool at first, but gets old fast","While this game gives you a good sense of speed, it fails at everything else. The core to this game's problems is the tracks. Not only do they all look the same, they all feel the same. Thanks to most of the tracks being made of a tube that you ride the outside of, you are almost never challenged. It changes up on occasion, but you spend most of your time on these tubes that take NO SKILL to navigate. You can simply not steer when these tubes curve and you will just follow the track. You probably won't be on the best side of the track after the turn, but it doesn't change the fact this game requires no cornering skills at all. The only things you really have to worry about are barriers you can run into, easy to dodge btw, and the rare moments where you can fall off the track. One of the greatest things about a good racer is learning the ins and outs of the tracks and mastering them. These tracks are so easy to master that they all feel like the same track which ends the fun way too quickly. If the devs bothered to at least make different looking settings (all the tracks are in space, so there is no terrain, buildings, etc, just a boring sky box with stars and maybe some asteroids), then I would at least have something to look forward to every time I unlocked a track.

The bottom line is don't get this game unless it's for $5 or less, and even then I have a hard time recommending it.","Jan 3, 2017 at 3:09 AM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 18:30:21.038504,Toboshi,No depth,"The tracks are largely uninteresting, the combat is unispired, and even though you're moving fast, you don't really feel it.  It's fun for a few hours if you're new to racing games, but otherwise it simply feels empty. You feel like you're alone on the track once the pack widens.

It's not that bad a game, it just feels like every aspect of it never quite got to where it wanted to be. Not worth the price.","Dec 30, 2016 at 10:05 AM",2, 1,

gotta go fast?
dont get motion sick?

then welcome to one of the most exillerating titles in VR to date. this is one of the more unique racing titles ive come across in my time. instead of your typical race track, you have a pipeline that you cruise, blast, launch and jump across at such breakneck speeds even a vet like myself gets a bit woozy from the sharp turns. see you on the line!","Nov 17, 2016 at 9:39 PM",5, 6,

Because I do, and my dream for VR was a game which filled that same role.
Let me tell you, THIS GAME DOES.
The intense high-speed twitch-reflex style racing is exactly what I was hoping for!
The tracks are incredibly fun; racing on a cylindrical track with the awesome G-force physics make the game tricky to master and incredibly satisfying.
I couldn't reccomend this game enough!
It would be cool to get more tracks, but the provided ones (9 of them) are tons of fun.
