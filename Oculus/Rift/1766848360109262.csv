2022-05-28 18:40:29.609304,loupfu,Awesomely immersive !,"To date, one of the best looking games so far !
Very polished in many aspect, graphics (with gorgeous light effects), sound effects, musics, all is great !
The gameplay itself is fantastic ! The way you move with the kayak is extremely well done, pretty realistic. The stealth ops side is well transcribed, and gunplay is precise and satisfaying !
The campaign is good enough with some cool stuffs to unlock !
The cross-buy and ""cross-profile-backup"" is very appreciated !

Bravo to the devs !!",Feb 14 at 9:15 AM,5, 12,

2022-05-28 18:40:29.654184,jlstaude,A common non-free world game.,"It is almost a ""shoot the duck"" game. The kayak physics is not great. Graphics are good, but nothing ""Wow"". The game plot is basic, trending to ""this makes no sense"".   

This is not a free-world game. The story is lineal, and the path you follow is also lineal. The NPC's intelligence is really low.  

The stealthiness is bad. As long as you are ""hidden"" according to your rada, you are hidden (even thouh most part of the kayak is exposed.


Don't buy this. Don't throw your money.  I whish I had a refund.",Dec 9 at 2:25 AM,1, 55,"Thank you for providing feedback about your experience. It's disappointing to read that you found the stealth, movement mechanics, and tone within the game lacking, as these are often noted amongst the title's core strengths amongst players and critics. We hope you find a game more suited to you soon."
2022-05-28 18:40:29.669144,data_dave,The name says it all - great game!,"TL;DR – Buy the game if you like lurking in the shadows.  Great story – great immersion – great acting – great music.  And, there is enough post-story fun to keep you coming back to it. SMASH the buy button – you'll have fun.

I grew up kayaking in the reeds on my lake with my friends and playing covert ops spying on snapping turtles, ducks, people washing boats, and yes the occasional pretty swimmer. I'll say the game is pretty real from the kayaking POV – it's true that you can sneak up on people way closer than you think.  It's amazing what you can do when you're quite and they're distracted. 

The immersion is really amazing in this game as you forget your sitting on your chair.   Your body actually believes you are on the water -- you can almost feel the reeds brushing your body.

This game impressed me with it's attention to detail.  The way you can speed into the reeds and they slow you to a stop, the sound of the paddle, speed paddling vs. creeping, the character reactions, even the occasional mosquito that buzzes by your ear.

You are supposed to be stealth, but you can do whatever you want in the game.  If you get too crazy with shooting, you'll end up dying because you are literally a  sitting duck. And, there is a point in the game where characters start wearing armor – no more head-shot kills.

The story was surprisingly interesting as they kept twisting it so that you weren't really sure who you were working for anymore – or who were the bad guys.  After the story, there is free play and challenges so the designers really thought about this as a long term skill game.

Quick observation: There is no kayaker that would put paddle on the side holder while in-boat. Always rest with the paddle across your lap. In a kayak, the primary thing you're constantly wrestling with is balance.  If you flip, you need that paddle in your hands to right yourself or drown.  Not a breaker - it's just not real.

Overall, though, the game is amazing!! Thanks for making!",Nov 22 at 1:30 AM,5, 51,

Even though the game didn't look good on the quest, the performance is good, the story is pretty solid but I haven't finished it yet.
It's important to know that your arms do get tired after paddling for a while.

Well...After playing the third level about 19 times...I realized that it was completely inconsistant. Sometimes the spotlight would shine right on me and I would not be noticed....and sometimes it would be 30 feet away, and they would see me...?!

Pros
Good graphics
Pretty long story (took me like 3 hours to finish) 
Good story (and there are secret audio logs)
Good level replayability

Cons
 (IMPORTANT PLEASE FIX) When I tried to grab the C4, I would grab the detonator instead and the other way around. Maybe put the detonator on the right side of your lap?

The whole thing feels very Splinter Cell-esque and is well done.
I've always enjoyed the stealth games like Splinter Cell, the Thief series, etc.

The graphics are very good, the sound and environment is immersive. The kayak controls are very good (but not perfect). I would give it 4.5 stars if I could for the weird rifle scope use, but that could just be VR two-handed weapon use in general.

2022-05-28 18:40:39.175717,KingDGB,Fun Game,"So, I was following this game before it came out, and purchased on release. I some of the first mission, found it kind of boring and put it aside. 

Over the last couple years, I've built up quite a few VR games in my library and I noticed many of them I had barely played, or never played at all. I realized that I had trouble getting over the ""VR fog"". I would put the headset on for maybe an hour max, and the first thing that tires me out or goes wrong I pretty much turn it off and do something else.

I decided to stop doing this and try and actually get into these longer experiences. Each day I've put a few hours into VR, Asgard's Wrath, Saints and Sinners, and today I was feeling extra lazy and decided to play some Phantom again. 

****Here's the review***

Phantoms graphics are not good at all. They are some of the worst graphics I've seen in VR even at 1.5 SS and Ultra everything. This was my initial turn off to the game. Toward the end of the first mission, things start to get a little more interesting. After completeing the 2nd mission, I was hooked. 

Once you get the actual kayak movement down, it feels great. Weapons feel good, and I use them quite a bit even though your score goes down because it's just more fun. There's almost always a couple different ways to go which is nice, and I was impressed by the ""bosses"" in the game. 

I've given this 4 stars for a couple reasons. The graphics are bad, I mentioned that, and that takes away a lot in VR, which already has poor graphics. The game is somewhat short and generic. I took a point for these two reasons. That being said, this game is good and you should play it. There aren't many 5 hour + experiences that keep it fresh in VR, so this one is worth it.

2022-05-28 18:40:42.293378,coffeeguy66,Fun VR For Your Money,"I've been looking at this for a few weeks now and due to the mixed reviews was on the fence about buying it. Youtube videos look good but I still couldn't decide. 

I don't know why I bother going by reviews to be honest, one man's meat is another man's poison and just because others don't like it doesn't mean I wont. For £23 , it's worth a punt and it helps the developers improve their titles and to keep on giving us pretty decent games such as this.

I'm playing this with my Oculus Quest 2 wirelessly, my graphics card is a Nvidia RTX 2060 , got the video settings maxed out in the game and it is only slightly blurry in places but overall graphically not bad at all. Good sound and atmosphere, the boat paddle control is a cynch and very intuitive and the gun firing, aiming and reloading are all very good and pretty precise. As others have said it would be nice to be a bit more involved where the reload of the weapon is concerned to give you that bit more of a immersive experience but this in my opinion is nit-picking.

I'm really enjoying this and I think there will be some replay value as you can go in and play in stealth mode or all guns blazing and then give it another go in a different way. I played about 45 mins right off the bat and got no arm ache at all. I'm certainly no athlete either .

2022-05-28 18:40:42.353219,Salyder,Novel Idea but not a very fun one,"I think this kind of gameplay loop would be fun for like one mission where you control a kayak.  It controls how you'd expect a kayak to control but it being a kayak, it's hard to control and not very fun.  Moving your arms gets tiresome and you'll end up spamming quick small circle motions, similar to how you'd waggle a wiimote instead of using full swings.  It's almost like the devs realized that the main control was tiring so put this 'hack' into it?

Now moving a cumbersome kayak around is one thing but when you are trying to be stealthy can lead to frustration.  That and the gameplay loop itself isn't very fun.  I don't really like waiting around in reeds for enemies to move away.  Shooting guys isn't recommended and doesnt feel super great anyway.  The visuals aren't very good either.  Muddy wall textures everywhere even with high settings.  The environment itself doesn't look very good either.

This could be a fun segment in a call of duty style game but as an entire game it's just well, not very fun to control and the gameplay loop isn't deep enough.  I'd say try it for 10 bucks on sale to see if it's your cup of tea.","Oct 28, 2020 at 12:03 AM",3, 38,

For the plot it seems instead to replay some of the best parts of Metal Gear Solid. Phantom Covert Ops is practically a perfect mix of the best that the major stealth games have been able to give us so far but in VR.

I can firmly say that if Splinter Cell and Metal Gear are the excellence of stealth games on PC and PlayStation respectively, Phantom Covert Ops is the perfect exponent of stealth in VR.","Aug 22, 2020 at 6:35 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:40:48.720189,ricogs400,Thank God I brought my kayak,"Everything in the game works great.  Graphics are excellent and the nighttime setting hides a lot of the little graphical issues of close up VR views.   The movement feels spot on for rowing and turning.  The layout of your inventory in the kayak feels good.  Everything is in a good position to grab when you need it.  This is medium to high on the motion sickness chart due to the twisting and turning of the kayak.  I am medium  for tolerance and could feel a few times where my brain was warning me, but nothing so strong that I had to stop.  Do almost an hour at a time and feel pretty good afterwards.
Now, the stealth gameplay really fits this style of movement in a strange, but great way.  You can slowly creep around, paddling slowly, then pick it up when you want to ""sprint"" to cover.  The levels are laid out nicely to have you wandering what's around the next bend.  Gotta say, arms are kinda tired.

DEVEPLOPERS pleases contact me for more information.  This is easily fixed.   I've got over 1000hrs in Pavlov, Onward, etc.  Don't get sick easily, but this game made me very sick.  DON'T ROTATE the CAMERA, this is known to cause motion sickness.  Easily fixed by developer if they gave us an option when paddling/turning rotated the cannon, but not the camera.  I can handle the snap turning, but normal paddling to turn even a little bit is sickening due to the camera (view) rotating.   If normal paddling just rotated the cannon, but not the camera, the player would naturally turn around in there seat to rotate, motion sickness solved.  Check Wardust & Standout, in these games I can drive at high speed with no sickness because they use this method.  BTW, your 'comfort' blinkers do NOT work.  I've tried every setting.

After playing games like pavlov, onward, contractors, gun club and many other VR shooters, the gun play feels very rough and extremely artificial.

Regarding the game: I like it however as a kayakker I am missing some handling that easily could have been implemented into the game. Rolling to hide from a searchlight, moving sideways by either sculling or pulling one paddle and more important steering by carving. Paddling with one arm (just minor movement to get a better view or shot). I do not know if they consulted a kayakker but doesn't seem they did. That's a pity.","Jun 29, 2020 at 5:11 AM",4, 10,

The game offers stealth and direct action modes...I prefer the stealth. Though, sometimes it is fun to just start blazing and see what happens and then replay the part for a better ranking. I hope this is the first game of many from this ""franchise""...if it becomes one. Phantom was (is) a lot of fun to play.","Aug 12, 2020 at 12:04 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:40:55.030312,djlegacy2k5,Amazing!,"This game plays amazingly! The paddle control is smooth and works better than other games that use the same control style. The AI is solid enough. You can play casual or have a tough challenge. The atmosphere is great and had me swatting around my head when a bug would supposedly fly up to my ear thanks to great sound design. There are extra challemges and things to do for replayability. The only thing I had an slight issues with was the goggles, guns, etc were a bit floaty and didnt appear to have any weight so your arms would kind of float around a bit when pulling out a weapon to aim or looking through goggles and returning them to your storage. Other than that tiny bit of slightly odd feeling animation, the rest of the game plays and looks as close to AAA as you can get. Everyome should own this game!","Jun 26, 2020 at 11:14 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:40:55.046269,Masamune5454,I was wrong its good. slow mo seems bugy,"i was skeptical about the whole kyak idea, but they pulled it off great. it feels like a full legit game, with great hand interactions and stuff. i do wish i could zoom, with the binoculars and the rifle scope. the rifle barely zooms at all.
also i wish that i could pull my magazine out to check it, or at least pull the old one out to put in a new one. right now the ammo counter is on the guns, and.you slap a mag in from your satchel, like blood and truths car segments, but its limited. 
also you dont really get to rack the weapons....

all in all its great. level design is top notch. even in a kyak, the areas feel open and like there are some thought going into the tunnels and overall architecture. its great and i would like to see more like this.

Con's, i would say theres some issues but not many. there is a issue with dropping items. most items lock to your hand, which im not a fan of in general, but i get it. but when putting new ammo or gear in your pouches, it lags and looks janky. half the time im not sure if it went in or if it fell through the kyak, becuase there also is no physical prescense, other than with interactables or such.  
also theres not enough chances to use the cool gadgets so far, maybe chapter 5 is still early, but i thought it was close to the end.  theres not a whole lot to bad talk here though, the games pretty straightforward with what it does. it feels great when you kyak like a boss.

biggest issue i have is the slow mo never triggers correctly, making some what would be very cool metal gear solid moments void, and sometimes lead to a early death. maybe this is the stealth systems fualt, but i also wish you had a adreneline meter and could use slow mo at any time. thats the main reason i deduct a star.","Jun 28, 2020 at 1:15 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:40:58.131019,oneiros5321,Good but way too short,"The game and its mechanics are very solid.
It takes a few minutes to be comfortable with the control of the canoe but it quickly becomes very intuitive, and for what it lasts, the game is very good from beginning to end.

But when I say ""for what it lasts"" is the reason I gave it only 3 stars.
It ends way too soon and at the end, I felt like it was going to continue on another chapter...after all, I just did 1 mission in 1 environment so it would be normal that the game continue on a brief to another mission, right?

Except, no. It just ends there...feels like playing the first chapter of a game and then, credits roll, and you ask yourself where are the other 2 chapters?

If the game was longer and also not as easy (it's extremely easy...which is also why I really though there was more to it) it would've been an easy 5.
But as is, it just feels like the game isn't complete...more like a lengthy demo of a game. I even have to come back here to see if I didn't miss the mention ""early access"".

Hopefully some more content will eventually come to fill the void.","Jun 28, 2020 at 6:59 AM",3, 6,

The game is the same concept over and over. You sit in a Kayak and paddle in circles (Seated Mode ONLY).  If you shoot someone you lose points. The graphics are poor.  Their is no originality in this game, you repeat the same thing over and over.

 It is very hard to use the sniper rifle.  After you  complete the first first minutes you have played the entire game as it simply repeats. Overall worth maybe $10.","Jul 1, 2020 at 7:19 PM",3, 4,

ideas:

*make it so you can stand and lean back in your kayak for easier shots
*add a sniper elite style weapon system where you choose your sniper, smg, and pistol

2022-05-28 18:41:01.316498,Bangieboy,Solid Stealth Game,"First the gripes. Bought on Friday, finished by Saturday, approx 4 hours to complete campaign then done. Some Rift textures could be better. One soldier detected me through a pillar and shot me (through the pillar) and I couldn't shoot them back, not good enough on a full price game. Using the scope is poorly done and awkward, compared with say, Zero Caliber or Pavlov. Now the pros, VR stealth done right, and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as MGS. Atmospheric too, the shining torches, reeds and splashing water is immersive. What there is of the short campaign is done well, and I cannot fault the story or voice acting. Controlling the kayak is easy to get into and feels intuative. Spending the entire game afloat also works. Explosions are immense making you want to blow stuff up rather than stay quiet. The Quest version is surprisingly good, with some areas rivalling Rift graphically. Cross buy is always welcome and generous on the part of the developer. All in all, not a AAA title but a solid 4 star title and an enjoyable stealth game done right, but with minor niggles which will hopefully be ironed out in due course.","Jun 30, 2020 at 6:32 AM",4, 3,

The extra five gb made all the difference for me with the amazing detail added to the pc version where this game truly shines making me feel totally immersed, I felt like I was actually there.

 As it's a seated game I will continue playing on the pc with the oculus link as the detail is so much better.

To the developers:
Thank you for an amazing game as it is right now, however the game has great potential for a unique online co-op with a double seated kayak or a group of kayaks set against each other in a pvp or simply taking out terrorists/zombies or avoiding them or all of the above options put together lol!

2022-05-28 18:41:07.634600,RuneSR2,"Totally ""Sam Fischer Style"" kayaking","The performance is great. I'm forcing CV1 ss 2.0 (oc'ed 1080), and although I get dips below 90 with High details, the game runs really close to 90 fps. 
Textures might not be Alyx quality, but you do not notice that using the CV1. Love that you got arms and a body - you don't get that in Alyx ;) Weapons look awesome. 
The game supports temporal antialiasing as the highest/best level of antialiasing - this usually means that the game was designed for Oculus oled hmds, because temporal antialiasing looks really blurry with lcd hmds, but there are other non-temporal options available.
When selecting High detail settings, you do not get the highest available settings, because dynamic shadows can be increased another notch. Doing that did have a significant performance impact on my rig - but it looked really great. You may need at least a 1080 Ti or better to max out the game using CV1 and ss 2.0.
Paddling felt real - I do understand if some may experience motion sickness, but there are some aids and lower difficulty levels for persons new to VR.

Everything about this game was so well done. I completed it on PC and then, after noticing it was cross-play, I played throug the first few levels on Quest. The graphics are noticably better on PC, but still very impressive on Quest, considering the hardware differences. I would 100% recommend this on either platform. It also has cloud saves, so you can go back and forth between the Quest and PC, as needed. I could not be more impressed with this game. Easily a 5-star experience. I'm already looking forward to a sequel or DLCs. Honestly, a fishing game or basic exploration game, using this games kayaking mechanics, would be pretty cool, too.","Jul 3, 2020 at 3:05 AM",5, 1,

the Controls are mostly fine but the fast turn feature was confusing, feels like it needs inverting... 

Whilst there are 7x Campaign Levels, dont be fooled into thinking that they are vast areas or all different, in fact the arena is tiny and you repeat the same path/routes over and over...

In addition to the campaign mode, there are freeplay modes and extra challenges that make up for the lack of campaign but these addon extras are 57% of the entire experience.","Jul 6, 2020 at 4:08 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 18:41:10.881915,Daz_J,Very good unique stealth experience.,"The Kayak is alot of fun to cruise around in.  I was hoping for more accurate water simulation but this does strike a nice balance between realism and arcade.  Everything looks pretty good in the CV1 RIft especially the water reflections and lighting.  It is a bit rough around some edges like the patrol boats that have very stiff movement and don't move like boats in water should.  Also the volume of a big splash is not much louder then when you're going slow so its hard to tell how much noise you're making.  The sound for everything else is excellent.  When someone speaks, you know exactly where they are.

The campaign is of decent length.  The first run through could take anywhere from 6-10 hours, it took me about 8.  There's a freeplay mode to go back and use alternate paths as well as a challenge mode so there's a decent amount of content.  

It is very much enjoyable.  I think it would be near perfect if it had more realistic water or varied enviroments.  I would love to see the Devs stick with this and give it some more love or even make a side game thats just adventure kayaking down raging rivers.","Jun 28, 2020 at 5:05 PM",4, 1,
