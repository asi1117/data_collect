2022-05-28 20:00:50.332423,dodgymuffins,Great for a free program but...,"There's no autosave or file-recovery feature. As such I've lost hours of work (on more than one occasion!) because it crashed and - I guess like an idiot - I forgot to periodically save my creations. I mean it's great that I was so engrossed into the immersive creative process forgetting I was interacting with a piece of software that the idea of breaking my flow to save never entered my head. Other than that, it's great - especially for something free. But I'm feeling rather salty about jumping back into it after basically wasting the last 2 hours of creativity ><",Aug 20 at 9:27 AM,4, 20,"Sorry for the late response. There is an autosave feature; see https://docs.openbrush.app/user-guide/accessing-autosave-files for more details. If it's not working, we'd love to hear about it on our discord; https://discord.com/invite/W7NCEYnEfy"

2022-05-28 20:00:50.362343,LillyPoof,easy peasy,"It's super easy to use and learn. Only took me a few minutes to figure out how create a wooden textured table. However I do wish there was a more precise eraser tool for more detailed work.
   
       I like using the diamond tool to create shapes and guides then drawing around it to create what i want. I was not fond of the guide tool provided in the advanced mode. The advanced mode guide tool disapears within as you draw making it frustrating to use.  The grey color of the tool almost blends in with the environment making it harder to see.

         These issues make it a 4 star for me. I'll redo the review if i figure out a way around these or it is updated.",Oct 13 at 10:33 PM,4, 0,
