2022-05-28 20:15:48.638081,Slick1984,Timed instead of outs?,"The graphics are good, not spectacular. I have a RTX2080ti, let me use it! 

The game is timed instead of number of outs and innings. A lot of time is wasted during the celebration of hitting a homerun. Stop the clock during the celebrations. 

If you have limited space like I do, you are nearly on the plate. There should be an adjustment option to push the plate away. This is the 2nd Baseball type game that I have purchased and they both are similar in this regard. I refunded the other one.

The pitches are slow in the ""Normal"" version and I guess that was alright. But, I switched over to the ""Pro"" version and the pitches were not that much faster. They need to be faster. ""Normal"" version, guessing about 70mph. ""Pro"" version, guessing about 75mph. I'd like to see some heat!

There is a ""Gold Ball"" as the last pitch, after time expires. It seems to always be low, so get out your golf clubs. 

If you don't swing at what you might think is a ball, it counts as a miss.

This could be much better. The graphics quality needs to be improved for the machines that can handle it. It says that an i7 4770 is suggested with a 1080 or better GPU.  It did run smoothly for my i7 9700k with the previously mentioned GPU.

The four Major League Parks feel fake. It just didn't feel immersive to me. I might refund this one, too.

Where are the iconic Ballparks? Wrigley Field, Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park. Instead we get where the Marlins play.","May 3, 2020 at 2:30 AM",3, 59,
