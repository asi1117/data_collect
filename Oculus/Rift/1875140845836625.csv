2022-05-28 18:42:52.564949,FastLawyer,Nice VR story experience for kids,"The graphics are not the best. The story would probably be more enjoyable for kids.  There are no interactions. The voice acting was the best thing about this experience. Whole thing is about 6-7 minutes long. Not something I would show off to friends or family, but not bad.","Apr 27, 2018 at 12:28 PM",3, 4,
