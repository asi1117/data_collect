2022-05-28 21:02:44.257168,SullyOnDrums,This should not have been released,"First off, I've a Ryzen 7 3700 8 core with 64G Ram.  Every other title has performed flawlessly.

Beginning at the starting menu screen, the evnironment was very jumpy as I looked around.  This persisted through some parts of game play as well.  
Controls were laggy, or non responsive.  I would try to turn and the action would happen 2-3 seconds after the input.  Moving forward was problematic as I was unable to do so AT ALL for periods of up to 10 seconds.

Then the game itself.  I spent 20 minutes (when not fighting with the controls) trapped in a burning warehouse as no doors would open, there were no ladders to climb, and no way to do survival type things like climb over an obstacle that was waist high, or remove an object like a chair.

Very disappointing.",Apr 6 at 8:45 PM,1, 34,Most users are not experiencing this issue. Please contact us at support@fivefingerstudios.com or for a quicker response in Discord (https://discord.gg/g7vYGudHF3) and we can work with you on resolving them.
2022-05-28 21:02:44.271131,rajtkd66,Extremely and pleasantly surprised,"I enjoyed playing this game very much. I love FPS, and this really delivered with impressive gun mechanics and variety of weapons. It’s story driven, which is really hard to find these days. It had substance, which I didn’t expect from a 2 man team. The lighting and sounds in the environments, graphics and puzzles were really great.

I didn’t experience issues with launching the game, I have a Quest 2 and using Air Link. With Air Link it’s a little jumpy for a few seconds, but then it’s ok and the game plays smoothly. With Virtual Desktop and Link cable it’s completely smooth the whole time. All in all, it’s a great game.",Apr 18 at 9:29 AM,5, 11,
2022-05-28 21:02:44.286091,PrinceOfPersia,"Some Technical Issues, otherwise great","I like what i have played in the first ten minutes and both suprised and not suprised this is made by 2 people. great level of interactivity loved putting the fires out. the airlink stuttering when levels load is very jarring and it also stutters when rotating, however game works flawlessly after a couple of seconds. I would like to suggest subtitles if possible, and two handing the pistol. once the issue of stutters have been addressed, i will change my review to 5 stars. For the budget and price iam already impressed and i hope you can add to this game within a reasonable time frame.  you have a solid product just polish it up.",Apr 27 at 11:32 PM,3, 3,
2022-05-28 21:02:44.300053,Quest787,A VR treat,"This game is fantastic—a well-paced mix of exploration, combat and intuitive puzzles that jell to create a memorable gaming experience. As for the environments, I’ve been waiting since I got my first headset in 2016 to visit locations that nail the feel and atmosphere of fondly remembered games of old as well as this. I’m playing on a gaming laptop with low specs these days (I7 2060 16G), and it looks great and runs smoothly except for a slight juddering when snap turning. Hopefully, this can be rectified in future updates. But the gameplay mechanics, environments, and fun factor are so good that I stop noticing it after a few minutes.",Apr 7 at 9:06 PM,5, 6,
