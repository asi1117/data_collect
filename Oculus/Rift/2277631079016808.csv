The form of black and white animation made me feel the tension of the atmosphere, the gap between black and white.",Jan 15 at 11:56 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:57:39.948086,Dropla,Really Great!,"At first, I was unsure if this was a second piece, in which I was missing the beginning. I am referring to the #2 in the title. It isn't the case, it's just the title. 
 This is a really interesting film, the art style brings the trial & testimony to life. Pretty powerful!",Feb 2 at 4:55 PM,5, 0,
