2022-05-28 18:13:00.108103,DelapierceD,Increasingly Complex and Engaging,"I was really wanting to find something stealthy in VR, so I first was let down to see Hitman turned into a kind of VR board game, but it looked interesting and reviews were positive. Very glad I gave this a shot

Game is very well done. First few puzzles are easy as a kind of tutorial, but the compelxity ramps up very quickly. Would love to see more of these, where the climaxes are more world-interactive, as with the theater level","Mar 14, 2021 at 3:59 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:13:00.123063,FastLawyer,"To kill or not to kill, that is question","Yes, touch works, but only as a gamepad.  It needs to work as touch controllers hands where you're physically moving the set pieces and setting up the traps manually.   This would be a 5 star game if I could use my touch controllers in that way.   Despite that obvious flaw, the gameplay is fun.  Some people say you're only moving the set pieces back and forth.  No, you're solving the puzzle so that you know exactly how to move to accomplish your set goal.  I love how there are no kill options or use less moves goals.  Very fun puzzles.  It's just fun finding creative ways to get the mission done.  I got this on sale for $2.99 and I feel like I got the heist of the century.","Dec 17, 2017 at 4:42 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 18:13:00.137026,davidtriune,for puzzle lovers,"there's about 100 levels that take about 5 minutes each, a lot of bang for your buck (and more if you go for max points). it certainly doesn't need to be in VR, and it does only to feel like a board game. But, I don't think the graphics look as good as the ad. As a puzzle game though, it was awesome and mind-tickling. If you hate puzzles then this really isn't for you (and the negative reviewers here).","Dec 23, 2017 at 11:17 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:13:00.151986,SuperDupont,Good puzzle game,"It does not share much with hitman, aside from the idea that you have to make your way through most levels undetected. 
The music is very soothing and allows you to unwind while brainstorming. Also, the game plays very well with the oculus remote which makes it very accessible as a demo to non-gamers. The level design is great and will keep you busy for probably 20-30 hours if you want to 100% the game. Recommended.","Nov 21, 2016 at 6:53 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 18:13:00.166946,SoakingRich,,"Wouldve been better off as its own game without 'the Hitman' moniker, as its nothing like a hitman game, fairly uninteresting.","Nov 15, 2016 at 9:08 AM",2, 8,
