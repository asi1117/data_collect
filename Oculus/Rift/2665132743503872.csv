I played this game with 2 other friends of mine and we had an f***ing blast.

So the gameplay is solid.  Climbing everything was incredibly fun and allowed for going through any stage however we saw fit.  Along with this, the reward system was perfect.  For every stage you can A and S rank them, and for each rank you get a weapon as a reward.

This ranking and reward system had us go through every single level and get both ranks in one sitting.  It was SO satisfying.  The challenge of having to only kill the targets was honestly genius.  The final level killing only the targets WAS THE MOST INTENSE VR EXPERIENCE WE HAVE EVER HAD.  Climbing underneath the levels, hanging from every spot possible and lining up the perfect shot was so tactical, it was rad.

Another thing to add.  I don't know if the dev intended this, BUT YO, F***ING ROCKET JUMPING.  Using the rocket launcher to rocket jump through levels, using it tactically as well as setting up sick trick shots was the most fun I think I've had in VR.  It was so silly and fun that it just worked great.

I also bought this on steam just to further support the developer.  Fantastic job, my friends and I would gladly throw money your way in order to recieve more levels, weapons, a second game, whatever you could do!  I adored this experience and would gladly pay for more.  Thank you very much for sharing this game with us.","Jun 1, 2020 at 2:07 PM",5, 19,
