2022-05-28 13:50:21.156228,pathmakerjen,Magic At My Fingertips and Deep Strategy,"Playing through Acolytes single player campaign, I was blown away by how great this feels to play. I'm an anime fan; this felt like wielding magic for real just like in the shows, including needing to think on my feet. 

The community discord is incredibly helpful especially as you learn to duel. Online pvp duels happen every Saturday at 2pm-4pm US Eastern, and are active as of March 2020 - there are always people playing during that time window! Join us!  (Alternate times are available by asking on Discord.)  There's also The Unspoken Fandom Wiki with tons of detailed information and links to stream videos.

The team that built this moved on to Stormlands next (it's great too). The Unspoken isn't receiving software updates, but it still plays great, and there's an active (and newly growing) player base.  It works with Quest + Link cable.

The really rich game play happens in online duels against other players.  They'll welcome beginners, teach you techniques that the tutorials don't mention, and help you learn the depth of strategy and combo moves you can do as each class.  The game is a brilliant mix of thoughtful strategy and fast reflexes (the better you are at strategy, the less critical reflexes become).  It's a very welcoming community of players who deeply love the game and play for fun (and yes, we have some women among advanced players!).  

Top players still participate on chat and in game on a regular basis, sharing strategies and tips. Beginner and intermediate players provide a more suitable duel for beginners and are also available for regular games.  Games are arranged through the The Unspoken Discord, #looking_for_game channel, out of headset (because waiting in headset is boring), so join that ahead of trying to jump into the Battle > Duel queue, and announce when you're ready to play.","Mar 14, 2020 at 8:27 AM",5, 40,
2022-05-28 13:50:24.292653,Buzzarag,An amazing game kinda abandoned?,"This game is amazing, in no other VR game magic feels as realistic and natural as in this one. So one star for the game-mechanics!
The game looks really good and the single player is in a big dirty city. The effects are very beautiful. Another star for the graphics!

But here it kinda ends. Very sudden and somehow undeserved.
The media of the game ends in 2017, as if the whole team behind the game vanished, no more announcements, no more hyping. They just seem to be gone?
The story got very interesting and I really want to know how it continues!
There are some things that need a change and update like deeper customization of your character (including the gender) and more modes for singleplayer.
The disappearance of the team behind the game caused the community to thin out, badly even, though the game could easily be one of the best on VR!

This game makes you more feel like a hero than most of the hero-games available so why did the devs drop this game???
Can someone contact the devs and tell them that people are interested in their game and want more???","Mar 5, 2020 at 10:25 AM",2, 41,

2022-05-28 13:50:24.335539,Glitch Fandango,This is my favourite VR game!,"I love this game! Honestly, it’s brilliant and I play a quick session every time I put on my headset. 

The spells are intuitive, each class offers a distinctive style of play, it’s both strategic and action packed. There’s an amazing feeling of immersion that comes with game mechanics like this, and standing in these arena tossing spells around is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in VR. Actually, the first time I summoned the “Ferris wheel spider” is still my top moment in VR.

The single player mode is great (if a little short) but you can’t skip the dialogue so replaying levels gets annoying. That said, I’m on my fourth play through now, so can’t be that bad.

A good PvP when you match up against someone on your skill level is for me, the most fun I’ve had in VR. There’s something really exhilarating and moreish about a closely matched game that reminds me of the countless hours I put into Streetfighter as a kid.

The game is primarily a multiplayer game, and I will say that sadly this long after launch it’s hard to get a game unless you go through the discord group (who are fantastic btw). These guys have really made me feel welcome and definitely helped me engage with this awesome game.

The Discord community actually deserves its own 5* review and is worth a mention here. There are regular weekly events for all skill levels and the more advanced players are only too happy to give tips and help newer players advance. There are some great casual players in the mix as well, so you don’t need to invest hours in skills to have a great time.

For me personally, it is soooo close to perfect. As it is, this is really a 4 1/2* review, but If they introduced a Street Fighter style single player tournament mode, or a wave based arena mode just to flesh out the solo options this would definitely be the best game on the platform (imo).","Mar 14, 2020 at 5:44 PM",4, 16,

Its a very immersive story driven game, and theres also very competetive online battles :D If you like magic this game is VERY satisfying to play, throwing fire balls around the arena was great fun. The only issues are that the match making when i played was very... Bad i suppose, while there are tons of people on the discord ready for battling you, you would have to message on discord and set up a game otherwise you would be waiting 30 minutes. This game obviously isnt for everyone, so id say give it a shot, if you dont like it, return the game and buy something else :D But this game was definitely worth it for me :)","Oct 7, 2019 at 8:32 PM",5, 8,

But sadly it's only against an Anarchist. I'd like to see the other mages built as AI adversaries. Maybe one at a time, over time, until all are added. Brilliant game.

It does work with the Rift S. A recent tracking update was pushed out and it works just fine.

I do have to say that these controllers eat batteries. I use Eneloop rechargeables and have to swap them out at the start of each VR session. I've found that if the batteries aren't well charged, the tracking suffers.","Aug 12, 2019 at 3:19 AM",5, 4,

It is fun, energetic or not energitic, depends on how you want to play. The game is POLISHED!!! Oculus Studios guys. Not 1 bug or glitch. Even hanging at home and watching the large TV is entertaining. All the small things really add up and then make a FANTASTIC single player game ontop, this game deserves 9 out of 10 stars! not just 5. I havent tried real multipler to much, but I hear (or read from the comments...) its hard to find matches sometimes. I havent had a problem and had a crazy duel with someone. So many things to unlock and go back for. This game was featured in a world wide league for dueling MP for some contest, can even read it in the news paper in your home lol. Please Oculus and developers, continue this game. I can see it will always be a 1 of a kind special game. Buy it, you wont be disapointed. I finished Defector just now but then I thought this game is way better in many ways. Anyways, buy it! and Devs keep the content coming, happy to pay $50 for a full dLC of this anyday!!!!!

2022-05-28 13:50:33.756659,ArtoriasPlaysGames,Incredible and addicting... but empty.,"This is possibly one of the best VR experiences I ever had. I love moving my body and doing different gestures to cast different spells, and the story was absolutely incredible, all though short. (but I am willing to overlook that as the ending seemed to hint at a continued story in maybe DLC form) the multiplayer is really fun and ive enjoyed almost every moment. However, the game feels a little... dead. I hardly can ever find any matches, and when I do, I finish the game, search for another, and get paired with the same guy over and over which is extremely concerning. But at least you can duel Lenore who has decent AI. And the emptiness of the multiplayer is not the devs fault. If I had to make suggestions for this incredible game, it would be: More spell variety. Okay cool, so I can hold my hands together to create a focused arcane attack, or I can cross my arms and push forward to create different kinds of defensive barriers depending on my class, and I can hold my hands together in the air and create death from above. okay, cool, but thats only three gestures that are the same for EVERY class. (one slightly different one for the drifter but still pretty much the same) add more gestures and spells, make it like how you equip your artifacts, bring different gestures and spells with you, three to be precise. I say this because I think one of the coolest things about being a sorcerer would be learning new spells, so to live out our fullest magic weilding fantasy in this game let us do that. also, why genderlock characters? I dunno call me over the top but as much as I love playing Blackjack the female genderlock makes it hard to be... immersed. We need to feel like were playing ourselves so I dunno wouldnt hurt to add that gender change option. Im sure girls end up feeling similiarly when playing the Anarchist or Kineticist. Also, more game modes would be nice. I hate to say it but the 1v1 duels get kinda boring, add more! all in all I love it! good work devs!","Jun 21, 2019 at 4:46 AM",4, 14,

2022-05-28 13:50:36.885413,PUZZELE,SCARED OF HEIGHTS?  I CERTAINLY WAS!!!!!,"I rarely write reviews, perhaps because I rarely agree with reviews I even bother to read.  But I wanted to point out one thing that nobody seems to mention about this game which I think is incredibly impressive/immersive:

Lots of the game is played on roof tops.  And at least to me, I legitimately got very very very SCARED about the height.  I literally was having trouble physically looking around because I was so scared.  Admittedly, this sounds ridiculous but I tried over several days (each time thinking I was just being silly), but nope... I really felt SCARED about the height issue.  For this reason alone, I'd definitely recommend this game.  I've watched countless movies and played countless games in my lifetime but NEVER can I remember ever being SCARED and could barely move.

As for the game itself.. It was nicely done.. not necessarily my cup of tea because I always prefer to physically dodge (step left/right) to avoid bullets instead of teleporting/shield...   but via the FEAR of being so high and the impressive graphics, I'd definitely recommend this game.  Honestly, even if the game did allow me to move around, I embarrassingly wouldn't be able to because I'm telling you... I was friggin' scared!!  (PS:  In real life, I'm in my 40s and have in fact gone sky diving, bungee jumping and hot air ballooning.  I have *NO* idea why this game scared me soooooo much about the height but it did..  and that is indeed incredible!).  I do NOT see anybody else talking about the height issue so perhaps it was just ME (and I'm just a big baby), but I felt it certainly deserves mention and praise.  :)

Quite frankly, I cannot think of ANY other game or movie that I've ever seen in my entire life where I literally would not want to teleport to the top of the building because I would be SCARED about the height (despite the top of the building being a better location to shoot the bad guys).  How ridiculous and/or cool is that!?

Job well done.  :)","May 18, 2019 at 1:32 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 13:50:36.949242,taquitobuddy,Wish I could give this one 5 stars,"So much about this game is fantastic - the graphics, environments, music, voice acting, VR implementation, lots of different modes and features, progression system, ranked play, etc.  Unfortunately, all of that doesn't really count for much when there is only about 2 hours of content here because the multiplayer is dead and the AI on Expert offers 0 challenge if you understand the basics of how to play.  The story mode is well done but short, maybe 1-2 hours total.  Double that if you want to run through it again on Master level.  Then that's it, nothing else to do, because no one is playing and the single AI opponent offers no challenge.

Hindsight is 20/20, but it was a very poor design decision to not focus on adding a great solo experience with a good variety of different AI types (at least one of each class, with varying artifact loadouts) and difficulty.  A shame such an otherwise amazing game comes to nothing.","Jul 17, 2019 at 11:58 PM",2, 6,

2022-05-28 13:50:43.245026,Darkamisama,Excellent Game,"I usually don't write reviews (due to being lazy), but this game really deserves it.  The graphics are outstanding (as good as robo recall).  the game play itself is very fun and feels natural.  The 5 classes in the game provides a decent variety which you would definitely find atleast one class you'll like.  The game is centered around PVP (even though it has a new single player campaign if you don't like pvp).  The PVP of the game is fun although I'm new and get beaten by high rankers all the time ( my advice: DON'T BE AFRAID TO LOSE, YOU'll GET BETTER EVENTUALLY).  For example, at first I can't even damage the high rank players who are good, but after a day playing I was able to win a few rounds against high rankers (I'm a quick learner :P).  I especially enjoy the combat, because it isn't just about mindlessly throwing spells at other players.  You actually figure out strategies to win (which spell to use, when to use shield, and when to dodge, etc). 

The Biggest and Only problem with this game IMO is the fact that there are not enough players when it comes to rank matching.  It takes a long time to find a match, but luckily they have a active discord community where you could just get the discord app and ask for matches, simple, right? Here is a invite link https://discord.gg/fVanwbv

I do hope the developers would add some variety to the solo duel npc like have a npc of each class to solo duel with (I don't need it now but it would had been nice when I was unfamiliar) so people would have a feel to how to deal with each class when playing them in rank without having to get stomped by high rankers first to get the experience XD.

Overall, I would highly recommend buying this game for $20, it's well worth the price.

Lastly, developers you did a great job at making this game!  I look forward to more updates and content in the future! :D","Feb 4, 2019 at 2:46 AM",5, 11,

Something is wrong with their savegame methodology, and after playing you will find yourself having lost all of your achievements and gains.  If this is going to be the case you need to provide a way to bypass all of the 'starting tutorial' crap at the beginning of the game because at this point there is no way to bypass it.

(This assumes you don't find anyone in que - I have found people in que when playing during peak times.) Do your friends join you in Paintballing with a click of your finger? Or do you arrange it? Arranging games on Discord is even easier. If hesitant buying: Firstly there is the single player story game. Buying it for the single player experience is great in itself. Then to get even more out of the game, replay the addictive multiplayer, again & again. The fun never stops! This game is a total bargain - worth full price alone due to it's highly addictive replayable multiplayer. A match lasts around 10 minutes of 1v1 duels that are just awesome.  When it's on sale, then you should hesitate even less. Just see it as paying for single player with a bonus free multiplayer (there is AI, then join Discord to realise the multiplayer to it's potential) . Even if 10 new players the join the Discord (this sale), that's already more than enough. Just post in the section #looking_For_Game, whenever you want to play, and let others reply. Remember, this is VR. We do not need to create a viscous circle calling it dead when it isn't. A message to AppleAssassin calling multiplayer dead. I played you a good hour that night. What great duels I had with you. Two reviewers before yours advised to join Discord. SO WHY AREN'T YOU THERE??? I want to play you more & many others do too!","Jun 28, 2018 at 5:27 PM",5, 46,

2022-05-28 13:50:59.041826,Desjos,One of the best titles for VR to date,"One of the very few games I've played that feels like a polished, complete AAA game rather than an indie project. Graphics are great, the storyline is pretty good, the environments are fantastic and particularly unique and compelling, and the combat is satisfying and fun. Progression can be achieved both through multiplayer or singleplayer, and unlocks access to new artifacts (special abilities) and classes, which are all completely unique (no reskins or anything of the like). 

My only criticism, and it is very minor, is that while the tracking works great in first-person, it looks fairly 'off' from other perspectives. That is, watching another player (or yourself in the mirror) doing a particular gesture or motion doesn't really look like it should - but you'll rarely notice this anyway.","Mar 12, 2018 at 1:19 PM",5, 12,

I explained that they did not list that in the system requirements and that I could not get a refund from Oculus because I had played the game for 3 hours prior to the crash.  They said I was basicaly out of luck.  At the time of this writing they have still not updated thier system requirements and will not refund me.   DO NOT buy this game if you are not running Windows 10!

**EDIT**  Since my review and emails to the game makers they added Windows 10 to the system requirements and have tried to be very helpful, although I was unable to get a refund.  I am rasing my review from 1 star to 4 as the parts of the game I could play were great.

The graphics are great and the game is too, so you have to really work at it to get good enough to beat the computer or others in the game. After you do the tutorial there's an option to play against the computer and you can set whether it to make it easier or not. So it's not in fact the short game. That was just the intro. There have different levels and with each level are new weapons and spells and you get to choose whether to level up or not. The only thing I will say is if you plan on competing with another person make sure you're up to snuff because these are great players who are playing this. But all in all it's a really fine game with lots of room for advancement. I've been playing it for 6 months off and on and I still enjoy it but like I said you have to be skillful to be competitive in it even with the computer. So those who are saying that the game is short for single player have not noticed that option at the game board. You can play all day long against the computer and you can even level up by winning a game against it. Like I said though it was my first game ever but it really knocked my socks off.

That said, the story mode is only a few hours tops. It looks like from that point the game opens up into PVP combat with other players but when I tried I wasn't able to find a game.

Moments later all that changes.  There is no story mode at this moment in time outside of the brief tutorial, which may be a major turn off for some.  In its place is a one on one competitive strategy game.  There is a lot of strategizing involved in the game, such as what to equip yourself with, where to move, when to dodge, and how to get an enemy make the wrong move.  Its all mind games, and I love it.  Sadly there are many hours of the day in which players are no where to be found(I tend to find matches between 5 PM and 12 AM est).  In addition, there are only 5 characters, all of which allow for multiple unique playstyles, but regardless can get a bit repetitive as certain strategies seem to be common.

Game runs smooth as butter on my Xeon /w 1070. It has great sense of presence, the surroundings are very detailed and love all the visual effects. I would award 5 stars, but what i find a bit lacking is matchmaking. I get matched against people that are way higher level. Perhaps it would be nice to make the wait time longer, but get a better suited oponent? I would not mind, i understand such a new game needs some time to build up broader playerbase.

Game has a steep learning curve, so if you're not willing to invest time and learn from your losses, you might get bored easily and think this game is shallow. It isnt! It allows for a lot of combinations of strategies and techniques. You physically need to master quite some moves to get things going, i love it.

The biggest issue for me is its matchmaking system. If you are a new player, you're most likely going to get paired up with someone who is experienced, and you're probably going to get mowed. As a result, it's not going to get you to keep playing. However, I once hosted an event where we had 2 VR Ready PCs and 2 Oculus units. Playing head to head in real life was fun. Ultimately, it's not fun unless you are playing with people who are similar to your skill level. If the matchmaking was a little better to find people closer to your skill I'd rate it higher.

OH!  I also love that the duels don't have to be about killing each other. They can be point based as well.  BRILLIANT!","Jun 16, 2017 at 11:58 AM",5, 2,

The combination of the constant back-and-forth of your primal spell & shield coupled with the quick grabs & destroys of embers to gain the upper hand by using & denying gesture spells, with smart use of artifacts and the ever-delightful Guardians, this game is hard to beat. Frequent free content updates & a very accessible development team with whom you can discuss game details & intermittently fight is a huge plus as well.

Only downsides are the small playerbase, leading to many dead hours in which you'll struggle to find a game and the matching of veteran players with beginners, resulting in bloodbaths, and the progress loss bug, where you're at risk of getting unlocked classes, artifacts, skins & auras re-locked, with the latter 2 being impossible to re-gain without the aid of Insomniac's support team.","Apr 16, 2017 at 3:12 AM",5, 1,

I often get beaten as there are a lot of good people out there, but the whole physical element to the gameplay and the tactical nature of it - plus the awesome visuals - just make it a really fun experience.
I agree with others that the game feels like it was designed with a single-player story campaign in mind. The world you get a glimpse of during the introduction/tutorial is really tantalising.

2022-05-28 13:52:30.712904,Virtuix_,Great game; needs more to do,"Firstly, I'd like to say the experiences this game offers are superb! The graphics are stunning, and it really does make you feel like a wizard. I just wish it lasted a bit longer, or had a bit more to do. There are 3 different classes to play with and a couple different abilitys to unlock; but you can unlock all of these within an hour or so of gameplay and from then on I've found it to become rather repetitive and somewhat boring. Also - it only offers multiplayer battles; and sometimes you can end up waiting 5+ minuites for an opponent to battle. I would recommend this game for the experiences it offers; but if you are looking for a game to provide hours and hours of gameplay I would look elsewhere.


Edit: The Arcane Update is excellent! This gives me confidence the developers will be continually adding new spells and maps, which should allow the game to last a lot longer. One of my main problems has also been fixed - and this is the main reason I will now continue to play the game; they've given you something to do while waiting for your opponent! You can shoot at red targets. Its amazing how much such a small addition really can change the game. I'm no longer like ""Oh no, stood there for 5 minutes doing nothing"" whenever my cursor hovers over The Unspoken.


Edit 2: Just recieved their second update. It seems to be heading towards a new update every month, which is great news! It really is promicing to see a team of active developers releasing such amazing and well-thought out updates so often. I have boosted my rating up to 5 stars. If you own Oculus Touch then this game is a must-have. I am really looking forward to future updates, especially after seeing the sneak-previews they released on their website in December, there are some truly great things in store for us!

Here is a great tip for everyone that doesn't know this. Oculus has a zero refund policy. They will let a non functioning game take and keep your money. So if you just use steam they work great with the rift and you can get most of the games there and their refund policy is ""We will refund your money on ANY game for ANY reason within 14 days of purchase."" I found this out while searching for help on the issue unspoken was giving me and Oculus politely and in different words said ""Sucks to be you""","Feb 16, 2017 at 5:41 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 13:52:43.431289,Javelin396,Great PVP experiance!,"simple gestures that generate powerful feelings of wizarding mastery. the basics are easy to learn but can be difficult to master and be used effectively against your opponents . There's a special kind of VR magic ( yay puns) when you cast that first fireball, or block and reflect your opponents spells, or use your first artifact item to make the first javelin you use to hurl at your foe. the classes play similarly enough so that going from one to another feels familar, but there are enough differences between how their basic attacks/gesture based skills function so that each one feels unique, and has their own strengths and weaknesses. combine that with the ability to equip 6  or so different special ""one time use"" artifact abilities into 3 equipment slots makes for some interesting choices as to what you choose to take into battle with you to complement you playstyle and shake up your opponents strategies. For what it is, this game is an excellent choice for one on one pvp, however, when the game starts it leaves you with a tutorial that makes you want more from this new world of urban magic insomniac has created. there is no single player to speak of other than the opening tutorial,  a practice mode against a singe enemy class (would have been nice to be able to at least fight against bots from the other two classes but the only one you can fight against is the anachist class) or target practice mode that has you shoot at non combative orbs. Aside from that i have had several match queues that would take a long time to get into (5-10 mins or more to find 1 person to fight), or it would seemingly match me with someone only to have them never appear, in which case i would be stuck  waiting longer or i would relog to the apartment screen.

There's a chick talking to you about fantasy stuff, you feel like Dr. Strange pulling off cool magic moves and then... boom... pvp only.  PVP ONLY!!!! This game needs a single player mode, make some AI enemies that build in difficulty, throw in a little story in between random boss battles and you'd have a game.  Instead what I mistook as a ""story"" was just a tutorial for pvp.  A bait and switch that, had I bought the game, I'd be furious.  I received it for free so that's fine but for those of you who DON'T have this included for free with your Touch Controllers, stay away unless there's some update that adds a campaign OR you buy it knowing that this is a PVP ONLY game.  If you're into that you'll enjoy it, the beginnings of an excellent game are there.  But the trailers made me think this had a campaign.  I've bought a lot of VR games, this is one that I personally would never buy if I knew it was a PVP only magic fighting game.

The only thing this game is lacking which annoys me is the lack of a ranking system and win/loss record. I get how the ranking system could be a bit tricky but a win/loss record should be simple enough and included. All PVP games should have a win/loss record, since this game doesn't I had to give it a 4/5. Once this is added it will be a 5 star, especially assuming they will add more characters and levels. If your on the fence buy it and give it some time to practice and get use to controls. I mean, the game lets you cast freaking burning skull with flames, with your hands and throw them toward enemies, if that's not fun I dont know what is.
