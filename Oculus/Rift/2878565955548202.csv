2022-05-28 20:38:53.342353,Psychwardy,3D Environment Nightmare,"Uncontrollable movement. You are able to rotate 360 degrees, and you move your hands towards markers. Once you have completed the processes, you violently moved to the next location. 

The French seem to have a weird sense of video entertainment. This game is like riding a rollercoaster that is going to randomly take you in a diferent direction, you are going to fall, and be pushed. 

I would not recommend this if you get motion sickness.","Apr 27, 2021 at 11:51 PM",1, 6,"Hello, thank you for your feedback. Were you able to try the experiment again? Can you tell us more about the uncontrollable movements? We are at your disposal to solve this problem. Concerning the motion sickness we advise you to try the experience while sitting."
2022-05-28 20:38:53.356316,FastLawyer,"nice, trippy, artsy, musical experience",It's about 13 minutes long. I think it's worth the free download. You basically look around and click and feel the musical sounds transform & vibrate into something else. It's pretty out there. Not the best graphics. Simple click operations.,"May 9, 2021 at 3:10 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:38:53.371276,Marinaxp,At least it is free.,"Dark,gloomy , still  and mildly frightening experience. To be fair I only went as far as been submerged in dark water watching ice molecules glow for  some time.  This is my first bad review not because this experience is the  worst  but because I am getting frustrated with developers who think most people enjoy hanging out  in darkness surrounded by water or space.","Apr 25, 2021 at 7:32 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 20:38:53.386236,Chadd-Westland,Amazing,"It is very good just give it time to get going.

To start there is a gentleman speaking to you in German, but just let that finnish.

Once the storm starts you are off : )

Enjoy God Bless","Apr 26, 2021 at 7:23 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:38:56.506889,bosmaru,Extraordinary,The most beautiful VR experience I have ever seen.  Well worth any time put into it.  Thank you developers for creating such an amazing experience.,"Apr 25, 2021 at 6:05 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:38:56.521849,jplanasbielsa,Low quality images/videos,"Virtually all images and videos shown are of an awful quality. It does not only make it impossible to feel the experience but it even gives you headaches (at least to me. I was not even able to finish it and I had to went to sleep after just 10 minutes of playtime)

Edit for the developer: I am using Rift S powered by an RTX 3070, but, looking at your website, you can already see that the quality of the 360º videos is really low... you should increase it.","May 1, 2021 at 4:33 PM",1, 1,"Hello, thank you for your feedback, on which material did you test? This will allow you to see where the problem is?"

2022-05-28 20:38:56.550772,byteframe,"Excellent, I liked it alot.","Has great music, like Biopshere. I really liked the part where you go into the belly of the earth. It's mostly 360 video content, but might have some 3d bits, I'm not sure.","May 8, 2021 at 3:56 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:38:56.566729,QwertyQuesty,An exquisite piece of art,"While I'm not a fan of 360 videos because of the technological limitations which result usually in a blurry pixelated mess, this experience manages to mix and match 360 video with sound (loops and compositions by French artist Molecule), trippy 3D visuals and effects and haptic feedback.  A recommended sit-through (rapid motion might not be for someone without VR legs).","Jun 17, 2021 at 4:09 AM",5, 1,
