Each level adds a new game mechanic and new bits to your store inventory, and it smoothly ramps up in difficulty.   Graphics aren't top of the line, but it's still great fun, and I just used this game in place of a morning workout!","Dec 24, 2018 at 2:34 AM",5, 8,

The whole idea and style of the game is really appealing... same concept as those cooking games where you serve customers within a time limit. It gets a little repetative, but I'm not sure how that could be changed. I wish you could pick between a couple different background music. I also think they could have done a better job with the preview video too.","Mar 26, 2018 at 8:36 AM",4, 11,
