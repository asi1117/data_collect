2022-05-28 15:37:22.487300,DelapierceD,Swimming Sim w/Stakes,Very fun. Great to move around. I find myself actually holding my breath and/or gasping for air sometimes. Dramatic mystical elements too,"Mar 9, 2021 at 5:48 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:37:22.502260,Slick1984,Drowning Simulator,"This game is short. I think that is due to the quality over quantity, concept. During this game, you may experience as close to drowning as possible without actually drowning. I experienced slight panic and relief. 

The movement is the way it is, because it's a VR game and you are underwater. Why would there be any other type of movement option? VR gives the experience without having to be in those situations IRL.

For the guy that ""works out at the gym"", maybe sell your VR HMD to someone that gets it? VR is made for the person to move and experience. Are your other VR games steated experiences where  you aren't moving your arms? I can think of some of those. If you are into car racing or piloting your plane/spaceship. Other than those types of games, most are of the moving around type.

Do you play Beat Saber, Box VR or any number of games similar to those? Then you are working out and probably sweating.

If you want 2D movement, play 2D games. It's really sad to think that someone is complaining about having to swim, in an underwater game.","Oct 4, 2020 at 9:30 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 15:37:22.518218,bl00dfukker1,Horrible locomotion.,I'm sure this is a great game for those who want to workout while they play. You seriously couldn't include different locomotion options? You have to constantly flail your arms to move. There's no reason for this guys. Just make it an option and I'll give a better rating. I workout at the gym.. not in VR,"Sep 30, 2020 at 5:31 AM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 15:37:22.548137,WillerTan,I like it,"Awesome graphic, movement control is great, close but still a bit unature, As an open water swimmer, I wish they can add free style or come out a new game call swimming simulator for swimmer during COVID19 lockdown :)","May 23, 2020 at 2:43 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:37:25.675772,chocolateyum,Up there with lone echo,"I was really surprised at the quality of this game.  It’s extremely well polished.  The visuals and mechanics are almost as good as lone echo which sets the bar in VR games as far as I’m concerned.  I didn’t like the ending of the narrative but besides that, the ga,e had a good story to it too.

It’s short, I finished the game in about 2 hours and I’m typically slower than many.  But for the price, it’s definitely worth it for the quality.

My only complaint is that there isn’t any free crossbuy with the oculus quest.","Apr 10, 2020 at 8:34 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:37:25.691729,SnowUse,No cross buy.,"Seriously? Games with in infinite amount of replay value (Audica, Ultrawings) are cross buy. This game was fantastic. I do not regret buying it. But I beat it and I'll probably never play it again. Would've been cool to try on my Quest.","Feb 26, 2020 at 5:37 AM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 15:37:25.706690,jayrock55,very impressed,This game reminded me of lone echo only under water. I did find the begining a bit boring  just like lone echo  but once you get into it you will find it to be very exciting. It only gets better as you progress. Quality of this game is up there with the very best. But like people have said its a very short experience. Think it took me about 1 1/2 hours and there is no real replayability. But think of it as buying a movie ticket. At this price I found it well worth it.,"Jan 10, 2020 at 1:36 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:37:25.721649,taquitobuddy,"Short experience, nice graphics","This is a short little 10-15 minute experience with no replay value.  The graphics are quite nice, but the turning (movement) leaves something to be desired.  Can't really recommend.  If you do pick it up, wait for a big sale, like 75%+ off.","Apr 26, 2020 at 8:01 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 15:37:25.737606,Scoremonger,Feels like the opening of a bigger game,"I don't know the history of this title, but it feels like it was meant to be the start of a bigger, more ambitious game, and for whatever reasons the devs were only able to make a single episode's worth of content. What's there is pretty nice, though - good visuals, fairly good swimming controls, decent voice acting, etc. The puzzles are fairly simple but I liked them. However, it's pretty short. Around 30 minutes from start to finish, for me. This would be fine if there were more episodes in the series, (like Vader Immortal), but sadly, at this point I don't think there will be any follow up to this game. One other warning - if you're prone to motion sickness, this game is probably going to trigger it for you. I like to think I have my VR sea legs, but by the end of playing this I was a little queasy.","Nov 19, 2019 at 4:33 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 15:37:28.832329,tveith,Please add cross buy!!,"It makes absolutely no sense that you would sell this on the Oculus store for $5 Canadian and on the quest store for $16 Canadian. From what I understand, this is only a 1 hour VR experience. Likely not worth more than $10. It would be a show of good faith if you would enable Cross buy for those who purchased it on Rift or Quest.","Feb 28, 2020 at 2:08 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 15:37:28.847289,starship42,Rift S vs Quest version?,"I'm going to be upfront - I have not played this game, yet. I haven't even installed it. Just purchased the Rift S version yesterday. I am in a quandry because today I noticed the Quest ""Extended Version"" has dropped for a much larger price. It claims to have added more content, YET... it is a much, much smaller file size. Now, I'd guess the Quest ""extended version"" has been stripped down in quality to accomodate the Quest's processing capability? Fair enough, but then why leave the original at a reduced price (on sale)? Two separate versions of the same game? Sort of? This just leaves me confused and wanting a refund and not bother giving it a chance. It seems I'm meant to choose between a stripped down ""extended content"" version, at a much larger price, versus a ""shorter"" yet richer graphical original version to suit the Rift S, with less content, on sale... of the exact same game. Sort of. Or perhaps the devs are hoping I'd pay for both? I just don't know what to do. AND, there's no crossbuy option. This isn't making my decision easy. Unless I just ask for a refund. That would be easy. Don't get me wrong, I really want to try this product and give it a chance. It looks promising. But I don't like being put into a position of choosing between two questionable, less than satisfactory options, as a game consumer, to choose between two almost, yet less than ideal, identical twins.","Feb 26, 2020 at 7:45 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 15:37:28.862249,user045,A Hidden Gem,Very impressed with what I have played so far in terms of graphics and gameplay. Its unique and different and has a strong sense of being underwater. Very realistic. Best I have come across.,"Jan 7, 2020 at 5:53 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:37:28.876212,oysterassassin,Glad I paid only five bucks,As a retired industrial diver I found the locomotion shockingly bad. It was cheap. Maybe some neighbor kid will play it. I won't.,"Dec 29, 2019 at 9:34 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 15:37:28.891172,HacXander,Nice but short.,"Very enjoyable game, good story, intuitive controlls, best swimming mechanics i encountered, it just ends abruptly and it's kinda short.","Dec 14, 2019 at 6:58 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:37:32.001852,VRPhantom,A Fun Adventure,"I finished this game a while ago but never got around to writing a review. Overall I really enjoyed Freediver. I played the game on a swivel chair raised up high so my feet did not touch the floor and that greatly helped with immersion. Graphically the game looked outstanding and it had an excellent sense of presence. The sound was quite low thru my Rift S speakers, to the point where I could barely hear anything, so this one is best played with a set of earphones or earbuds. The controls and swimming mechanics were very well done and lended a nice sense of authenticity to the game. Some people complained about the game's length but given the pricepoint I thought it was just fine and didn't outwear its welcome. Overall, it's a fun experience and I would happily buy more self-contained adventures like this one.","Oct 1, 2019 at 3:03 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:37:32.016812,inferor,Nice free diving experience,"To make that one a really immersive free diving experience: only breathe while your avatar is breathing in-game! That way you won't forget to look for Oxygen supplies and it's possible!
while it could have been longer, I'm totally satified with that game.","Oct 5, 2019 at 5:11 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:37:32.031772,JATTACKPOHL,Incredible immersive experience,"The game ran extremely smooth on my I7 1070 with the highest graphic settings.   No it's not long, but what it lacks in length in more than makes up for in experience and gameplay.  Very intuitive controls.  You feel like you are there.  I purchased on sale for $6 well worth the money even at full price.","Aug 11, 2019 at 4:45 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:37:32.046732,Maxgz,Simply Amazing,"For the time spent playing this game, I must say i felt truly immersed. If you are going to play this on the rift s, I suggest you invest in some good quality headphones for the full experience. At times this game can get a bit scary, and you forget you’re actually playing a game. I even find myself holding my breath at times.  Well done developers, the back story behind the game is great. We need more games like this, hopefully we’ll get to see a part 2 with a much greater depth very soon.","Jun 8, 2019 at 1:30 PM",5, 25,
2022-05-28 15:37:35.134473,Morfeos,Great underwater experience in VR,"I'm surprised at all the reviews calling this experience a 'demo'. It's way more than that. I agree it's short, but for under $10, there's a lot going on here. For starters, the graphics are great, and ran without any issues on my GTX 1070, i7-6700, 16GB system. The level of design and movement combined reminded me a little of Lone Echo. 

The atmosphere and swimming mechanics really make this game stand out. As you would expect, everything is upside down in the capsizing ship about to become your tomb. It's disorienting enough, but it also shifts, so the air pocket that's there one minute might be gone the next. This adds some tension, as you need to manage the air supply with getting to the next objective.

Overall I had a blast playing it and recommend it if you like intense underwater games.","Jul 18, 2019 at 1:07 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:37:35.149433,ChuckB,Really Really Cool,"This is great, and well worth the the cost for the unique experience.  

I really enjoyed what I've played so far, the locomotion is probably the best I've seen for swiming yet.  It definitally sets the bar for underwater traversal.  

Really cool, great job devs!","Jun 14, 2019 at 1:13 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:37:35.164393,ccdeltabeta,If The Abyss and Subnautica Had a Baby..,"...this game might've been it. It is a brief exploration/adventure game held 'under da sea'.  Locomotion is made by moving your arms in front of you like you are swimming, although turning felt weird using only one arm.  At times, moving about reminded me of Lone Echo for some reason (like pushing off walls, I guess).
The gameplay itself is relatively simple, and you are basically spoon-fed on what you need to do next.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, given how fast your oxygen can deplete (dying from lack of O2 while trying to figure out what to do next could be even more frustrating).  Given the gameplay choices thay made for this game, I think it works rather well.
The game lasted about an hour for myself, which is about an hour too short, given the price (my opinion only).  However, I can not complain too much about it, because the overall quality of the experience was nicely immersive, and I only looked at my watch when I unexpectedly finished the game.  This game has potential to be much more than what the game actually shows; which is probably my biggest complaint.
With regards to the story, I could've actually done without the Abyss storyline.  This game, for its price and length, could've just as easily been an underwater exploration game, and I would've been just as happy (especially since I have no clue if this is 'it' for the game); a cliffhangar without a promise of a sequel can be a bit of a tease (and not in a good way).
I could almost envision a movement system where you move your arms behind you (like if you were kicking with fins) should this game ever decide to go scuba, except I have no confidence if the Rift S could ever support this kind of movement scheme (whereas the original Rift could).
I've read some reviews to where they criticize the game as being a demo, and I don't think they are very wrong.  But I've got to give credit to a demo ,that at times, drew me out of my world, and made me believe I was in theirs.","Jun 8, 2019 at 5:00 PM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 15:37:35.179353,manbearpig400,Gorgeous game!!!!!!!!!!!!,"very immersive, amazing visuals, easy movement, overal very good game, my guests loved it and so did I. This is a steal for the price I 100% recommend","Jun 19, 2019 at 12:41 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:37:35.194313,Siegfriedshead,Really fun experience.,"The graphics are good, the gameplay is interesting, there's lots of places to breath in oxygen so while it does have a time limit on your air it's not overbearing. The game is short. You can beat it in one sitting if you go fast. That's why it's about 10 bucks I guess.

I hope the game developer treats this as chapter 1 and continues it into a 5 part series that late adopters can buy together as a full length game, but we can buy chapter by chapter.  This left me wanting more anyways.","Jun 1, 2019 at 9:49 AM",5, 20,

2022-05-28 15:37:38.304993,NeoEdo,I keep holding my breath in real life...,"I don't think I've ever played any underwater VR titles to this day. But honestly, I'm glad this was my first. I'm really enjoying it so far!
I've only played about 23 minutes so far (work week/grown up life, am I right).
The first time you dive under; my chest tightened up. The transition along with the sound effects of being under water are great.

This is an amazing game! I'm liking the theme of the story and how it's being told is nice. The swimming mechanism works really well too.

This was one of those surprise games that pops up in the store and you're like, ""Hmmm, this looks interesting"". The trailer sold me right away (and that price; a no brainer) Can't wait for the weekend to explore more!","May 31, 2019 at 2:48 PM",5, 13,"Wow, amazing feedback, thanks so much NeoEdo!

2022-05-28 15:37:41.431630,DavidJaffe,,"Ugh, I hate the movement in this game. I get it's the selling point and so if it's your bag then I bet you will love it. But I want to get lost in the adventure, not have a work out constantly having to hold my arms out and keep moving them just to go up/down/left/right. Immersive? Sure, I suppose so. But tiring and annoying? For me? Yep! 

I read a review before I bought and they said there was a traditional way to navigate.I was not able to find that in the menu. If I can't find it in the next hour, I'm asking for a refund. Again, if this sounds fun to you (and I GET it will be fun for some) then what I did play was fine but for me, this kind of motion is annoying. Especially when you need to swim up to O2 tanks and cartons to grab things and you overshoot it because you moved your tired arms just a little too quickly.

UPDATE: ARGH! This game, man. This is a game DYING to be loved;it does such a good job at a bunch of stuff. I've stuck with it because I love the feeling of being underwater and I love some of the navigation (using your hands to find hand holds to pull yourself along) and the exploration (especially when you start looking around the capsized ship).And look, I get it: they're a small team and prob had to get this thing out ASAP. Heck, if this is early access, then all is forgiven. Because that's what this plays like: a game with tons of cool potential but no time to bake in the oven of user testing. This is a game that demands precision motion at times: TOUCHING fire kills you INSTANTLY; there are moments designed where you will die if you don't reach air JUST IN TIME. And yet rotating is painfully slow and backing up SEEMS almost not doable (unless I'm doing it wrong). 

I read where the devs compared this to an action movie in terms of length and tension. I dig that. But right now it feels like the video game version of a low budget, straight to Netflix action movie: it's got some GREAT parts to it but it needs more time to bake. Patch perhaps?!:)","Jun 1, 2019 at 2:37 PM",2, 6,

My Initial Thoughts: 
Finally a new VR game with AAA quality and design. The sense of claustrophobia this game brings to VR is incredible. I think the experience was made even better for me with the sharpness, clarity and fidelity of the Rift S. This was superb and one of my favorite VR games this year.","Jun 1, 2019 at 8:17 AM",5, 13,
