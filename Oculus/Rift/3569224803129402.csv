2022-05-28 20:14:07.593984,psox,"Fantastic concept, excellent execution","My buddy downloaded this the day it was put on the store, he immediately told me to get it so we could try it together. The first time we loaded in it was fairly confusing, I didn't know I could reload because I was crouched the whole time (lol), but it quickly became very fun. The maps (while basic) provided for a lot of rambunctious tomfooleries. Being able to throw the guns at each other was hilarious, too. 

Obviously there were some issues: Accuracy is tough to determine, no UI, graphics aren't great, etc. but for this kind of early-access ""app"" I can be very forgiving. Can't wait to play this as a full-bore game, I'll definitely be donating to the Kickstarter.","Dec 9, 2020 at 1:02 AM",5, 22,
2022-05-28 20:14:07.608944,ianfabb,amazing game and concept,"I got this game on september of last year and was once the #1 player on the global leaderboard, throughout all of those hours and hours of playing the game I never once thought that the game was bad, the great style and mechanics didnt allow me! The developer fixes bugs and listens to peoples suggestions and also interacts with the community often. This really is a great game with a great developer.","Apr 8, 2021 at 7:25 AM",5, 1,
