2022-05-28 17:49:35.336365,robert.clarke.90857,Not bad,Great idea.  Obviously in what I hope is your initial beta testing phase.  It has potential but needs a lot of work.  Well worth the money I paid for it.  (It was free.  :D )  Make it more interactive where she asks me questions and responds to my answer either verbally or with a look or laugh.  Make it so I  can go off script and ask her my questions.  I promise I won't be asking her about rocket science or quantum theory.,"Feb 21, 2019 at 3:01 AM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 17:49:38.509878,DJHeroMasta,These 1 Star Reviews Are Funny.,"Most of them are from people who don't know how to use Win 10 and or are unfamaliar with thier peripherals. I'm not going to review this game as I don't even want to admit that I played it. (No, it's not that bad) I will say this though, remove the ""You're out of bounds"" warning and place the occupant closer to the user. Allow users to interact with the cards and physically select which one's they wish to use. Also, reduce the transition time from thier idle pose to them speaking. That breaks the immersion a fair bit. And allow users to change the backround. (Non 3D enviroments or just better optimized ones) Even a 360° Photo would've been fine. The current one is pretty resource intensive and prevented me from being able to super sample on my GTX 1060.

 Alright, to get the game working properly: Press Start on your keyboard and toye in ""Cortana"". Press Enter,  Click the first slider under ""Hey Cortana"". It will say ""Let Cortana respond to ""Hey Cortana."". Close that. Next, press Start again and type ""Sound"". Your audio control panel should now be open. Click on the ""Recording"" tab, right click on your Oculus Rift and set it as ""Default Device"". Right click it again and set ""Default Communication Device."" Now, close that and launch the game. Enjoy.","Aug 22, 2018 at 12:02 PM",3, 10,

2022-05-28 17:49:51.261770,FastLawyer,Fell in love & asked her to marry me,"So in this game, I went out on a date with Grace Van Dien.  The surrounding environment was very serene and romantic.  I started things off on the date with a game of 21 questions with Grace.  She would answer whichever of the two questions I decided from the cards the game provided.  Things were going so well, that I had to tell Grace that I had a great time and would love to continue.  Grace agreed and so I asked more questions.  Each time, Grace would answer in the most honest and sincere manner.  Not only is Grace a very beautiful woman, but she had the most impeccable facial expressions that conveyed our mutual trust and growing spiritual connection.  She would smile, and blush and just had a soft fragility showing from the squint of her eyes.  We were having such a great time together that I was hoping the day would never end.  This was a magical first date.  After all the question cards were gone, I had one final question.  ""Grace, will you marry me?""  She did not answer but she did say she had a great time and then the screen went black and back to menu.  Heartbroken, I took off my HMD and silently cried....

The actors do a great job, but the transition between idle and answering is too noticeable. Its like a complete shift. Seemless would be difficult to achieve, but it could definately be a lot better and help with immersion. When idle the actors could do with more variations. Some just sit absolutely still.

The actors appear very flat so the immersion is lost as you know you're watching a recorded video.  The videos need depth / dimension.

Completely touch free so no interaction. If you could hold the cards and throw away ones you don't want to ask that would be something.

It's a nice idea, great that it's free, needs improvement, but a fantastic start!","Sep 20, 2017 at 6:14 AM",3, 14,

With that techincal caveat out of the way, it's surprisingly immersive, even though the actors are 2D videos superimposed on a 3D environment.  At many times I found myself frustrated not because of the experience itself, but because I genuinely wanted to comment on something being said, or go off script.  I have to wonder what an experience like this could be like if a true AI were involved, that could interpret anything being said or asked, and respond with relevant questions.

While this experience is rather short, it's quite unique, and unlike anything I've ever experienced in VR before.  A nice touch is that if the interpreter didn't understand what I said, the characters responded appropriately, asking if I could repeat myself.

I would rate this a 5 if the videos were presented in 3D; that's really the only thing that truly breaks the immersion.  I can even overlook the brief fade transition from one video to another.","Sep 27, 2017 at 8:09 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:49:57.609791,Don_Thruff,As Two-dimensional as the Actor Opposite,"I hope  this concept gets updates and grows over time.  As-is it is tedious and unnatural.  Having worked in radio and having done voice work in the U.S. it did an okay job recognizing my verbal queues but in order for that to happen I had to read the cards as if I were reading copy for a commercial.  I did not feel like I was in conversation but at work on an interview with a relatively uninteresting guest.  I have used IVR systems on commercial telephone networks that had better voice recognition capabilities than this.  With such a limited and practically un-interactive response pool it feels like I have to do very complex and uncomforatble things to accomplish something incredibly simple.  When the two-dimensional video sitting across from me jump-cuts to a response it feels entirely like the fresh start of a YouTube video I would never voluntarily watch.  If anything, this works as a perfect demonstration of methods to distract the audience from any hope of immersion.  The little time I could tolerate the experience was spent fighting to connect at any emotional level and the vacant responses only added to the questionable significance of the validity of that ""36 Questions"" article this junkware was apparently inspired by.  I don't blame any of the actors for that.  I think that given a compelling format and decent writing they could deliver on the promise of connection via experience.  I felt more meanigful emotional responses in the Technolust VR narrative than in this.  My plea: work out the bugs, improve the presentation, involve the audience, vary the content, learn the psychology needed to minimally immerse the viewer, loosen the restrictive format and don't assume the end-user is always going to be the same soulless drone that thinks things are brilliant because they are marketed that way.","Oct 9, 2017 at 9:43 AM",1, 7,

2022-05-28 17:50:03.905951,Arthur_A,"Great concept, still early to work","I absolutely LOVE the concept.
However, there is many little things killing it.
1- Voice Recognition Support
You should definitly give a process to make it work for everyone, I've spent 2 hours to find where my problem came from. For non-native English users, we have to download the English voice recognition pack and activate it by default.
Even if I have a very good and fluent english accent, I have to repeat 3/4 times each questions, taking a neutral and loud voice breaking the immersion. It's a shame :/
2- Spatial game area recognition
I've been litteraly playing from the left of the table, midget sized since the Oculus Position Reset doesn't work with the game. I should have been inside a wall to be well positionned in the table ...
3- It's too obvious that the characters are 2D and between each questions, the jump cut isn't natural at all.
5- What about more cards at the same time to ask questions being more free ? What about the characters asking us questions to make us think also ?

Charismatic people.,"First, for those expressing trouble with voice pickup, I found that it doesn't use the input specified by Oculus Home but rather the one specified by Windows. You'll have to switch your Windows default mic to be the Rift microphone.

Anyway, it is a relaxing experience that does feel a bit like conversation, with sometimes very charming personalities. But be aware that you will be asking all the questions, and they giving all the answers. Of course, I suppose it couldn't reasonably be done any other way, but the description and even the dialogue gave a different impression, with Grace in particular asking, ""We have questions to ask each other, would you like to go first?"" So, I was confused for a while about whether the dynamic was going to eventually change.

The voice recognition is nothing more than the program understanding one of a dozen pre-scripted questions that no one in their right mind would ask a stranger if they were trying to get to know them. WARNING: DO NOT ask actual people any of these questions. They will possibly call the cops to report a nutjob stalking them. The models are just FMV that plays a clip of them answering the ridiculous questions. They look like flat cardboard that plays video. The program ran fine with no problems, but the graphics, both FMV and rendered, looked pretty bad.

2022-05-28 17:50:10.167205,ManMythLegend,A Complete Mess,"I've tried this app on 3 computers. All computers are gaming PCs with 1080+ and 16GB ram which are meant for VR. The first was stuck loading after the Oculus Studios screen in a black loading area. The second is unable to move beyond the first spoken audio section. The final was able to play the app...unfortunately. What a nightmare. Flat characters, awkward transitions, obvious actors, and the worst 360 environment I've ever seen. By Oculus. The most buggy mess I've played on the Rift. By Oculus. Makes me not trust Oculus even more.","Sep 23, 2017 at 9:52 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 17:50:10.184159,BananaCat,I was dissapointed.,"Especially considering the size. The scenery was bland for a 9 gig install. The video of the girls and guys was not up to par either.  No idea why some reviews and video's call this AI at all to be honest. You ask the Person 2 predefined questions and get back two predefined answers. Thats not Artificial intelligence at all. I want to ask them real question of my own. Not your questions!  I expect somethign liek this 2-3 years ago when AI and Oculus was just taking off. Right now though, I expect more.  Uninstalling because this is lame!","Sep 20, 2017 at 8:19 AM",1, 4,

It's a first direction, but you can see where this could go in the future with ai, making you think of her. Very different to other VR experiences, I'm keen to try it on a few people and see what they think.","Sep 24, 2017 at 6:19 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:50:13.337725,Jake_Veeper,Enjoyable,As a free offering it was an enjoyable experience. Its the beginning but I would love to see more things like this as the experience seems real for a first attempt. The proram worked well when I set my mic to rift in the sound preferences. True AI with questions both ways and retention of information would be a vast improvement. The actors were good and seemed real.

2022-05-28 17:50:13.353682,caj001,Hearing Impared Paramours,"Where to begin? There's not much variation in the characters. Four white characters and one African American, all in their early 30s. Secondly this is all scripted. You're asking scripted questions and getting canned responses. Thirdly the speech recognition is horrible. Given that you can only ask two questions at a time it's surpring that it's so difficult for this app to recognize what you're saying. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it was free. If I had to pay for this I'd be upset right now.","Sep 22, 2017 at 3:14 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 17:50:13.369640,Scott_2C,Well it was free I guess,"But it wasn't great. Interesting concept but like others have said, there's a couple of volume problems. First is that the audio is WAY too loud. Next is the mic sensitivity must be too low as I had to raise my voice for it to register. I speak pretty clearly without any kind of strong accent (you'd never be able to guess where I'm from) and I found myself having to repeat myself a lot, so I was annoyed most of the time. 
The video transitions were not smooth from idling to answering and back. 
The actors played roles not natural to them. Some of their responses seemed so far out of character for their personality type that it pulled me out of whatever immersion was there. 
The messaging is misleading. I expected AI, however all that's there is a series of recorded videos. 
One last gripe is that the people are almost flat in front of you and the image constantly turns to face you. So like they look 3 inches deep and the turning motion is unnatural. 
In my opionion, this app fails to do what it tries to do almost entirely, so 1 star (but not zero, it was interesting enough for one runthrough).","Sep 20, 2017 at 11:56 AM",1, 2,
