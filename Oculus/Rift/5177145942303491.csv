But this game is lacking a very critical feature of that game, it is missing the time freeze feature which is in my opinion the most crucial part of the game. in addition to that its execution is terrible with the bots sometimes having aimbot vs them not being able to shoot fish in a barrel. Overall even though it's free don't waste your time on this discount bin of a game.","May 27, 2021 at 6:17 AM",1, 29,
