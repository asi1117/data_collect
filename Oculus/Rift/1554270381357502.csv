2022-05-28 15:43:02.240581,CameronPenner,Portal meets Accounting,"A pleasant mix between Portal and Accounting. The game plays well, and looks great. I think I paid $7 for this game a few years ago, and I'd say it was completely worth it.

The ending however is weirdly unsatisfying. I can't explain my dissapointment without spoiling. But I really felt like I wasn't done. Just say ""the end"". I would still recommend it though.","Jan 2, 2021 at 11:14 AM",4, 3,

I was pleasantly surprised to play through what ended up a pretty interesting story - pieces unfold as you continue putting on headsets.

The graphics and characters are charming, the voice acting is great, and I had a lot of fun. If you like Portal or the Stanley Parable, this game is definitely for you. Just make sure to go in blind.","Dec 22, 2020 at 11:28 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:43:08.573643,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Recommend,"Nice story, good voice acting, okay concept. Gameplay- not much to it really. My main issue to the game is that it starts off as though it has lots of content- and different branching paths, they even have a literal ""wall"" of levels at the beginning with most of them being blank. 

What we get is a pretty straight forward- shortish linear story. 

Overall, it is a good experience compared to others, so I recommend it, but don't expect anything other than what I described.","May 27, 2019 at 6:28 AM",4, 4,

The promo video of a cute/fun graphical style didn’t prepare me for a “down the rabbit hole” kind of experience this is.

It's extremely well written, and there are so many layers to the game that it will keep you glued to your headset until you get to the end of the story.

Relatively short, and not a huge replay value since there's a story, but I echo one of the most recent reviewsa saying that this is someone everyone needs to experience. Good job, VVR, on getting me motivated enough to write my first review of anything in over a year of having Oculus.

If you've ever seen or played a game called ""Stanley Parable"" then you might enjoy this game.

2022-05-28 15:43:11.754136,Wildt,A little technical complaint,"I love the content, but it seems like there's a low thresold for when moving objects start updating their position from 90 fps to 45, regardless of how much performance headroom you have. My 8700k + 1080ti didn't break a sweat, and still, in some scenes the objects were stuttering around.

No game or real world experience has ever made me feel the things this game made me feel... It really does feel more like your going on an adventure through different dimensions than a video game. I'm not sure if my experience is typical but its done so well it almost makes you start to question your own reality.. I really don't know how to articulate how out of this world this game will have you feeling and don't want to give too much away.. I'll just say, download it and give it a chance, if your not impressed get a refund, simple as that. Try to not watch youtube videos on it either or anything, the less you know going in the better as the game has a lot of surprises and moments you don't want spoil by knowing what's coming. Sure the experience is a little on the short side, but it is still worth every penny in my opinion, especially since the controls are really simple and intuitive, that coupled with the amazing story, voice acting, and narrative makes this the perfect game to show VR off to friends and it is my new go to for that.

If your like me and have played ALOT of VR, Then like me you probably browse through alot of games and think they all look the 'same' and 'boring'. This game certainly has a unique feel, love the story, love the narritive. I can see why SOME people may not like it? There is no fighting or killing or anything like that. The only sad thing was that it was so short. Also there isn't any re-play value, For that reason I believe the price is too high despite the great content. 4 stars. Would be 5 if it had any re-play value whatsoever, or had it been longer.

I've played this game for an hour which, by everyone else's review, tells me I'm about halfway through. At twenty bucks for the game that's ten dollars an hour. That's less than minimum wage (I think...I've been in the middle class for a while and I may be losing touch). Fifteen to twenty bucks is perfectly priced for a couple hours of entertainment that you can enjoy again and again. Would you bat an eye at spending twenty bucks on a good movie? Look, I get it: on TV screens and monitors we've feasted on a gluttony of hundred-plus hour RPGs and bloated thousand-hour MMOs and you want the same for VR. I do too.  You'll get it! I promise! I'm old enough to remember when Adventure games ruled the roost and those little upstart first person shooters like Wolf3d and Doom were making players clumsily stumble through senseless mazes looking for key after freaking key.  No story.  No cleverness.  Just endless key hunting and monster killing.  It took years...decades, really, for game designers to figure out how to even make a good FPS, and we're in the same transition now for VR games.  Shorter is better.  I know it stinks when a good game ends early, but we're in the trial and error phase.  Most of these companies just started.  They're throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.  This?  Virtual Virtual Reality?  It sticks.  This is the most fun I've had playing a video game since Portal.  More please.  And while you're at it, bring back Adventure gaming in VR.  First person shooters don't work well in VR, but picking things up?  Combining them?  Exploring foreign enviroments as a finely stitched story unfolds around you?  Bleep yeah!","Jun 27, 2018 at 12:06 PM",5, 50,
2022-05-28 15:43:18.081213,lefthome,It might be short but it packs a lot in.,"There is a lot to absorb and explore in this game. There is great voice-acting with real personality and humour. The setting lends itself very well to the story and there are different environments to discover. 

I feel like it leaves you up to your own devices to figure out what's going on and what you have to do for the most part, so even though it is a 'linear' story, there is a feeling of open ended play and discovery. There was a point midway where I was a little lost but eventually made a discovery that opened up new avenues. 

The controls were well done and intuitive. Teleporting is quick and easy. I just wish there was more rotation options for seated play. There was a 180' turn around but it seems that's about it. and I only discovered that towards the end of the game so I'm glad my chair rotates!","Sep 11, 2018 at 10:17 AM",4, 4,

It's got a somewhat amusing Portal-like computers-gone-wrong commentary, and some kind of escape is clearly the goal, but the objectives to achieve that are so weakly defined that I felt a weird mix of being simultaneously railroaded and aimless.  I still don't really know.

After the premise had been pretty well spelled out, I think it turned more into a thoughtful puzzle game, but I wasn't really invested enough to continue.  I doubt I'll ever come back to try it.","Jul 15, 2018 at 11:26 PM",2, 7,

2022-05-28 15:43:21.217824,CarpeDmt,A masterclass in immersive narrative,"It was a masterpiece on GearVR, Daydream and Oculus GO, and it's still a masterpiece here. Only now you can MOVE, you have TWO HANDS, there's MORE CONTENT, and it's TWICE AS PRETTY! Twice as expensive, yes - but TEN TIMES AS WORTH IT. 

I'd already bought this game twice for my oculus and Daydream, now I'm buying it a third time, and the ability to watch my friends play through it on the monitor instead of just staring at them wearing my oculus go more than makes up for the purchase price. 

I will admit, the game shows it's seams a little more on PC - positional tracking was never taken into account in its design, but all it does is add to the experience rather than detract. I haven't played all the new content, but the one 'job' I did that was new, so far, seems to mess with the pacing of the original just a tad.

Still,  this is a masterclass of VR design. Take note, developers. Writing, pacing, and AGENCY - these three pillars are the foundations upon which VR content will be built forever more, and in these regards V-VR trounces the competition in every conceivable way. 

I've said it again and again - this is the best VR experience ever made, hands down, and the only thing that was holding it back before was being on mobile. It transcended that platform and showed just how much you can do with 3DOF - but now that it's on PC, all its faults go out the window.

But fact is...you spend your time either doing mindless dredge work for the AI clients ....toasting bread and throwing it, or trying to use an airblower on tumbleweeds...which does NOT work properly btw. After a few of those, then you just use your personal vacuum to suction everything up and wander around the backstage.

2022-05-28 15:43:24.356429,ADPGrommit,Shows great potential,"**minor spoilers**
So I'm going to start off by saying this game is a bit short.  For a VR game I think most of us are used to expecting that FOR NOW.  With that out of the way let's talk about what the game has to offer.  This game has a personality that is hard not to like.  The AI dialogues are unique and entertaining with satirical overtones that beg you to interact with them to elicit responses.  The art style feels sharp and the themes for each area do a very good job at setting the tone for the AI interactions.  Like alot of the point and click adventures of the past this game wants you to poke around with a ""try it and see what happens"" mentality and rewards you with actual results.  So... what is this game about?  The premise is built into the title and, as such, it delivers in spades.  I discovered alot of ""Oh wow!"" moments playing this game and enjoyed toying around with the VR mask mechanics.  One of the most disappointing aspect of the game however is what I consider the unfulfilled promise of content.  When you see the massive grid of ""clients"" you haven't interacted with yet, you expect alot more gameplay scenarios to be available regardless of how banal or unimportant they may be to the core direction of the narrative.  Perhaps I should thank the developers for not making me drudge through the craptasking but on the other hand it could have been an opportunity to further mask the true objective of the game.  At any rate what you get with this game is a new kind of exploration not seen on any other platform.  The way the developers play with the idea of VR is clever and fun.  The puzzles aren't going to be hard but they will be presented in an interesting way.  I breezed through it without hitting a challenge wall but I honestly enjoyed the journey regardless.  My biggest takeaway, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3, is that it made me think a bit differently about VR on a conceptual level.","Jun 21, 2018 at 6:44 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:43:24.372387,Duncan_Disorderly,,"When I considered buying this game, it was hard to ignore the fact that 94% gave it 5 stars and 6% gave it 2 stars. 94%. That is impressive. It MUST be amazing! So, I bought it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and all. Personally, I didn't think it was a 5 star, but a healthy 4 star. Moving around is a bit of a pain and you can turn 180 degrees, but not 90 degrees, which would be much better and save you from craning your neck. Perhaps all the glowing reports built it up a bit too much for me. I was destined to be slightly disappointed.  Guess I felt it was best to bring my review down to Earth a bit. Hopefully, you won't expect as much as I did and suffer less of a disappointment.","Jun 14, 2018 at 10:28 PM",4, 7,

Probably one of my new favorite titles, and can't wait to make this a new demo when friends come over to play VR. Lovin' it. Will also be picking VVR on Oculus Go.","Jun 8, 2018 at 11:41 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:43:33.883947,RZer0,"The most meta, fun, confusing adventure","Virtual Virtual Reality is now one of the best games i have ever played, it's filled with moments that will make you happy, confused and scared...i guess.

you'll adore the characters as ypu progress on exeapt for who know who, I think it's show how virtual reality can be taken as and it's possibilities.
Personally, i think it's worth the £11 and you should buy it 

Have fun.","Aug 12, 2018 at 3:42 AM",5, 3,
