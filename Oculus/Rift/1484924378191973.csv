2022-05-28 21:02:36.587681,PhantomWatson,Fantastic and challenging,"Having escaped from the 80s myself, I was thrilled to try this and was not disappointed. The challenges are challenging and nonlinear, the vibe is silly and fun, the mechanics are comfortable and accomodating, and I had a great time. I'll be keeping an eye on these developers and eagerly anticipating their next title.","Mar 25, 2021 at 3:36 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 21:02:36.601644,wdeswert,Fun and nostalgic!,"This game had such a great feel and atmosphere. The settings were perfect. I grew up in the 80s and this felt like I was back in my childhood home. The controls were easy to grasp and the gameplay was smooth. The objectives were not too difficult but hard enough to make it fun. Overall, this game was an absolute blast and I highly recommend it.","Apr 4, 2021 at 11:04 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 21:02:36.633559,Gray1221,Good but short,"I know some people mentioned how the puzzles were hard, but I didn't think so. They were definitely had scratching since you don't really have anything to go off of, but if you're like me and you inspect almost everything then you won't really have a problem figuring things out. Plus there's an in-game hint system, although I didn't find it to be very useful. I used it once, and it kept giving me a hint to something I already solved.

 The game is a fairly short. I beat it in a little under 2 hours, but it was fun and I enjoyed my time with it. The story isn't some masterpiece but it's definitely a lot of fun, and I loved the little 80's references. 

Overall I'd recommend it. Hoping to see a sequel eventually too.","Nov 21, 2020 at 12:23 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 21:02:39.744239,SmIlEUrDeAd6,Just wonderful,"I genuinely loved this experience. It was a really rewarding feeling when you bump stumble around looking for clues and then it just hits you. This was such a good time, and when I first realized the robot followed you around the room, I was creeped out to the point where I was anticipating some sort of jump scare the entire time. I look forward to more from these devs. For only 2 people, consider me impressed.","Aug 18, 2020 at 1:10 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 21:02:39.759199,orangpelupa,Tons of interactivity,"Good
+ Tons of stuff to grab and fiddle with
+ Have a proper story
+ Full of nostalgia (arcade machine, etc)

Bad
- Much baffling design choice (a phone that's too small for comfort, weird nav control, etc)
- No ""puzzle introduction"" that eases you into the puzzles' mindset/way of thinking/frame of logic. You must explore and think for yourself (a good thing for an avid puzzle fan tho).

Ugly
- none

The game feels like a mix of Job Simulator and Accounting+ but with way harder puzzle. Each room is filled with a bunch of objects that can be interacted. What even more surprising is the interactivity of those objects. Saw a remote control? grab it, and you can use it to control an RC car.

Basically, as long as you can get used to the weird control scheme, it is quite fun to play the main game and the various mini-games you can find from the objects cluttered on each level.

Full disclosure: I got the game for free, I also got hints from the developer. Played with Oculus Quest via Link.","May 19, 2020 at 4:22 PM",4, 13,
2022-05-28 21:02:39.792110,DarthTheMonster,I love it!,This is just what I had expected! I love all the interactivity and entertainment for this game! The puzzles are actual headscratchers and are rewarding everytime I finish one!,"May 29, 2020 at 7:07 AM",5, 8,
