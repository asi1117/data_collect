2022-05-28 17:40:15.448864,Cadash,One of the Best VR Games Out There...,"Developers, seriously you guys did an amazing job with this game. I love it so much. Easily top 5 VR games I've ever played, will GLADLY buy DLC for it or a sequel. Absolutely brilliant. The art, music, sfx, gameplay... all nearly perfect imo. This didn't make me feel sick or anything either. The 2nd level boss.... *chef's kiss*.... 3rd level boss... also *chefs kiss*....",Sep 20 at 5:18 PM,5, 9,

2022-05-28 17:40:18.614397,Shrapucino,Seriously awesome,Okay so I bought this game because it seemed cool and I had pretty decent expectations and those were passed by far no matter how good you are at these games this one makes you feel like a master from using simple combos to some stuff where you somehow get a gun in the game (You can't) you feel like you did that not random button mashing I also really love the bosses (RKD is my personal favorite) each of them feel so unique and original it feels like nothing was stolen or copied each have their own gimmicks that might take some time to learn (It took so long for me to find the boss at factories gimmick) okay now for the cons: The weapons feel like they are made out of foam sometimes. and that's about it worth at full price no matter what (Unless it takes the course of minecraft vr and turns unplayable),"Apr 11, 2021 at 4:53 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:40:18.629357,HarbingerThrace,Lots of fun! and love that it's co-op!,"Amazing that they made this game co-op.  

Really fun and very nostalgic to the old-school games, but in VR!  Love the idea, the concept, the vibe, the humour, the gameplay.  Just wish it was a bit longer, but the for price (even at full price) definitely worth it.","Feb 13, 2021 at 5:39 AM",5, 5,

After multiple playthroughs of this awesomeness, I've come to the conclusion that this tye of game just begs for MORE: 

MORE Levels.
Even MORE Environmental Kills.
Level Randomization.
Difficulty Tweaks.
Boss Endurance Matches.
Handicap Challenge Modes.

You hear that, Twisted Pixel? More of this awesomeness, please!","Dec 22, 2020 at 10:14 PM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 17:40:18.683213,Carlos-VR1,"Great Fun, Great Workout","Pros:
Great Show off piece for anyone wanting to impress their friends

Easy learning curve  Punch like you normally would, while kicks are handled with buttons,  looking up or looking down while pressing the kick button gives you the low or high kicks.

So many Objects to use as weapons, much more then any beatem up ever had!

It was fun to punch the enemies they made funny faces.  
Fun Environmental finishes,  unique to every enviroment  you get a funny finisher.

Stages why designed in a realistic way,  first stage has you fighting in a bar and its kitchen,  they did not have you going from one end of town to the other,  cuts down on VR nausia.

Bosses are full of Charisma and are fun to battle.

Game is the right length  as there are so many single player games to play in VR  with tons of different experiences  I would like to get to.

Cons
Was not able to find anyone to play co-op with !
No difficulty settings!  I wanted more enemies.","Nov 29, 2020 at 10:29 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 17:40:21.801871,akoni,its like Double Dragon or Final Fight,"PROS:
This game have potential to be the VR version of Super Double Dragon or Final Fight on SNES. Pick your character pick a stage punch em, kick em, grab them and throw em. Your enviroment is your weapon, throw em at the fan in the ceiling  or to the fire hydrant on the steet. The boss fights are great!! They are full of energy making you fight a certain way.. 

CONS:
Theres a Multiplayer mode but it doesn't work i tried CO-OP with my brother and we couldn't get it to connect at all.. until this is fix i'll give this game a 4 star","Dec 3, 2020 at 3:13 PM",4, 10,

I want to be able to put the arkanoid arcade game in my Rift house!  It was awesome to play it in VR and made me think I was in Ready Player One!   I haven't played coop but I am sure it would be some fun also!  Definitely worth the 20 bucks....I hope Twisted pixel keeps making VR as I have really liked all of their games.,"Mar 18, 2020 at 4:56 AM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 17:40:24.967405,diemensionx,fun to play,"another arcade type game in VR, like double dragon but in First person, well made game none of that cheep rubbish, great graphics, great controls fun to pick up and play, check the video as it shows what your getting. fun arcade action in VR.","Mar 24, 2020 at 3:09 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 17:40:24.982365,D-_-RAiL,Know what you are buying first.,"If you want a simple game inspired by Streets of Rage, Double Dragon and Final Fight than you will enjoy this. Do not expect some complex brawler.  Launching without Co Op is unfortunate but I get it they were meeting a deadline to meet the Stealth Launch date of the Game Awards. Some of the textures leave a lot to be desired. Which is fine on the character models but the wall and ground textures are really bland. I do really like the cartoonish character models and as intentially dumb the AI is it's still better than Espire 1.   I wish Oculus went off more than a 5 star system so I could give a more accurate score. I  give this game a 7.8 out of 10. Good. Rift S

Edit: New Co-op mode is a lot of fun. I would like for the character models to be a little more than red and blue when playing with someone else. I dont need color coding because you only see a red and blue player with only hands and a head.   I would like to see atleast a torso as well.  Other than that this game was a complete blast and you can crank SS up in this game because this game is optimised so well. This will go down as a VR classic.  New Score is 8.4 out of 10.

2022-05-28 17:40:24.997325,DaMaverick1,This is a great game! both fun / workout,"Great for Old Schoolers that grew up playing games like Final Fight and Streets of Rage. Very Easy to play for both the Younger and Older generations. The configurations are not hard, and a simple tutorial will get you started. 

I hope they add more levels in the game. So far I have not seen any bugs or glitches, I've only played the Bar level. 

It needs to have a difficulty level for those that beaten the game or just want to play  a harder level.  Other than that great game, keep it updated, and make more games like this!","Mar 14, 2020 at 7:41 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:40:25.011287,davide.croci.371,EMOTIONAL REVIEW AFTER 1 HOUR GAMEPLAY,"Being 45 years old and having started playin games since arcade double dragon saga i coudnt stop leting few tears dropin when i FINALLY saw someone bold enough to reboot this wonderfull genre on VR.
so first off all THANK YOU!
i liked the game since even before installing it,
as for the game itself, having tested it just for 1 nour, i will tell you the impression so far.
Of course is light and can run  on any rig, and seems well programmed. I didnt get any bug and everythig go smoothly and collision with punches, kicks and eney FACES are perfect :DDDDD
the feeling you breath during the fights is the right one. Im enjoying smashing almost everything around me on enemies heads and punchkick em till they get uncousciouse and then throwing em somewhere for a fun 'fatality'
yes i think developers here are on the right path to revive with style a very fun genre.
I'll be back for a more in-depth review ater ill hit 10 hours of gameplay.
but alreay now im very happy about my first wetting session of punchkicking
ahahahah way to go!!!","Dec 15, 2019 at 12:29 AM",5, 39,
2022-05-28 17:40:25.026247,IRIRI,Excellent experience!,My only critic is button mapping. I would rather be able to kick using the Triggers instead of moving my thumb from the sticks to hit a button. Thanks for this amazing game! Keep it up!,"Feb 19, 2020 at 1:27 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:40:28.114986,theregoes2,What I've Wanted For A Long Time,"Update: My arms are sore!

Original: I've been wanting a new entry in the beat 'em up style for a few years now. Not even specifically in VR, but this is really scratching that itch. The graphics are perfect for this sort of game, there are cool moves , abilities and environmental kills and it runs smooth as butter. Multiplayer is coming and that's going to be even more awesome.","Dec 15, 2019 at 11:41 AM",5, 39,
2022-05-28 17:40:28.129946,Masamune5454,Really fun title,"my guess is they took the fighting mechanic from defector and developed it further and came up with this, and boy its pretty fun. but i think its style makes it suited for online co op, and making the game revovle around online co op would be its best bet for drawing more attention. i do wish there was a little more to the combat system, though i get it, its like a vr punching game, and punching it does pretty well. i do think the oversized hands are a little wierd, but you tend to forget about them when playing. all in all its a solid punch em up game, and it needs coop and some level replayability to really solidify it as a super good vr game. but still worth 4 stars as of now, and worth a purchase for sure.","Jan 18, 2020 at 4:04 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 17:40:28.174826,Riotsu,Very Fun,"I'm only giving it four stars because I wish it had more levels, had more difficulty options, and because co-op hasn't been released yet.  For what it is, totally worth the time and will likely replay the current content over and over because of how fun the fighting is.

The art style and comedic violence is similar to gorn.","Dec 14, 2019 at 2:58 PM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 17:40:31.354322,meatballsaucey,Classics Galore,"The main game is simple fun. Not taking itself seriously this game is just simple beat em' up fun. I have laughed out loud so many times in my first play though. The environmental kills with the toss mechanic are hilarious. The mini game variety in between levels is great. Incorporating classic arcade games like Breakout, Dance Dance Revolution and Space Invaders is so satisfying. Street thugs, Roller bladers, Clowns, Ninjas, and Pro Wreslters; you beat em' all up. Replay value might be low, but I am satisfied with my purchase. Still a little confused by the tax advisor??","Dec 30, 2019 at 10:50 AM",5, 2,

Excellent old school beat-em-up combat mechanics. Hilarious environmental kills. A difficulty level set perfectly for VR. Wide variety of enemies. Excellent well constructed bosses with proper techniques required to beat. If you're in any way into retro arcades/video games like Streets Of Rage or Final Fight then buy this at once. Superb work devs, loved every retro minute of it!","Dec 30, 2019 at 6:16 AM",5, 1,

Mechanics are spot on, throw them bones and button mash for all kicks plus special power up's you dial-in then fist bumps to activate - Awesome  

AI fighters have mixed abilities not all the same moves.
Physics of objects as hand melee's laying around is good. 
Rescue citizens to free them from harms way.

2022-05-28 17:40:37.582664,Turgrodan,Great game for VR!,"I finished this game today.  It brings back memories of playing Double Dragon except this time I'm in the game!  That was a really good game.   I hope to see more games like it.   There was a bug though on the casino level.  There is a guy who perches on the wall on the side to try to jump on you.  In my game, he just perched there forever.  You can walk all around the room for as long as you like and he will just sit there indefinitely (this happened every time he appeared).   If I recall correctly, this situation may have occurred when all the other bad guys were dead and just this guy was left.  I almost quit the level to start over again but I finally figured out how to get him to jump.  You have to walk up to him facing him and then turn 180 degrees and walk away from him.  This triggers him to jump.    He seems to only jump when you are in front of him and you can't see him.","Dec 20, 2019 at 2:13 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 17:40:37.642503,TheDoomGuy,Fun!,"That's a 4.5 stars
I was looking forward for a game like this, and it surpasses my expectations.
There are a few things that I missed from the old days mechanics: 

-More difficulty levels, with this included you need to do larger combos before knocking them to the ground, now it takes only few hits, I want to savour those combos.
-The 'twister kick' should make all enemies fall BUT drains you a little energy.
-Dash attacks while running.

Other feedback:
-Why there is a marker on the ground? what is it marking exactly, it is not a center position it just tells you where your feet are and where are you looking at.. and we know that already, there is no need to have a marker, I'd like to deactivate it.
-Those hostage bombs never explode. 
-Food usually drops behind you is a little uncomfortable.
-The 'Finish him' hit makes you push kick button, that makes it unepic, what about adding an uppercut for same result? or punching with both hands at once.
-Cloud savegaming so I can resume my game from Quest to PC and viceversa.

Thank you for doing this game.
Love the title music.","Dec 14, 2019 at 6:26 PM",4, 16,

Wanted to make a video for my channel with actual game sound but it seems the developers don't even bother to fix it. This game on its own is amazing and a throwback to games like Street of Rage. BUT not able to record some gameplay with working sounds and still no fix will get this game one star.
