2022-05-28 15:30:55.804538,Kooler,A Simple VR Rythem Horror Masterpiece,It's such a unique experince and though I am sure it translates well to traditional play experience it's something so intresting in VR. Rythem Violence is an accurate description with a touch of never ending dred. You'll be left wondering what's coming around the next twisted bend in this nightmare world. I can only hope the developers release some DLC as this will leave you wanting more.,"Aug 16, 2020 at 2:33 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:30:55.849418,nonamefour,The VR Game You didn't know you NEEDED,"By far the best VR game out there. Extremely responsivie. Completely gripping. Takes you on a journey where you naturally progress. The controls are intuitive and introduction is gradual for a smooth flowing experience. 

If you want a good rythm VR game then this is it. I've got beat saber and audioshield and obviously they are different but this is a well thought out and considered game. Hands down this game can't be beaten.

I usually spend half hour on a VR game before I lose interest. This is one not to be missed. 

Also worth noting I more often than not get motion sickness with VR games so this was a gamble but actually no issue at all with that. 

Congrats on what must be the best VR game out there!","Sep 29, 2019 at 10:34 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:30:55.864378,gary.antel,Don't Buy,"This game is fatally flawed. The controls don't work half the time so you end up dying endlessly. Also, you can do the same thing 5 times in a row successfully, but the sixth time you will fail--doing the exact same thing. Why you ask? Well, the developers decided to give you no instructions/no clue on how the game works or what you're supposed to do. So you'll never find out.  And to make it more fun for you the game will endlessly loop over and over and over and over and over and over and over --with you doing the same thing that worked the first 5 times but no longer does. So you endlessly die with no hope of ever advancing . And if you should somehow, someday stumble upon the solution--don't worry, the controls will stop working and you'll die anyway. This is without a doubt the worst game I have ever played and it isn't even close. Save your money.","Sep 5, 2019 at 11:39 AM",1, 3,

2022-05-28 15:31:02.171508,funnywheeno,Sheeyat!,"This will be the best rhythm game you've ever played. Except you might not notice that it's a rhythm game at first. Everything about this game is unconventional and designed to make you uncomfortable. I found myself staring at the title screen for a solid 3 minutes thinking it was going to be a linear experience before I realized I was supposed to push a button. That means these 3 minutes were already captivating. What can I say. This game has superb sound design, polished entrancing visuals, and a flawless, fear-inducing game experience. It's like a rhythm game disguised as a continuous, terrifying, ever-accelerating barrel down a clamped down shoot of horror. Or is it the other way around? I can't decide. Do this while you're high and make sure you wear a pace maker.","Jun 27, 2018 at 1:26 AM",5, 5,

Describing it as a rhythm violence game is absolutely justified. Graphics, sound and gameplay harmonizing so well... it's almost like meditative tunnelvision.

It has been the best $8 I have ever spent. This game is hard, musical, and, dare I say it, trippy as @#$%!!! The best description of it would be an interactive Space Mountain. Don't get me wrong, the game gets incredibly difficult, but it just adds to the amount of playability. I have sunk several hours into this game at a time and am still no where near the end. If you want an incredible, music-based game that will give you a lasting experience and a great deal of replayability, look no further. This is the game for you. If you're not looking for anything like that, then you just haven't figured out it's exactly the perfect experience for vr.

If you like games like Audiosurf, Soundboxing or any type of rythmic game and you really want a challange, this is it. I can't see a game that could be better than this. I would say that it is probably the most difficult and rewarding game I've ever played, VR or not. For some reason I keep on starting games and never finsh them on the Oculus, but this one was different. Loved it. 

Tips of developers: I would pay a monthly subscription if I had to if you could incorporate real music from YouTube or Google Play music into the tracks... I can't believe a game like that doesn't exist yet. It would be a 60 dollar game or a 5 dollar a month subscription. Great job!","Dec 27, 2017 at 11:41 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:31:11.623228,AudioWasteland,Heart Pounding Fun!,Thumper is one of my favorite VR experiences. It is a rhythm based game where you navigate through tracks and dodge the various obstacles in your way. The controls are spot on and the game is such a rush. There are a total of 9 stages and the game does a great job of adding speed to the tracks and introducing you to new obstacles as you progress through each level.

2022-05-28 15:31:14.801727,berickphilip,I was on the fence but loved it,"Contrary to some negative reviews that say the gameplay does not follow the music rhythm.. it totally does. I can play the drums, so I know a bit about basic rhythm feeling and theory. In this game 99% of the gameplay triggers ARE related to the music rhythm, yes. Being in rhythm does not simply mean ""trigger during the 1-2-3-4 beats"". There's half-beats and even 1/4-beats to account for, and that is still rhythmic, and feels nice and natural during gameplay. The performance is butter smooth. The ambiance is awesome (somewhat serious, futuristic abstract stuff).

Whenever you mess up (if you are seeking for a perfect ""S"" rank) you just press L-Trigger, Down, A, then in less than one second you are back at the last checkpoint - REALLY nice!

I would be even happier if the music tone were a bit darker (as I was expecting after reading all reviews praising the music as horror-themed). The music IS nice, and a bit horror-ish, but it could be a bit darker still. All in all, very very polished game, and challenging.

Worth it.","Sep 11, 2017 at 1:12 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:31:27.417983,Drumjod,Occasional moments of bliss,"The greatest moments in this game are when your actions create a catchy drumbeat. Unfortunately, the majority of your actions end up feeling completely unrelated to the time signature and drum beat that's driving the experience. I often asked my self, ""are they intentionally trying to make the experience more difficult by placing the timing of my actions off from what could have been a feel good rythm, or do they have no idea what they're doing?"" I assume it's the former, which I feel was a bad choice.

There were some sections that I would love to play over and over as I rock to the timing and the groove. Sadly, the majority of sections feel random instead, as though the composer prioritized being tricky over writing enjoyable beats.

I'm torn between a 3 and a 4 for this game. If you prefer abstract drum beats instead of solid grooves, this might be a five for you. 

As a groove drummer, I'll still give it a four, because it held my attention longer than any other game on the Oculus rift.

Developers, I would love to see another game like this that prioritizes enjoyable beats over abstract complication.","Jan 16, 2017 at 2:07 AM",4, 7,

My go to game when I want a good seated game. Very friendly for friends to pick up level one and get sucked in.,"Jan 15, 2017 at 1:45 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:31:33.761018,Luna-NY,WTF,"I have no idea what the fudge is going on, but within minutes I knew exactly what to do.  Do yourself a favor buy a Subpac and this game and forget about any rollercoaster simulator you may have every tried and strap yourself in for an expierence.","Dec 21, 2016 at 4:24 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:31:33.777972,kt9mango,The future of VR gaming!,"Wow! I was the lawnmower Man.. NO. No. I'm more than that now.

EDIT: 
This game is awesome. It doesnt give much away at first. You have to let it teach you what to do by making mistakes. This game is obvioisly made by developers that are thinking of new consepts outside the box (or in the tunnel) for VR. Get it now!","Dec 23, 2016 at 7:53 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:31:33.792932,njco74,Boring!,Looking at all the great reviews jumped on it imidiately but I must say was pretty dissapointed by this game. After 5 mins just got bored and not worth the money I paid for. There is better in the VR world,"Dec 26, 2016 at 6:15 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 15:31:36.894636,OMGninja,Buy it! love this game,"this game is simple  but yet super fast the music goes really will put you in combat mode lol... I hope they make more games like this, Way Better in VR!!!!","Dec 25, 2016 at 12:36 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:31:36.910594,r0b1nw,Congratulations to the devs,For crafting a brutal yet beautiful granite and steel masterpiece so compelling that I actually put down my beloved touch controllers to play this. Not normally my cup of tea at all but have been following this since it was released and hoping the VR version would meet expectations. Blown away by how good this is.,"Dec 20, 2016 at 6:23 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:31:36.926551,ClamSauce,,"This was by far the best game I played on my friend's PSVR and I bought it as soon as I saw it was available.  This would be a great game with or without VR, but the VR adds another level to the already high tension.  If you even kind of like rythym games, just buy it.  It's so different and unique.","Dec 20, 2016 at 6:06 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:31:36.944503,Aquareon,Woooow.,I was skeptical whether this would really be worth $20. Just based off the screenshots and what I imagined the game to be. Consider me blown away.,"Dec 24, 2016 at 11:08 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:31:40.046207,anakanemison,Really good.,"An intense, visceral experience. Reminiscent of Dyad. The visual style is effective and unique. I'd love to see more visually abstract VR experiences like this. I wish the far-off, presumably large objects in this game felt bigger though.","Dec 22, 2016 at 1:23 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:31:40.062165,spinache,Masterpiece,"Unique, perfect and crazy rythym game. Top 3 best games in 2016. Probably best VR game for me and i have 90% of the Oculus library. The real challenge start at level 3.","Dec 29, 2016 at 2:31 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:31:40.093082,WesleySnipers,Deserving of my first review!,"I have to say that this game is really special if you have ever played or been very close to music.  It is intense, but in a good way and once you find the rhythm it is almost like calm within the storm :)","Dec 21, 2016 at 12:17 PM",5, 0,
