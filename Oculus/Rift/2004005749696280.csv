2022-05-28 18:44:28.274959,theRealeNSyn1,Best VR game yet!!!,"Absolutely, without question the best VR game out. So realistic, that I'm not really sure if it is a game, or, if I'm actually controlling a cyborg, somewhere in remote Russia, doing the dirty work for God knows who. The only improvement would be to make it full blown Fallout 3, with RPG style upgrades to character. It is also more terrifying than the so-called ""scary"" games... By far.",Jan 27 at 12:12 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:44:28.289919,mrddixon,Rough Gem,"[updated] This is a horror/surreal survival game, taking place in an apocolyptic aftermath enviroment.  This is an indie game, and it brings with it all the pros and cons of that label.  It's beautifully weird and does some inovative things, while being rather rough around the edges and a bit jank at times.  The graphics and sound do a decent enough job of setting the lonely atmosphere, but they're nothing special.  

I feel like comparing the game to Saints and Sinners with its dark tone and similar gameplay loop. S&S is more of a streamlined approach, with this game leaning  more realistic.  I mean if S&S and ITR were siblings, S&S would be the cool sexy one that everybody (rightly) wants to hangout with, while Into The Radius is like the weird intoverted artistic one who gets more interesting the more you get to know them even if they do smell a little musty and are kind of a drag at parties.

If you have a penchant for survival games, this game should be on your radar, especially if you thought Saints & Sinners was a little light in the loafers in that respect.  If you're into bleak landscapes and weirdness as well, i would highly recommend.",Dec 6 at 10:37 AM,4, 32,
2022-05-28 18:44:28.305876,Thundertaker82,"I actually like this game, but ...",The latest patch has meant the game no longer loads for me on my GTX 1070.

The exploration and combat are superb, with just the right mix of atmosphere, solitude, action, and dread. The controls and performance are great, especially since the 2.0 update that just came out.",Nov 7 at 11:24 AM,5, 18,

2022-05-28 18:44:31.475399,SmileyMann,This game is a must have,"If you aren't into horror or thriller genre games I curiously beseech you to set that aside for a couple of hours and give this game a chance.
It's one of if not the best vr title available right now.

Having said that, this vibe in this game is so oppressive that it's genuinely overwhelming.  I got back with my first sniper earlier after finding it in a crane (that was quite a friggen trip) and I had to call it because I literally could not go any further for today.  I genuinely love this game and everything about it.  Need solitude?  Well this has it in droves, the first thing I wanna do after getting out of the radius is go talk to somebody and feel human again for a little bit before I go back in.

You're completely alone and that can be pretty rough especially in vr.  The atmosphere can quickly become overwhelming.  To the point that you'll be jumping at every little sound.  I know what I'm saying sounds awful, but that's what makes it so wonderful.  This is a work of f*****g art and I can recomend it highly enough.",Sep 11 at 1:54 PM,5, 22,

This is without question the most detailed AAA VR game ever made. There is simply no way anyone can argue against that once they play this. Absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this game.

The detail with the guns, maintenance is fantastic. It borders on survival sim nicely. Overall a great game that doesnt hold your hand.

Has a fallout atomshere but with a differen't science fiction catastrophe. More focused on survival and scavaging than story.

2022-05-28 18:44:37.817436,tomas_kim,"Iron man, real difficulty recommended","There is Iron man option in this game
And It makes game 100% difference and worth to play

Every single item you pick up in radius will be alternative gear for next try if you go die

Additional items are useless when you pick save&load system
Because you are going to sell every alternative item you pick up
You only need Most useful gear because you can reverse time whenever you want
It makes this game more lesser immersive

Just do ironman with realistic setting
You gonna drop everything on K.I.A site and some of them even won't be there
Then you are going to find best alternative gears in your house
and you will attempt get back dropped items as best as you can
With this mechanism, you are going to make decision how much take risk with unexpected die for getting not guaranteed reward 

High risk, High return make this game get good gameplay experience

And I hope there will be patch for collision issue when dead on not plane area
I think some of item i drop stuck in wall or underground, it can not be scanned by trigger button (Maybe It is normal or my misunderstanding)
If it is normal (disappearing of items) on ironman
Please let the players know that ""dropped item on dead can be disappeared""

I can't wait to play Into the radius 2.0

I bought this game on steam store and oculus store both
I hope developer getting nice time
Thank you for watching",Jul 1 at 4:56 PM,5, 14,

2022-05-28 18:44:40.932107,VRponch,A rough diamond,"If you liked S.T.A.L.K.E.R then but it!
The game is CREEPY AND HARD even on story i had to save every 3-4 minutes like in the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R .  I realy felt lonely through the game and the cassets were a joy to find and listen to, makes you feel less alone. i wish the hub area had real humans. like a merchant, gun smith, commander to give you missions. 

im so happy the devs update this game regulary it's improved a lot! it's still not a 5 star but were getting there!! if you like S.T.A.L.K.E.R buy this game!!!","May 9, 2021 at 11:54 PM",4, 19,

2022-05-28 18:44:40.963023,Lonewolf5599,A hidden gem err... Artifact?,"Given I don't have the longest experience with this game I wanted to write a review considering I believe I've experience the basics. Into the Radius is the best exploration VR game I've played so far and I think it will hold that throne for quite a while the only one I could think that might rival it is Asgards Wrath but I think this one tops it. 
   Chest rig (update): the rig now has less slots although it makes the game a little more simple and some slots are dedicated for certain items which is nice. they also fixed the rig movement to the head which fixed my biggest issue very nice.
   Map: Its BIG honestly I didn't expect it to have so much in a game that's not finished yet, no complaints.
   Gameplay: I have yet to discover everything involving gameplay but I have to say its fun I had no issue getting immersed in the beautiful environment and the different weather patterns kept me on my toes the different enemies are unique and sometimes terrifying.
   Conclusion: I wanted to hint at what this game involves because I believe people should experience it for themselves in my opinion this game is amazing I can't wait to see what comes next! I will add more to this review as time goes these were just the thoughts off the top of my head.","Sep 24, 2020 at 1:15 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 18:44:40.978980,Lonewolfe343,Spooky Fallout,"I've never played a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game before so the best way i can describe this game is the Walking Dead Saints and Sinners meets Fallout 4/metro exodus. Really cool game, and quite challenging (in a good way). i brought it down to a 4 becuase there is no easy mode a i keep getting SNIPED BY SPIDERS. please make an easy mode so that new players can get into the game. its not fun dying every 4 minutes, also i dont love how expensive it is to repair something, i found a sniper but i cant even use/repair it because to repair it is nearly as much as buying a new one out right, maybe make repair costs 50% the cost of the item","Jul 24, 2020 at 1:01 PM",4, 21,"Thanks for the review and feedbackLonewolfe343, we're glad to see you are enjoying the game!"

My Initial Impressions:
This game has come along leaps and bounds since I last tried it over a year ago. This is an early access title and the developers have been busy adding new content.
This game plays more like a survival sim than an arcade game.
I still think the game has some way to go, and I'm still not a big fan of the graphics, but it's getting there in terms of content.","Jun 12, 2020 at 12:56 AM",3, 8,Thanks ParadiseDecay! We really appreciate the support and review! The release will have lots of improvements and polish for you to check out :)
2022-05-28 18:44:44.102626,DQGlizzard,Love the game! Keep up the great work!,"This was the first VR survival horror game I thoroughly enjoyed! I've never had a good creeped-out feeling like the one this game gave me. The VR market currently lacks good games of this genre and caliber!

Things I like:
- Realistic gun reloading, handling, and firing.
- Unique storage system. As close as it can get to real life.
- Best survival mechanic out there. Scavenge for food to keep your stamina up, because without it, you can't run away from the monstrosities that await you.
- Best and some of the most terrifying enemies any game has to offer. From people that appear to be other survivors but are really creatures with guns somehow grown into their hands, to fast, scurrying spider-looking things (BTW my favorite!) that make eerie static noises as they get closer...

Things I would change:
- Vest storage system. It feels bad when you reach for your knife and end up grabbing a mag. Maybe make things a bit more spaced out on your vest? Or have specialized holsters for items like your knife on your hip?
- Grenade mechanics. I probably spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to use the grenade, until I ended up shooting it with my PM and ultimately killing myself. Maybe make an in-game tutorial on how to use it?
- Some missions may require more hints and tips. 'The Harvester' mission, for example, I'm still stuck on. When I get close to photograph the anomaly, it won't let me take the picture. I've tried everything, from shooting the little floating orb around it (which just deflects the bullet regardless of the orb location) to just lighting it up with everything I got. Nothing works! 
- Some areas on the map, things just get way too clustered. I've only been able to explore the southern half of the map, but it seems like an area to the west of the main road to the south has electrocution anomalies everywhere, making traversing the area more time- and health-consuming than the actual mission itself. And an area off to the east of the southern portion of the main road is an area where distortion anomalies and white circles clump together so tightly traveling across it is suicide. Not sure if any of this is a glitch, but if it isn't, PLEASE make it so we can customize what kind of anomalies we want and how far apart we want them, or at least a difficulty setting.
- Some glitches were encountered, but that's almost called for in an early access game. The most prominent were the ones that made Spawns get stuck in some objects, like walls, when they tried to jump-attack you, and one where I ejected the magazine on my pistol to reload it, but instead of grabbing the falling magazine, I grabbed the pistol with my other hand, and the physics caused the magazine to go flying into high heaven. Very costly, especially when we're talking about a $500 OC-33 mag! There is also a glitch where the item you are holding can get stuck on walls, and if you don't get it unstuck from the object, it will go flying from your hand, never to be seen again. I've only seen it happen with pistols, but I have to say the physics are also to blame on this one. The last annoying glitch I've frequently saw was a glitch that allowed artifacts to spawn inside of electrocution or distortion anomalies.

Sorry the last part got kind of long, but most of these don't make the game annoying enough to stop playing it. Some of the glitches can be very annoying but can often be prevented by taking things slow and steady. And even then, I shouldn't get too picky, because it is still in early access. But overall, great game! I look forward to seeing this game grow up to become the AAA title VR game it deserves!","Mar 27, 2020 at 1:24 AM",5, 18,"Big thanks for the review xPhoenX! Great points made here, we've been considering how to best implement difficulty levels into the game, we'll look into those bugs you reported as well thanks.
