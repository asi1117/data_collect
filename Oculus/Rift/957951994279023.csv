2022-05-28 14:30:34.796024,DoppGanger,A brilliant Mech Game for VR,"Pros: 
Customizable loadouts for each mech to fit your playstyle
Physics
Engaging combat
Beautiful graphics
Fluid controls
Sound and Music 



Cons: 
Multiplayer game with very small community (this will change with the campaign+quest 2 release!)
Lack of incentive to keep coming back aside from having fun (let's face it, we like chasing after something, whether it be for unlocks, titles, cosmetics, or any sort of achievement to reach).  

Final thoughts: The fun factor is already there, its a very fun game, its just lacking a player base and a reason for players to keep coming back. However, with the campaign and quest 2 release coming, I'm hoping this game gets the recognition it deserves and we get to see this game turn into a true popular live service VR game!

2022-05-28 14:30:34.811981,TheJackOfNoTrades,Some of the most fun I have ever had!,"I will not be able to describe how good this game is, it is truly a masterpeice in terms of fun! 

I heard about this game about 2 weeks ago and waited to research it. All of a sudden its getting a quest port and its cross buy so I imeddietly open up my oculus app, buy it, and start up Revive and... HOLY COW ITS GOOD.

This game ticks all the boxes for a great game its got fun and uniqe gameplay, awsome visuals, a soon to be added campign mode with a full story, cinimatic combat, weighty and good controls, and immersive nature! It amazing and I really appriciate what the devs did here.

I can really only judge multiplayer rn as the campign drops on March 3rd

But I will say the multiplayer is... AMAZING!!!!!!! I cant say much but ist just so much fun and the lobby  I got in was full of kind and welcoming people who were happy to talk and teach me some basics!

Either way BUY IT NOW!!!",Feb 26 at 1:16 PM,5, 4,

The controls were a little difficult initially but once you get used to them you understand the beauty of the physics.  You pilot a large battle mech where you really get a sense for the large mass of it.  There seems to be a good amount of strategy involved as well.  Highly recommend.,Sep 22 at 9:56 AM,5, 14,
2022-05-28 14:30:37.996067,Phantexim,"Best use of VR to date, needs content.","I have played many VR titles since I purchased my CV1 and this is by far one of my favorites. The controls feel natural and are intuitive, and the immersion is through the roof. 

Further thoughts: 
1. The customization is bare-bones, but effective at allowing for different playstyles. 
2. The playerbase is great, but small.
3. PvP is fun and engaging, but I would be interested in seeing some sort of campaign.
4. Super immersive.
5. Great sense of scale.
6. Has a great aesthetic that makes it feel more grounded.

All in all, I believe this game has amazing potential and would highly recomend this to any person who's ever imagined piloting a giant robot. Would give a 4.5 if the site allowed.",Jul 11 at 12:08 AM,4, 16,

You are taking said mech using joysticks in a Virtual Enviroment that feel like you're riding the Willy Wonka bubble machine. Or if you've ever driven a bobcat, it feels like that. Push this, turn this. Pull on the good ol train handle hanging on the upper right for a honk. Grab a radio to communicate with your team.  Well, I am giving it three stars because they did a good job at coding how to drive the mech. I can be aiming (with the headset center being the aim) and grab a joysticks in the enviroment seemlessly. I always look because I'm just used to other experiences where you actually look at the thing you're supposed to be ""grabbing"" and find you're not actually grabbing what you think you would (Like a gun in a holster.) I'm impressed that I can grab the joysticks without looking at them. However I don't care for blowing up people in multiplayer over and over.

2022-05-28 14:30:41.194620,GUNGHO917,THE worth successor to MW games,"With almost 370 hours in, this game has me coming back for more.  The weapons are varied, well-balanced, and each require a certain amount of practice to master, and so are the GDR/Grinders, which can equip varying amounts and types of weapons.

VR tracking with the Oculus Rift HMD is spot on, and the controls make you feel like you're something between a pilot and a truck driver.  Some GDRs respond quickly to movement controls, but lack firepower and armor, and you will definitely feel the weight of the heavier ones, although heavily armored, you will struggle to maneuver them around the map, as expected.  All limbs are removable, but don't let a lost arm or leg let you down.  Lost limbs, in addition to lost armor plates, give the pilot advantage of reduced weight, which equates to MORE maneuverability.  Soar to new heights with your crippled GDR! :D

The weapons at your disposal aren't far off from MW games I grew up with.  They come in different classes, from small mounts, to extra large mounts.  Some GDRs can hold certain types, and weapons vary from explosive cannons and missles, to lasers, rail guns, and the Vox equivalent of a shotgun.  Ammo is no concern, but heat is.  Heat management can mean the difference between getting out of the fight alive, or shutting down and being a sitting duck to your enemies, long enough to cool down or get blown up.  And if you find yourself high on heat, your GDR is a weapon itself, too!  Throw your GDR at an enemy.  Collision-based damage is a popular way to take enemies out while keeping your weapons cool and ready for the next volley.

The physics is very convincing, and the sound was recently upgraded to feature spacialization.  Music and special effects are very good.

The community has been wonderful, and the devs are active and open to suggestions in their Discord server.  It's unfortunate that many negative reviews were left, despite the game showing much promise and potential.","Apr 17, 2020 at 5:01 AM",5, 36,

 It's multiplayer only, and with there already being a glut of multiplayer mech games it's nothing special.  It urgently need single player content if it's want's to succeed.  Include single player content then it's a instant buy.","Apr 8, 2020 at 2:46 AM",3, 33,

The game does not instruct you in an intelligent way to understand the action needed to move on. The slow action is so much in disarray that I always get dizzy and get a headache.

Being in the cockpit of a HUGE battle mech is amazing. They give you just enough gadgets and doohickeys to grab and swivel, Hell there is even a horn! Yes its as loud as you would imagine! And Dont be worried if you think it will be to hard! Its so simply done yet they make you feel in control so well. I mean it its easier then driving a car! Haha. The battles are intense, you can do offline bot battles and customize a lot! For example you can make 3 teams where its 5v5v6 because 16 mechs is the max but still thats more then I thought they would do! You can choose a mech from about 7 diff bodies, and then go further and choose weapons and such.

2022-05-28 14:30:50.613301,Maroszek,Long live the mech (er...grinder)!,"So this is true and true a mech (er...grinder) game.  The grinders have a slow plodding motion that feels like you're moving a large robot of destruction acrosss the map.  When they collide (both physically and when they shoot) they FEEL like they're giant warbots tearing into each other with no finesse and only one purpose...to rip each other appart.

There's a TON of opportunity here too as it's early access and they'll be adding/improving.  Of course it's easy for me to suggest...e.g. don't let pilots auto-eject so if they die in the cockpit you get a bonus score and they take longer to respawn, etc. but I'm not the dev's (or a programer) so I'll just rely on their good judgement...which has been pretty outstanding so far.","Dec 29, 2019 at 3:15 AM",5, 3,

I find this game incredibly simplistic, slow and monotonous. The whole heat-management scheme is terribly conceived. Noone wants to have their mech clam-up in the middle of battle for 30 seconds to cool down after firing off a few rounds. There are other ways of limiting ammo-usage besides simply halting gameplay. The physics are set to such a slow pace that gameplay feels like walking in sand. I have other issues but those are the two deal-breakers for me.

I was very disappointed that you have so few controls in the cockpit that you can and must use. But thats exactly the point where VR can show its strength. I want to use the knobs, levers and displays in the cockpit. Whats about an emergency cooling system? An extinguishing system? A switchable optics system? At the moment the gameplay has not enough depth for me and the advantages of VR are not used enough. But that doesnt mean it cant be done.

Customization options are okay, you can outfit your style of mech with a couple or a few different weapons you can choose from.
Gameplay modes in terms of variety are pretty good, I love the salvage mode.
My only problem with this game is that it doesn't have enough people playing it so finding a game with people will be hard, however, that being said, you can always create a lobby yourself with your own prefered rules and add bots.

This game has a large number of chassis to choose from and nearly unlimited ways to equip them. Want to customize your own personal fast-moving, jump jetting sniper mech? You can do that. Wanna build a heavily armed behemoth with missle racks and cannons for front line combat? You can do that too. Just remember to balance for heat. Nothings worse than waiting for your systems to cool off while you get hammered by enemy pilots.

The in-cockpit controls are amazing and very easy to use once you get used to them. You nearly forget you are NOT sitting in a giant mech . It is the most immersive mech experiance I've ever had. Simply awesome. 

It is almost perfect. All I could ask for is perhaps a few auxiliary equipment slots to add a little more depth to mech load-outs. Some countermeasures, perhaps? Smoke screens? Shields? Repair kits? And a single player story driven campaign would have been nice, but we are talking about a game that costs $25 at full price. I understand the developers had a budget and a limited niche market to sell to. 

I still cannot believe I had never even heard of a game this awesome. Here's hoping they find a way to optimize it enough to sell on less powerful, more market share HMDs like the Quest and PSVR.

Im a great fan of immersive mechanics like that, and hope they add more - Headlights for really dark cave systems and wires with grappling hooks to trap a fleeing Hopper etc. As long as you have to reach somewhere and flip a switch, or toggle a button im happy.

Effects are just right. Smoke, debris, and parts falling off after those cannon shells hit the target. Dustclouds, lightning and other environmental effects help making the maps get their own very distinctive feel, and the battles feel chaotic. 

I look forward to more grinding noises and vibrations when you crash into other mechs. Wrestling with another machine of that size should cause a bit more chaos to really stress you. Same goes for really critical hits.  I would suggest sparks inside the cockpit. Alarms going off (that you can mute with a switch of course), and random stuff falling around you (like pieces of the interior falling behind causing a racket). Maybe grab that fire extinguisher to your right to take out a fire in the cockpit?
Physics is actually a thing as well, and it quite possible to use your mass to push other mechs in close combat, which is nice. This is probably something that can be explored further, with classes even more equipped for tanking and blocking enemy assaults.

This game got so much potential. With a few more ""classes"", maybe a few support mechs being able to repair other mechs, and another one for defending and shielding I can see this being a great competetive game.","Mar 1, 2019 at 7:34 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:31:06.397540,HamletXV,Imperfections aside...,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !

CONs: 
-If you dont like big giant ""slow"" battle mechs to fight exclusively in multiplayer... I would say you probably wont like it.
-The bots. not very smart to say the least. They get in the way, they lack of tactics, get stuck, they crash on your mech and they are an easy prey during multiplayer combats. They are not a buggy hell, they are just ""meh""...
-Not a lot of players around :,(
-Needs more stuff: Maps, weapons, gameplay mechanics, modes, etc. IT NEEDS MORE PEPPER XD!

PROs:
-few players+bots surprisingly makes it more tactical sometimes, as you need to cooperate and move with your team and ""use"" bots to your advantage while destroying those from the other team/s. (you can play solo/no-bots etc. but it feels meh... and your team needs you!) 
-You love Mechs? ""slow""-but-""faster-if-you-get-to-drive-them-well"" heavy semi-steampunk ones to operate manually through gritty handles?
(not those shinny kanji evangelion ones in wich the robots just replicate your moves...Im joking I like those too XD, dont get me wrong...)

Think more of a future giant mad max robot that feels like operating an old truck/train made for near apocalipse war XD)...

You like Battletech? Mechwarrior? oh boy you are gonna love this....

-if you want to try a VR game where you can play seated,no need for room scale, in a Big war machine with full cockpit control (you are the pilot, not the robot!) with a fun voice com system for crazy team vs. team gameplay, blasting big robots, evading incoming fire, planning through giant jumps where to take cover and quickly decide who to shoot before a bullet-hell ravages you, drowning in excesive heat as much as it can handle before locking your controls for cooldown (careful with this, you become an easy target XD hide and/or turn off the engine for  a few seconds) loosing limbs, refusing to eject untill you can destroy as much as posible, then eject before getting blasted & back into field to make your team win...

2022-05-28 14:31:06.413498,VagabondVillain,Best Mech Sim in VR,"When I was about 8 years old, I got my first introduction to the benefits of PC gaming in the form of Mech Warrior 2 on windows 95. Compared to everything I had experienced on the genesis or the snes, Mech Warrior 2 felt so profoundly next level and I've been a proud member of the PC master Race ever since. About 20 years later, I'm happy to say that Vox Machinae gives me that same feeling of awe that I experienced as a child. 

This feels like next level gaming. As much as I enjoyed Archangel, I now feel that this is the definitive Mech combat game for VR. The balance of the mechs and the customizable loadouts are all very well done. It takes a bit of getting used to but the motion controlls are a joy to use. Some may prefer to play with a game pad to increase their response time but while I appreciate that this is an option, using the touch controllers is so much more fun. Theres nothing more satisfying than oblitering an enemy grinder with a well placed rocket barrage, then taunting them by blowing your horn trucker style. (you actually have to reach up and pull a cord hanging above you). 

On the other hand the game could benefit from more customization options as well as unique cockpits for all the different mech types. Since the game is still early access, I wouldnt be surprised if the devs add this down the road. That being said, this is now one of the games that I use to show off the Rift to friends and family and it's a must buy if you enjoy mech sims.","Dec 16, 2018 at 5:05 PM",5, 28,
2022-05-28 14:31:06.429455,The_Third,Ohhh this game is CRAZY!,"I was like you (probably), reading trhough the reviews and thinking that this game was maybe okay, but not AS good as people are claiming it to be.

Oh BOI was I wrong!

STYLE
The steampunk style of the game is the first thing I really noticed and how different from the Hawken, Merch Warriors and other Merch games of our epoch. Not everyone is fan of  the steampunk style, but this should not stop you from trying this one. It brings a unique vibe and most importantly it reflects in the way you control your Mech. 

CONTROL
This is where the game shines the most IMO.

The controls look and feel ""analog"" in the sense that you almost feel like driving a car. Push that lever, pull on that button, pull the horn handle :)

Pretty soon after the tutorial and after a few online games, you will realize just how INTUITIVE the controls are. Your hands will find the controls by themselves and rare are the moments where the controls feel awkward with the touch controllers.

This is the first time I am so immersed in a VR game because the controls feel right.

GAMEPLAY
I recommend to develop your piloting skills a little bit on a server with bots. However don't linger there too long, as you will truly witness the tactical aspect of the game on a populated server. Each Mech class has a unique playstyle.

CONCLUSION
This game took me by surprise. I bought it driven by pure boredome and discovered a VR game I really intend to play often (Pretty rare I can tell you).

You must know however that the play population is a bit low, like most of the multiplayer VR games, but so far the people I played with were pretty awesome.

I could continue like that for a while, but let's keep this one ""short"". If you were ""thinking"" about bying this one but not sure, give it a try.

Also, I started my little dedicated server ROBOJOX-US-EAST if you're trying to find a server to start.

When I was playing MechWarrior 2 on my 486dx2/50, I never in my wildest dreams thought that there would be EXACTLY THAT in VR 30 years later.  We have big, lumbering, heavy mechs. Heat management is important. Limbs can be blown off. It's all very similar to MW2.   The controls are all in VR and are really fun to use (provided your real life chair has arm rests).  Initially, I didn't like the virtual controls but they really have grown on me.  Also, there are bot only & local LAN only matches!

The touch controls are spot on. I can't think of anything that would make this more immersive without going out and building a full blown mech yourself!

My only complaint, if I have to give it one, is the lack of a single player campaign or multi-player co-op campaign. It's all battle mode... there is no back story or storyline.

2022-05-28 14:31:19.127555,Polyphonia,Great game!,"Played over 2 hours in my first session itself - and that's a lot considering it's VR. The best thing about this game is that you can sit and play. That's how it enables you to have longer sessions.

Now to the game itself - it's a mech-sim multiplayer shooter with incredibly realistic physics. For example with rockets - you can't just aim and shoot - you have to anticipate the trajectory of the missile as well as the position your opponent will be at. It's very tactical. There are around 6 different mechs to choose from with an endless variety of weapon loadout combinations. It's best to try out a bunch of different mechs / weapons and see what suits your playstyle best. 

One thing that happens often with multiplayer VR games is low server populations which leads to declining playerbase. I'm glad to say that's not the case with this game. Lots of people to play with (since it has cross platform enabled between Rift and Vive users - and this game has gained a lot of traction) as well as the game fills empty spaces with bots if needed.

Overall, a really solid VR game if you're a fan of mechs, tactical gameplay and realistic physics.

Update: Now after having played countless hours on this game - the only reason I'm giving 4 stars not 5 is because of the occasional crash and a few minor bugs. But since it's Early Access it can be forgiven - but still 4 stars for now. If at final launch all of these are sorted it's 5 stars for sure!","Nov 11, 2018 at 7:43 AM",4, 5,

The game itself is well made and I like the concept of walking around in a large mech Warrior. The cockpit layout is adequate and the controls work okay but can be a little clunky. Using thrusters is very confusing in terms of control. All these things can be lived with. Where the game lets itself down is playability.
There seems to be only one game mode and that's online stomp around destroy the enemy. There's not strategy, no side campaigns, no offline mode, no other things to do. Just join game, destroy the other team. It's a bit limiting and I suspect will get tedious very quickly. Walking around doesn't give me that sense of controlling a large heavy beast. Scale is a little off and the sounds are not immersive enougth, where's the eject animation and what's the deal with shutting down when you overheat. That's a real buzz kill. Sure shut the weapons down but I still want to move and feel like I'm in game.
I think with more things to do in game, different missions, different campaigns. A better set of sounds (where's all that hydraulic and piston action), improved graphics and a feeling of lugging a heavy beast around it would be a better game.","Oct 20, 2018 at 4:58 PM",3, 6,"Hi there DogTailRed2, there are some quick things I'd like to clarify regarding your feedback.

I was never really a mechwarrior game fan so this is suprising.
Only suggestion is to advise everyone that you MUST install to an ssd drive because mechanical drives just will not do the job.

The physics do feel floaty and the inverse kinematics could use some tweaks, but it's a great experience.

The controls, levers, knobs and other displays and monitors are really neat. I forget sometimes that I'm at home and not inside a giant robot.

It also runs super smooth with my GTX1070 and I7-7700K.  The potential with this game to build Mechs, weapon loadouts, etc is tremendous so i really hope the developers can run with this thing!

The grunginess of the mechs, the shaking of the earth with each step, the loud thunderous blasts as you sink a full clip of flak cannon shots into an enemy mech and watch huge metal sheets of his armor (and maybe an arm and leg shear off).

The controls and immersion of this game really makes you feel like you are in a giant mech.  Everything is well though out, from the CB radio for coms, to the design and role of the mechs.

This is a must have game for anyone with VR.  Everyone with a VR headset should own this game.  It's a must have!  While its early access, it plays like a polished game.  I can't wait to see what else they add.

Gameplay is slow as you have to micromanage every movement and it makes the pilot think about their actions rather than act on the whim. I found the tutorial nice as it was fast and gave you the overall idea on how to operate the mecha. I LOVE how communications works in the game. To talk you have to take hand off the joystick and grab a walkie-talkie, there is no time for ussless chatter. 

Now, I'd love to see some customisations added to the game, where we could edit our cockpit and perhaps change the 'AI' voice, maybe even edit the look of the robot.

What it lacks is weapons, mechs and maps. The choice is to limited for me and I don't know whether to refund and see how the game progresses.

I was an avid Mechwarrior 3/4  player back in the day, sinking countless hours online playing competitively but what that game had was the ability to heavily customise mechs with a vast aray of weapons and units, which for me was what kept me playing for years. 

This game, while good doesn't have the options that would make me want to play the again and again, which will be it's demise unless expansions are on the horizon.

The walkie talkie voice communication system is also a lot of fun to use and enourages me to talk more than I would in most other games.

I wish there were even more little things to interact with in the mech cockpit, maybe headlights, windshield wipers, bobbleheads, switches, radio, etc. Just little things to make the environment feel completely interactive. I noticed that there are some bars you can hold at the top on the cockpit but they don't seem to do anything.

I also think further avatar customization could be a nice addition, beards, hair styles, hats, glasses, etc. A good progression system of cosmetic mech skins and pilot outfits could probably help this game stay active for a long time.","Oct 1, 2018 at 9:36 PM",5, 2,

Extremely immersive and really interesting interface system, in fact so good if HOTAS were to be introduced, it would be a bonus but the game is also really fun with the current control system with the touch controller. 

The game begs for a single player campaign or some sort of narrative direction, it needs a bit more structure, however having said that, in spite of the lack of the latter, it is definitely worth its money, in fact it's one of the most compelling titles to date on Rift, as far as I am concerned (and I'm not a huge fan of mechs usually). Well done!

It would be a 4 star because there is room for improvement, but the game struck me as so bloody cool that I HAVE to give it full marks. If they add customizable mech content and a campaign or better objectives, I wouldn't know how to find all the stars it would deserve. 

This is a three-man team, and that considered they've done an amazing job. If I were at the top of the Oculus direction, I'd be donating extra staff to work on this, it could be huge.","Oct 8, 2018 at 1:31 AM",5, 0,

That way everyone has the exact same opportunity as everyone else- no vets destroying noobs with a crazy advantage.

Caveats:
No single player campaign, and hardly any players online, but the offline death match with bots is more than worth the price.  

Hoping for more mechs, weapons, skins, maps and mechanics (such as heat sinks and deeper loadout options)... in other words, the game is awesome and I hope to see it invested in and fleshed-out.

2022-05-28 14:31:53.883303,sebrk,A winner (but please devs look here),So here I am playing perhaps the greatest game made by mankind. A true evolutionary milestone. But then suddenly the screen goes completely black. Oh no! I still have sound but everything is pitch black. Now I do admit taking a potion beforehand. A certain OpenTPCast. Hey! Don't you blame me. I want the lots! All of VR. Complete freedom. I hope it one day includes this marvelous game. Until then I will investigate why the screen turns black and if it is OpenTPCast or the game itself.,"Sep 29, 2018 at 8:47 PM",5, 0,

Instead I found a surprisingly polished, fun, well designed, unique experience. Well worth the price if you are on the fence.","Sep 29, 2018 at 9:46 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 14:31:57.007549,Ransurian,"Weighty, satisfying mech combat","Vox Machinae gets so much right as a weighty, simulation-esque mech combat game. Battles tend to be relatively slow-paced, especially with heavier mechs, and a ""go-it-alone"" attitude is often severely punished thanks to 16-player servers in which wandering into an enemy team invariably leads to a swift, merciless death. Aiming feels solid and isn't ever twitchy, even with Oculus Touch controls. At the time of writing, several of the game's many servers were full, leading to some intense 8 versus 8 battles.

Vox Machinae sports multiple objectives across a variety of maps, and the loadouts of the game's healthy variety of mechs can all be customized, leading to a great deal of replay value. The game rewards tactical, team-based gameplay and team communication, especially during domination or salvage missions, and failing to coordinate and communicate properly can lead to lopsided losses against competent enemy teams.

Visually, the game looks great, especially when it comes to lighting on certain maps. The game runs buttery smooth, even on my GTX 1060 6gb. The audio is similarly fantastic, with a gripping, distinctly Terminator-esque soundtrack that's chock full of synth.

Special praise should be given to the game's unique communication system. Whenever you pick up your radio to speak to your team, your avatar is displayed on a monitor in each teammate's cockpick, and there's even lip sync. In addition, whenever you destroy an enemy mech, your AI assistant will actually call out the name of the enemy you killed (although it isn't perfect). All of this adds a hefty layer of immersion to an already immersive VR experience.

This is, without dispute, the definitive mech combat title for VR and one of the best multiplayer VR experiences currently available. Even if you're iffy about mech combat games, give this a shot!","Sep 29, 2018 at 8:15 AM",5, 0,
