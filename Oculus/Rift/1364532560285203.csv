It's an absolutely wonderful party experience, but this 5 star review applies only to the game with all the experiences available.

2022-05-28 15:48:38.664810,Skellington25_,Wont' even start.,"No matter what I try, this game and only this game crashes as soon as I start it. I see the splash screen with the Turtle Rock logo, and get a fatal error crash on my monitor. Too bad. Gear VR version was neat back in the day, wanted to play the better looking version. I don't seem to be the only person with the problem either. I understand it's free, but I paid for this and all of it's expansion sets on gear VR. None of that is here. That doesn't have anything to do with the one star review though. One star is what a game gets when it crashes on startup. Everything else works fine. Can run Blade and Sorcery on max 60 fps.","Mar 23, 2021 at 11:53 PM",1, 12,

The party compatability factor alone is more than enough reason to download this. Honestly, I wouldn't have downloaded it for $5 but after playing it and using it to introduce my friends and family to VR it's worth 10 easy BUT IT'S FREE!! so do yourself a favor and download it before the devs realize they could sell this game

The bad...it's still in development so there are only 4 scenes of about 7 minutes each...that's it I just wish there was more content because it's so well done","Mar 16, 2021 at 6:46 AM",5, 12,

All jokes aside, there isn't much to it but it is enjoyable for what it is. Be great to show someone VR who has never tried it as you don't really have any controls to get used to. Just sit back and let it roll and enjoy this creepy little experience.","Feb 18, 2021 at 11:44 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:48:48.164402,Squid3958,What's not to like?,"Great ""game"" considering it is no cost to you.
I use quotation marks because it's not really a game, it's more an experience. You just watch what happens with no real way to interact or take action, which isn't a bad thing. It's kind of an immersion horror film if you will.
I'm sad to see that the second release takes a different direction actually, and goes with a storyline which requires interaction.
If they churned these out every couple of weeks and sold them for a reasonable price, I'd be on it like blue on sky.
Not really interested in slogging through another tedious step by step story line.
Give me more of the creepy, jump scare experiences this first episode presented!","Sep 12, 2020 at 3:30 AM",5, 10,

The Review No One Will Read!,"The quality of most of the models seemed fine, but the little boy in the ad-picture had sharp edges and what looked on painted on skin and clothing. It made me feel like he was less real then everything else, and not in a spooky way. If they up the quality of the child in the picture, I'd have probably wet myself. Good experience otherwise.

I was gravely disappointed to discover these new Experiences aren't for the original headset and I hope the developers will listen to their fanbase and port those Experiences over. This is my first and (so far) only review with the sole purpose of bringing to light an issue I hope the developers intend on rectifying. Either way, what we do get with Face Your Fears is 100% gold and I want to congratulate the Devs on creating such iconic Experiences for the forefront of VR. To readers of this review: don't listen to those saying these Experiences aren't worth it, just remember these are Experiences and should be treated as such in your contemplation of their worth; I guarantee if you sit down and jump into Face Your Fears, you'll stand up with a new perspective on what VR can bring to the entertainment scene (especially for the horror genre).","Jun 23, 2019 at 4:33 AM",4, 7,

Had the rift for over 2 years now and to me it seems to be not worth the money i invested in it as well as upgrading my PC to run it.

Same with the bedroom fear... it makes you feel scared, which is impressive.

The ""game"" (I say ""game"" even if this is not directly interactive) clearly deserve 5 stars.
However, for me, it's loosing one star because of the lack of content.

2022-05-28 15:50:26.219141,dawsonp2003,Exceptional Realism,"The game has two ""areas"" to go to

The first one is for what I believe to be if you are afraid of heights. It is short and not very scary in my opinion

The second area on the other hand, is extremely scary. There are three diferent books you can do and each is different. The first is light as a feather, and basically it is almost like a poltergeist and every drawer and door is opening and closing with voices and a jumpscare at the end. The second one is The ghost, the spirit of mason. It is basically a gollum like thing going around your dark room with glowing eyes appearing in scary places and another jumpscare in the end. The third one is fun with Jingle, The friendly clown. It is basically a doll that is a clown going around your room and scaring you. There is also a jumpscare in the end as well.

I give this game 5 stars because I got it for free, and got scarred for life. I enjoyed it and was happy I got it, if you want to see me play it, visit our youtube chanel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5mdKiOZK5h4Q0zGK1lvfQ","Jan 9, 2018 at 2:40 AM",5, 1,

I first felt it when I teleported to higher ground in Robo Recall and my brain told me to take a step back from the edge.

Then I downloaded this and stepped through the left door...

A few moments later, my feet grew roots as my brain shouted at me: ""DON'T LOOK DOWN!!!"".
""It's OK, don't freak out!"" I replied.
""THIS IS NOT OK!!... AND STOP LOOKING DOWN, FFS!!!"" he wailed...

(FWIW, I'm not afraid of heights, just the usual fear of the sudden stop at the bottom.)

2022-05-28 15:51:45.391384,Likumo,good scares,"I give it 5 stars because it actually got me some.  I played horror games like any other game when I was 5 or 6 years old (hasn't changed much.)  I tried out the ""kitchen"" demo that the ps4 had and it was a bit of a joke imo.  I tried out all the ""horror"" scenarios that this had and it had some jumpscares that got me a little.  I didn't scream or anything but I did get some goosebumps on the ghost one.  I'll still sleep soundly tonight but it actually got me a little.","Apr 16, 2017 at 5:41 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:51:45.408338,tonyfromsyracuse,BRAVO!!!,"I didnt think there was going to be a VR showoff demo that rose to the level of the dreamscape one with the T-rex demo but in particular the door to the left
with the robot was quite frankly genuis and VR at its best!! on a side note....I wish VR designers would give us enviroments we can walk in and just enjoy at our leisure......for instance the beautiful brightly lit apartment unit we find ourselves in, is actually very therapeutic for me who suffers a bit from seasonal affective disorder.  its rainy and snowy alot here and its so wonderful to find myself in a brightly lit apartment looking out a nice big window into a sunny enviroment. if only I could walk around say a whole house and exist in that enviroment when I choose, say on a snowy day or night. I think that should be a strength and an avenue I wish more VR designers would create.because standing in that apartment facing that huge window....NICE.  sorry for the side rant, but this demo is amazing!","Apr 14, 2017 at 10:28 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:51:45.426290,Bel-garath,"Needs more variety, but a good demo","I enjoyed the height/robot scene, that was actually pretty cool. The bedrooms scenes are a bit redundant to me and a bit slow. I wasn't scared in any of the scenes....but I'm sure if I showed my mother or those friends I have that jump easily, they might be. This needs more variety. I was expecting more different types of scenes with more different types of fears. I guess the fact that it's free, well....I can't complain lol.","Apr 16, 2017 at 10:30 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:51:45.444242,flashxz,Creepy and cool,"It's free too. I hope this animation studio/ game company can make full games cause from what i experience so far is darn good. 
The giant robot scene was awesome to witness and the room part was too creepy and intense for me to get through in one sitting. It creeps me out even when i know it's just a game. Amazing visuals and atmosphere. I just have one complaint, the physics and particle effects on the robot scene could be improved. Like when the giant robot fell down the building, the impact felt  weak. 

It is not very interactive but a cool experience for the VR.","Apr 14, 2017 at 4:07 PM",5, 0,
