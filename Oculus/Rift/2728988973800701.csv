2022-05-28 20:42:01.548968,Drawhen,plus one more star compared to quest2,If you have played Lone Echo or HL Alyx games like Batlesisters are only a huge disapointment.... even the PC Version of Battlesisters is not worth the money. It´s seems like with such games VR is like playing PS2 experience in 2021. Unfurtunately not recommended from side. Update 2022: since the last update my savegame disapeared. So minus 1 star.

2022-05-28 20:42:01.585869,davitral217,Not sure what the negative complaints,"I've owned an Oculus since 2020. I've played several games on the Q1 and now I have a Q2 and a gaming laptop to play PCVR games. Of course, for my first PCVR game, I had to get the famous Half Life Alyx. The game really got me excited to play VR again and after playing it was hard to come back to my Quest games. I tried buying games and playing but quickly got bored and returned them. When there was the weekly deal or whatever. I saw that Battle Sister was one of them. I'm in a few Oculus groups on FB and as long as I've been in them no one has ever talked about this game. I am not sure why. I never played Warhammer or anything like that. And I've been impressed. To be honest, I thought the graphics were pretty awesome. I can't wait to see them using my PC. The gameplay is just enough to keep me entertained. I'm only on Chapter 4, but I like the new weapons and power ups. I'm enjoying myself and the battle fights. This is one of the best games I've played in a long time.  It's no Half Life Alyx or Walking Dead but for what it is and as mentioned never played Warhammer it really is a good game. I haven't played horde mode yet. I look forward to it. My only wish is that that game adds a co-op campaign. And even adding 4 person horde mode. Please, continue to update this game.

Visuals on PC are good for the most part, audio design is decent, and the voice acting is top notch.  Guns feel good to shoot, faith abilities are fun when they work properly, and movement is fluid.  Environment interactions are okay, and I like the QoL features for item pickups and ammo management.  The story is standard fare 40k nonsense and isn't going to win any awards, but it should be enough to keep your attention.",Feb 15 at 3:27 AM,4, 1,"Glad to hear you enjoyed the game!

2022-05-28 20:42:01.621773,ShocksVR,"6-7 hrs of fun, looks better on PC","6-7 hour fun singleplayer shooter
First off, I'm not a fan of 40K Warhammer, I bought this to play as a singleplayer VR shooter; so no 40K WH bias here. But as a whole, this is a pretty decent game. Looks great on the Quest2, looks even better on Link/AirLink (Rift) [yes, this is a Crossbuy title].

Overall, if you're looking for a FUN, lighthearted shooter (this is NOT a milsim, so those players plz move along), that features a mix of hoard/wave shooting, unique boss fights, and getting engrossed in the detailed game environments, then this is a game for you. Very much recommend, especially for those looking for a fun/arcadey shooter.",Dec 12 at 12:06 PM,4, 22,
2022-05-28 20:42:04.752400,SuburbanFox,"Excellent fun, especially for 40k fans","If you're a 40k fan, chances are you've seen enough of games that cast you as space marines, so playing as a member of a different faction for once is a refreshing change.
The story mode is fun, and although the majority of enemies will be chaos cultists, demons of Khorne, and Word Bearer marines - I'd possibly question whether a Celestian should be able to kill chaos marines so easily but I can let that slide because it's a game - there are one or two surprises which I will not spoil. The weapons feel more or less as you'd expect them to, and feel good to operate; I personally would have let the player have some time with the chainsword before handing them the power sword, because as it is, the chainsword isn't worth using by the time you find it, other than for the fun factor of seeing how it works. I also feel like the lasgun and storm bolter rounds should move faster than they do, but this is minor.
Horde mode is even more fun, but very unforgiving (it takes a few goes to last more than a few waves - but then it'd be no fun if it was too easy!) I haven't tried it online yet as there are apparently still some issues, but I'm sure these will be ironed out eventually, and I look forward to teaming up with people and fighting the enemies of humanity together.
Actually being able to put yourself into a 40k battlefield is great, and killing a chaos marine with the power sword is very satisying. The environments are impressive and all look very 40k, and the use of a space marine chapter that isn't the same old done-to-death Ultramarines suggests that the writers have quite a bit of knowledge of the 40k universe... in short, I love this game, and it made me want to explore the Adepta Sororitas in greater detail (I've always been an Eldar player but now a new army may or may not be on the cards... ;) ).",Dec 17 at 2:44 AM,5, 10,

2022-05-28 20:42:04.783317,EumenesofCardia,It's good but seriously held back,"The gameplay is good but what seriously holds the title back is technical issues and QoL issues. The game isn't broken by any means but expect to be constantly frustrated grabbing items, reloding, drawing weapons, using faith abilites etc. it just comes across as a game that tries to look triple A but under the surface is barely holding itself together 

That and honestly the graphics for the flamethrower is basically layered orange squares like its 1995, i get the devs wanted to add it in since it's a SoB game but good lord does it stand out

2022-05-28 20:42:04.798277,kweeky,No difficulty settings,"It's 40K, so it was an instant buy, but it's immediately apparant this game hasn't been anywhere near any QA testing (except the first level). There is no adjustable  difficulty which in 2021 is insane. 

The jankiness that permates through the game is so bad it just becomes a chore to play and when a game is a chore to play, an arbitarily hard difficulty is the last thing you need. 

I wanted to like this game soooo much, but I just can't recommend it at all (and I have an incredibly high tolerance of low quality GW licensed games). The graphics are bad, which would be forgiveable because of the setting, but then the  poorly balanced gameplay just outright prohibits you progressing and enjoying it because when you are dying over and over on the 2nd level, any small semblence of fun you WERE having quickly diminishes into a bitter review like I'm writing now.

The one redeemable aspect of this game though is it's locomotion. It really nails smooth locomotion, it's a pity the main gameplay loop is so whack.

Update: I'm editing my review to 3 stars as the developers seem to have addressed the crazy difficulty spike on Level 2. My earlier review still stands though, difficulty settings are needed and would help soothe out the janky combat, in particular the very orky ballistic skill the protagonist seems to have.",Nov 14 at 9:51 AM,3, 4,"Sorry to hear you had a negative experience with the game, we are hoping to add alternative difficulty options down the line but we have existing updates and content were hoping to get out the door first.

(meaning you have to try and do everything twice) Don't even get me started on the combat they shoot like 5 melee enemies coming while 5 more with guns are shooting at you, along with like 2 of thoes big red robot things and also like 3 of thoes fly things that shoot like acid at you, SO unless your like a 200 year triained fighting war good, its pretty close to impossible. You constanly have to reaload and all of the guns ammo run out so quickly. The story line is actually really enjoyable but not really with the constant difficult fighting and stuff. They give you 2 compainons which do ABSOLUTLY nothing besides look at you in the middle of a fight unless your charecter has to PHYISCALLY lead them to the enimie in which the fhight is already close to over. If you die the checkpoints are so freaking spread apart so you have to do everything AGAIN and you'll just proably die again and have to go over it again.

2022-05-28 20:42:07.953837,revnance,For the glory of Emporor!,"Ive been a fan of the 40k hobby for only 2 years now and Ive always loved the Adeptus Sororitas, even though I dont have any of their models. I originally wanted a Oculus quest 2 specifiaclly for this game because when it was announced it looked like a really great step for the future of WH videogames and just Tabletop to video game in genral for isntance imagine a MTG RPG in VR its still a card game it just fully embraces the rpg elements of the TCG, or even a DUngeon Dice Monsters game. the future of gaming is still limitless even more so than ever and games like this are a great example of where the industry is headed

This game specifically is one of the few first person warhammer games Ive played until Dark Tide comes out. the controls are great and the devs did a great job on making sure you feel like a warrior of the Imperium its amazing! even if you arent into 40k I highly recommend at least trying this game out. now Im waiting for some one to make a Spcewolves or even Necron VR game.",Jan 7 at 3:15 PM,5, 1,"Thank you for the positive review!!

2022-05-28 20:42:07.968797,Goblin_King73,Good but  needs update,"The sound scape needs work. Everything sounds like its right behind you (sometime they are) When they are infront of you. I keep spining around trying to find out where the noise is coming from.
Also as other have said if you could duck (via button press) taking cover in fights would be easier.
Also I still have no idea how the rosary works. It seems random if it works or not.
All the above can be fixed with an update or two (I hope) so they should fix it soon.

That said the backgrounds are great. At the start you are in a monastary ship and I really like the detail to the background. I also like the dialoge. ""I'll assume shes short with white hair"" love it. And I get a lasgun. Was afraid they would scoff at it. They do in game but still use it. Most accurate weapon in my exprience.

Once you kind of figure out the best starts and weapons the game can become easy real quick but it was till fun, with satisfying weapons and such. The only reason it's not 5 stars is due to the janky checkpoints, forgettable story, and buggy multiplayer mode, (though yes it's technically in early access).

2022-05-28 20:42:11.101418,Allerka,"Not completely worthless, but almost is","TL;DR - Inferior to Space Marine in almost every way, despite that game having come out a decade ago. Not worth the full price, but if you REALLY love 40K, try it out on a sale with low expectations.

I suppose for a first attempt at a 40K VR game, this could have been a lot worse. It's definitely cool to finally have a game focused on the Sisters of Battle, and there's a certain satisfaction to mowing down Chaos Marines and cultists with a power sword and bolter in VR.

That's about where the good ends, though. The controls are clunky at best, and tracking is inconsistent. Weapons randomly fly out of my hands, trying to hit targets at more than a dozen paces even with a two-handed grip is nearly impossible because the guns constantly shake, my melee weapon only blocks enemy fire when it feels like it, my sword sometimes passes right through enemies without actually damaging them, and trying to climb ladders is a laborious process because I keep randomly losing my grip and falling off. And before the devs try to blame my unit, I promise you I don't have these issues in any of the half-dozen other games I play.

The graphics are straight-up terrible. Muddled textures and boring level design makes it look and feel like a game from a decade ago. Even Space Marine from 2011 looks better than this. The sound isn't much better. As others have reported, it constantly sounds like stuff is happening behind me when it's actually in front (again, not a problem I have with other games that use positional audio). The dialogue from enemies is horribly repetitive, most of them only have a handful of lines at best. The voice acting of the main characters is decent, but that's about it. Stuff that SHOULD have sound effects, like a Space Marine walking around, doesn't.

The gameplay, while somewhat fun, can quickly get repetitive. My weapons and ammo isn't tracked between levels, which also kinda sucks.",Aug 19 at 6:48 AM,2, 3,

2022-05-28 20:42:11.146298,zogtrog,My review of the main game,"After the saving bug was fixed I have now played through all the levels and completed the game. The graphics, and music create a great atmopshere within the game. The game play is straight forward, consisting of picking up weapons and ammo, and firing the weapons at baddies. There are a few levers to pull to open doors and fuses to remove, but the puzzels are very simple, which lets you get on with the action quickly. The final boss battle was a bit of a dissapointment and this should definetly be toughnened up. Sometimes it is best to hide behind a wall and let your buddies  do the fighting as they are indestructable. The game is definetly worth the money if you are a 40K fan.  The dreadnaughts are by far the most dangerous enemy as a few shells from their weapons can kill you more or less instantly. Sometimes enemies spawn right on top of your position which is unfair, especially if it's right behind you. I would have liked to have been able to crouch down behind things to avoid fire.
Here is a list of minor bugs
If you back track to certain areas you have already cleared then then all baddies respawn, but ammo does not. If a plasma pistol explodes on top of you a weird section of floor gets created mid air that lasts for a few seconds.",Jul 10 at 5:01 AM,4, 10,

2022-05-28 20:42:14.254984,Ultimeas,A Fun Campaign,"My original review was 1 star as the game would not save progress across both the Quest 2 and Rift versions.  The developers replied to me that they fixed the issue, and I finally had enough time to play the game start to finish this past week.

The only experience I have with Warhammer (talking only about 40K in this specific review, but have played multiple Fantasy games as well) is their video games.  Space Marine, Deathwing, etc are all of the lore and world building I know.  I however absouletly LOVE the 40K setting, and it fasincates me.  I think the environments look pretty great honestly, considering this was seemingly developed as a Quest game first.  I am VERy grateful I waited for the PCVR version of the game, as I played it at 1.4x Quest 2 resolution and 120hz and it looked and played great (9900k, RTX2080, 32GB DDR4).  I encountered a few bugs here and there, but most of the time had a smooth experience throughout the campaign.  I only had to manually restart to a checkpoint once in the penultimate level, as I teleported beyond a barrier I wasn't supposed to.  

The Battle Sisters are a really cool part of the universe that I'm glad I got to meet, but would have loved to had them fleshed out a bit more.  This leads to the first of my only two issues with the game.  Its not quite long enough.  I actually don't know how many hours it was start to finish, but I felt some of the deaths and twists in the games would have had MUCH more impact had we gotten to know the characters involved much more thoroughly.  However, this being a VR game and knowing that games are very expensive to make these days, I understand.

My other issue is with the boss fights.  The levels themselves can be very hard, and take a bit of strategy and fast thinking.  The bosses however are VERY easy, and quite anti climactic (especially the final boss).

Overall I'm glad I got to play througn it!",Jul 25 at 8:05 AM,4, 3,"Dear Ultimeas,

In Chapter 7 specifically, some of the encounters can easily cost you 15-20 minutes of progress due to poorly thought out checkpoints.  If any devs manage to read this, you really need to add either a story mode that smooths out the difficulty spikes or at the very least add about two more checkpoints between each one over what you currently have. I'm shelving this one until it gets more updates.",Aug 7 at 5:02 AM,1, 1,"Dear DaggerFecal, Sorry to hear you've been having trouble with the difficulty of the game.

2022-05-28 20:42:14.300861,Raviolimonster,"Loved it, but took time to love.","This review is primarily for the campaign, the combat bugs I list aren't in Last Bastion mode.

First Impression: The tutorial level was cool, it took a minute to get use to controls but eventually I got moving just fine. What blew my mind was what followed: After the tutorial is an absolutely gorgeous walk through your character's order's base but that beauty is an exception. While the story is in 'combat' the general aesthetics drops to 'functional'. 

After a few levels I realized that the campaign levels seem to struggle at times requiring a restart to progress or combat bugs (the killing shot from a gun on an enemy will not have a visual effect from the gun/enemy death can be delayed). The explosion effects are bare and fire effects are... not what you'd expect. 

Gameplay wise there is a little tug and pull between wanting to be a cover-heavy sharpshooting experience (enemies are too accurate for this playstyle), or a fast paced arcade shooter complete with explosive barrels to shoot. With current gameplay bugs and the melee weaponry's handling, it can sometimes feel more like pretending to be playing the game. This shooter excels with its large bosses, I wish there was more of them.

My suggetions to the developer (which I include because it looks like someone from the company responds to comments, which kudos to y'all! <3 That made me think about these suggestions as I played the game).
I would SUPER suggest having a haptic feedback/buzz when melee weaponry registers as hitting an enemy. 
If there isn't already (I realize I didn't check), create an option to disable vibrate when hovering hands over holsters, it felt constant and distracting.
If possible please make the sword's bullet deflect range larger, with the most common gun being small, fast, and hard to see it felt more random chance than intentional to deflect. 
I have more suggestions but am running out of review space. Is there a good channel to post them all?","Jul 1, 2021 at 6:45 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:42:17.390597,Masamune5454,fantastic sci fi romp.,"this game far exceeds my excpectations. 
first the gunplay is fun. its got a manual reload system where 
you drap said clip into the gun from your belt. you have to wait a second after tutorial for it to let you do it. it seems they added it after launch. i would love to pull the bolt back too but you cant. im just glad they have the option. you can still drag your gun to your hip to reload, and hold two guns and shoot and reload, or you can go one gun, both hands on the gun, and manuver it like you would in real life, reducing recoil ect.
weapon variety seems good, and theres also pretty good melee combat.
some quick negatives, i wish it was more visceral, as the guns seem less powerful than they should feel. and while swords chop and hit enemys, theres no stabbing or slamming the axe into them deep. its not too basic, and not too... unbasic lol
all in all i really enjoyed the first two levels, oh you also have a great campaign and some kind of bracelet that gives you force push power, and im assuming more as i proceed. luckily they also didnt go the whole my vaj is strong route.
what im saying im a man, and i cant stand femenist crap being shoved down my games. well this game has none of that. its actually the perfect depiction of strong wemon. the only time they mention that they are is when they refer to each other. strength shown through action not word. this game did that and more right.
all i can ask is for some more polish, maybe more weapon interaction and deeper combat, also why are the candles there, you cant light them... maybe throwing weapons would be fun, or throwing mags to stun the enemy or weapons to knock them out for good.

2022-05-28 20:42:20.557128,Blastorama187,Broken,Objective items dissapear at checkpoints forcing a level restart. Get stuck on the floor and can't complete objectives. Sometimes your weapons vanish when you load a checkpoint and you have to go without for a while. Progress gets stuck randomly forcing restart. Not fun. I ended up deleting it. Waste of money. Oh and part of thel level didn't load once and i fell through the floor. Also somehow the crates open crooked sometimes and get stuck. I don't know how they messed that up it's so simple.,"Jun 16, 2021 at 4:50 AM",1, 2,"Hey, sorry to hear about the issue you faced with our save game function, we have now resolved this issue in our latest 1.1.1 update.

2022-05-28 20:42:20.573085,Abnthug,Not really impressed with this,"So I bought the game at launch on Quest 2 platform, and while I appreciate the updated poly count, the game seems to play worse. I did some Last Bastion gameplay and reloads were completely busted, game was unplayable and it's a reoccuring thing that has happened everytime I've play the PC version. It just feels even more clunky and frustrating. I hope they sort this out soon because there is an enjoyable experience under the bugs.","Jun 4, 2021 at 4:13 AM",2, 3,"Hey Abn, sorry to hear about your experience in the Last Bastion early access mode, we're aware of and working on addressing the issues you called out here to make the playing experience smoother as we move out of early access into full release."
2022-05-28 20:42:20.588045,Slurpy7,Fantastic Gaming Experiance,"Im not one to review but this deserved one. Just good fun and one of the best games i have enjoyed playing. 

I see complaints about 2 handed weapons, i have never come across a game that has done that well. 

Quick draw works perfect. Can understand this may be trickier on the quest due to field of view.

Strafe and fire is a blast!! Please make more.","Jun 9, 2021 at 12:54 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:42:20.604003,RedDeadMonkey,Feels like a mobile game.,Softlocked myself in the beginning of the game. Gameplay is way to simple and boring. Enemies Ai is basically not existing. Audio is... Not great. And there's quire a few Bugs...,"May 28, 2021 at 8:12 PM",1, 12,

2022-05-28 20:42:26.945042,TemplarGFX,Good fun but very unpolished,"This is a simple and fun games with decent mechanics and good gunplay and swordplay.   Unfortunately the game feels very unpolished.  For example one of the sisters has hair thats missing a transparency map, so you can see the black of the texture that is supposed to be see-through, and having white hair its super obvious.  Giant Space Marines make no noise when moving.  Enemies only shoot at you, not the giant Space Marine next to you.  I often got stuck on terrain pieces.   There are boxes that are on the ground, but you can't kneel down to open them.

still a good fun time though if you like 40K",Jul 23 at 5:34 PM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 20:42:26.960999,GladiatorRising,Awesome game,Battle sister is alot of fun despite the few bugs one will run into. The devs are great at communicating on their discord and are working to fix the bugs. Hopefully we get more co-op maps.,Aug 11 at 9:59 PM,5, 1,
