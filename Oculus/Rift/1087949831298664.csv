2022-05-28 14:55:33.343658,Soulsea,Took away all the good stuff.,"This sequel is a totall bust, there is not really any parkour, you cannot acheive the high flying crazy jumps without hooks, and the story line is mediocre. You spend all your time going back and forth on paths that you have already traversed a plethora of times; these paths however are quite gorgeous and the graphics of the game have improved since the first(hence the three stars rather than 1).","Jan 2, 2021 at 12:16 PM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 14:55:33.388537,thoiter,Mostly great.,"There's not much room for criticism, but the game sometimes ""cheats"". By this I mean that you can spend a lot of time and effort manuevering into a position where you know you're easily in range of hooking a bush, only to be left unable to attach to it, presumably because the devs don't want you to take that route.
If i'm in range I want to be able to attach my hook, anything less is down to poor level design and is very frustrating for the player especially at critical points in the game.","May 6, 2020 at 12:18 AM",4, 16,

It just isnt very fun.  The levels are poorly designed and there is no direction to the game.  It is fun to swing around for a little while until you come to a point where you are hanging from a green thing and there aren't any other green things within reach of your grappling hook.  So fall into the lava, respawn, rinse, repeat...

I don't know what I am supposed to be doing, or why I am doing it.  Just swiging around trying to get to these goal markers which seem to be just out of reach of any of the things I can swing from.  The whole thing seems kind of pointless and the average playtime is about 8 minutes before boredom sets in.

2022-05-28 14:55:39.724295,YoavReisner,Multiplayer is broken,"** I am writing this review after asking for help on the Windlands 2 forums on steam and being ignored by the dev **

To be honest, I don't know how the game is. Might be great. 
My friends and I bought this game wanting to play together, as this is supposed to be a great coop game. However, when we tried to connect together the game not only did not let us, it did stuff which are unacceptable. 
For example, one time we were trying to connect and it kept us in an entirely dark waiting screen forever. Probably got stuck. Eventually I had to kill the game and restart it to try again. Between getting stuck in dark loading screen, or none-dark loading screen, nothing work. 
One time somehow one of us managed to join the other, but it was only one time, and even that time the 3rd player simply got stuck trying to connect every time. Usually we couldn't even connect 2 people to the same place. 
We are long time gamers, we know our stuff. This was hell, and after around an hour we gave up. I gave the devs the chance to help out, but it doesn't seem like they care. 
Anyway, if you want to play alone, this might be a fun game, sounds like it is from others. If you want to do multiplayer, I would recommend to avoid this game.","Sep 11, 2019 at 3:13 AM",1, 2,"Hi YoavReisner,

Both Steam and Oculus use the platform's multiplayer services and we can confirm these do work for each individual platforms, however firewalls can cause issues, we don't have any actual servers, we use a method called punch through that uses Oculus, Steam or our Own Servers to facilitate connections peer to peer.

Our own cross play service is in beta and occasionally has issues, I can confirm it's working as I write this, and I hope you don't experience problems going forwards, if you do find an issue we do have a support form http://support.psytecgames.com and endeavour to fix issues quickly."

2022-05-28 14:55:42.851930,taquitobuddy,"Great movement, not so much the rest","First, the swinging around in this game feels fantastic once you get the hang of it.  Really cool.  The graphics are also basic but suit the overall game style, and the music is relaxing.  There's a big world to explore, solo, coop, race, and collect modes.  On the cons side, combat is extremely basic, boring, and often frustrating.  Also while the world is huge and looks very nice, there is no map, and the waypoint markers are essentially useless.  There's a difference between exploring and wandering around lost, and this definately falls into the later category.  A map or optional guide line would have made this so much better.  Overall, pick up the first one for a much lower price, as it is just as good as this one if you just want to swing around and relax because there's not much else worth doing.","Jul 18, 2019 at 2:07 AM",3, 8,

2022-05-28 14:55:49.156068,CarloFromMilkyWay,The second best gaming experience,"... after Windlands 1. 
Windlands ""1"" was exhilarating, frustrating, fulfilling. At the end of a level I felt exhausted and trembling, but truly happy . Sometimes I had to take off my vr headset for the fear to fall down. This game is better in many ways: the graphics, the story, the addition of a very easy to use and spectacular bow, the structure of the levels. But it is not fun as his predecessor. He misses the sense of magical vertigo that had the original. It is however a unique experience, which makes understand what VR can give compared to traditional games. In these days it seemed to me that is slower than some time ago, as if it were not optimized for my gtx 1080.","Dec 24, 2018 at 11:17 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 14:55:49.171028,tonyfromsyracuse,not as beautiful as the first Windlands,"I was suprised to see how short and lacking in level design there is. you fairly quickly see how it somehow pales compared to the first Windlands in beauty and replayability.  if only the game looked like the store avatar for WindLands2. quite frankly while you are initially impressed with there are far more swinging trees, somehow the game just doesnt seem to have the replay value the first one did. you begin to miss those breathtakingly high platform goals. and the drab and dreary look of the new game world gets to me, and somehow....looks more hazier than the first WindLands which looked like heaven itself. this one however the sky looks like a boring hue and drab aqua. yes there seems to be more features such as NPC's afterawhile it gets old with the constant reswinging over already treaded ground. back and forth, back and forth you go it seems always after some diamond shaped yellow distance marker which dissapears inconviently at key moments. this game is another case of how sometimes when something is upgraded in some areas, it gets downgraded in others. notice my thumbs up is grayed out so no one can agree? interesting","Dec 8, 2018 at 11:09 PM",1, 13,
2022-05-28 14:55:49.190976,Fortytwoish,"Frustrating bosses, lazy quest design","Just quit at the fourth boss.
You are required to fly around constantly, otherwise you instantly get hit and die. When the bosses use their laser beam attack with little to no hint, you also probably instantly die.
Hitting anything with the bow while flying is nearly impossible without aiming for a second or two, which is time you need to find the next spot to grapple to. So all bosses - for me, solo - went like fly in, fly up, shoot a bit, die, repeat.

It didn't feel satisfying to beat bosses this way.

The fourth boss is especially bad because the target reticles don't turn blue on its arena's grappling spots, making it even harder to grab on to something in a split second. I also wish there were grappling length (or any) upgrades. But maybe they're still coming?

-------------------------------------

As for the second point: You're being led in circles constantly, very noticeably. And while the gliding itself is the best part, it gets old fast. It doesn't help that the story itself is nothing special. 

Loved the first one, thought combat was a genius addition, wish it was executed far better.","Dec 8, 2018 at 5:38 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 14:55:49.207929,M-Hanzo,"Fun, but nothing like the first game","I'm giving this game 5 stars because it's fantastic fun that I do recommend, despite the problems I have with it. 

In the game, you're playing a ""Guardian""; a warrior who defends this semi-floating civilization from a robot invasion using grappling hooks and a bow. 

Having just come from Windlands (which I really like), I'm a little bummed that this sequel is so different. The style, objectives, mechanics, and even lore all seem entirely unrelated to the first game (are Titans still a thing??). The biggest surprise came with there being characters--part of the original's charm, I found, was how desolate and empty it was, and the addition of characters (pretty cheesy ones, at that) kinda snuffs the world's mystique.
I was also annoyed by the weird running/jumping mechanics. For some reason, if you fall from a higher distance, you sink into the ground (up to your neck), and spring back up. And everything is super ""slippery"" too. Once you pick up running speed, it's pretty hard to slow back down in time to avoid sliding off a cliff :P

On the bright side, the environments are just MASSIVE compared to the first one. Plus, you're given a whole lot more to do. It feels far closer to a full game than the first one (which felt more like a jungle gym), as well. Not to mention the music is great, and certain environments can be intensely atmospheric. Most of (if not all) the problems I have with the game are directed towards its being a sequel, opposed to a standalone game. If this is your first time playing either, once you overcome the motion sickness, you'll have a blast.","Nov 29, 2018 at 10:33 AM",5, 4,

The second installation does not disappoint, as a matter of fact it adds a lot to the formula that made the first one the standout title it was.
Playing in multiplayer feels like another level and the levels are even more beautiful than before.

2022-05-28 14:55:52.327586,SwashBlade,Improving on an already good original,"Windlands and Windlands 2 were both on sale a little while ago so I picked up both.  With the original game completed but not really leaving much of a mark on me I waited a bit to start this one, not wanting to burn myself out.  I needn't have worried - the gameplay varies from the original significantly.

The biggest difference is the addition of enemies and a bow and arrow to combat them.  The enemies vary from simple one-hit kill beasties that shoot back at you to complex ""destroy each weak point to trigger the next phase"" bosses that you'll ideally fight while swinging around the arena rather than standing in place.  The shooting is straightforward enough and the nature of bow and arrow use in VR means there's a satisfying level of skill in it - adding the hookshot swinging into the mix just makes you feel thoroughly accomplished when you pull off a clutch weak point hit while soaring through the air between anchor points.

The swinging, the mainstay of the original game, has had a few welcome upgrades as well.  Level design gives you well defined hookshot highways for getting from place to place, with visible destination markers so you know what direction to head.  Hunting down hidden collectables will require a skillful mix of precision swings, slingshotting and parkour.  The physics of swinging is also much more responsive - the ""advanced"" controls of the original game are now baseline, so you can lock or extend your cable length at the push of a button.  Extra momentum can be added to a swing by moving your arms just the right way at the right moment in a swing, something you'll learn intuitively by traversing the more windy highways.

The voice acting isn't flawless but isn't bad enough to be painful.  The scenery is colourful, varied and generally at least a little awe inspiring.  Honestly, all up, this goes on my list as one of the defining VR experiences.  Congratulations to the developers on making a good concept so much better.","Nov 22, 2018 at 12:56 PM",5, 1,

It just became a chore dieing yet again. 50+ deaths on just one sequence is torture, especially when a few jumps a way is what feels like another 50+ one (I gave up after 10).   I was seconds away from an uninstall but have decided to wait til the new year and hope for an update.  Earlier levels are awesome, and I dont mind a bit of difficulty but balance/difficulty on the laval level looks un-play tested or was play tested by an aim bot.

The developers should add at least one more level to make it look like a full game, hopefully, a differnt looking level. Also, they could use current levels longer in the game story, by i.e. make the player look for other stuff or killing more boses (which is amazing).

2022-05-28 14:55:55.495114,Fredrix,Mediocre but has its moments,"The swinging mechanic is pretty good and really makes you feel like Spiderman. But only when you are in the ""flow"". I found it pretty annoying when they sometimes removed the green parts just to make the game harder. And sure, it is harder to jump from platform to platform or swing only from one green part to another with no other optional paths while you often need the ""perfect swing"" to be able to reach. But I found that incredible boring and frustrating. Besides, the story was not exactly interesting, so when I got frustrated at the last level I sometimes wondered if it was worth continuing... But I liked the voices. 

I just think that they should have come up with another idea of ""making the game harder towards the end"" instead of removing the ""freedom"" and therefore the ""flow"". But what do I know? Some people may be incredible at this and therefore don't get stuck and frustrated at the harder parts towards the end. Sure looks like that by the rating.

Windlands 2 however is the real deal. The locomotion is rich and deep with a high skill ceiling (like rocket jumping in a classic FPS) and genuinely fun; the combat of hitting mid-air shots with the bow in between swings is *super* satisfying and one of the single best combat mechanics I've played in VR yet (which really rests on the first point--again high skill ceiling and rewarding to master); the world is larger, more alive, and even more beautiful than the first one; and to top it off playing this in co-op with friends is by far one of the best co-op experiences I've ever had (VR or no)--seeing them hit crazy shots or see when you hit crazy shots, laughing when they miss a swing and fall to their death, just incredibly enjoyable. It even has excellent and extensive options menus for all manner of control preferences.

2022-05-28 14:55:55.540991,decimatedpie,"Best VR Dungeon Crawler, but Swinging!","Honestly I have been waiting for a VR adventure game like this. It is a weird but awesome mix of a zelda like world and the swinging mechanics of a PS spider-man game. The boss fights are pretty challenging. A boss requires a skilling mix of bow shooting,  moving on the ground, and swinging to get away. The multiplayer is great, which handled surprisingly well for just coming out today. It gives real fear of falling when you miss a shot and fall into lava. It is in my top VR games just based on original gameplay and a very artistic world. It is further awesome based on the world size, which is huge!

My only issue I had was the destination marker would dissapear. I think it happened because I was on a gathering mission, but I still got a little confused on what I had to do. I recommend maybe adding a 'journal' or something to indicate what the current mission is. I think it is sometimes on the right hand, but it would be nice if it was in the menu as well or something. Overall a great game though, highly recommend.","Sep 13, 2018 at 1:26 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 14:55:58.655660,Khaazzam,Please fix this game,"Behind the flashy swinging and cool mechanics of shooting arrows at enemies in mid air, this game completely failed to improve upon the flaws that plagued the first game. For starters, why can't I stop on a dime? WHY IS THERE NO DEDICATED BUTTON THAT ALLOWS TO STICK A LANDING? It is completely impossible to control your momentum when landing. Secondly, Why did the devs remove the ability to hook anything? The most fun ive had in vr is swinging in windlands on easy mode, which gives you complete freedom to fly wherever you want, independent of bushes needing to be there. That freedom was the best experience. it makes you feel like spiderman. seriously. Why am I forced to only hook trees? The puzzle element to the game gets so annoying after a while, I just want to be able to hook what ever I want. Lastly, I am stuck in the desert map because I think I entered the portal too early. There is no objective that tells me where to go. I started exploring and now I cant find the portal, or a menu option that takes me back to the hubworld. This button existed in the original windlands but you guys stripped that away too. So after putting 4 hours into the game, I have to start it over because you guys didn't put a fail safe mechanism in case the player gets lost. Last of all, the bow is flawed completely. When I try to use it quickly to open the doors, half of the time it does not work properly. After restarting the game, and making it to the last door, you guys mount the player with the impossible task of hitting 20 panels in 15 seconds to open the last door. The bow is unreliable. 360 degree triple sensor set up. Its not my equiptment. You  cannot shoot quick enought with it because it confuses the controls 50% of the time. It also just straight up glitches. *tries to take a quick shot with the bow and literally nothing happens. I CANNOT PLAY THE FINAL LEVEL. The flawed bow mechanics make it too hard. Take a hint from sairento VR and let us pull the bow off our back","Nov 1, 2018 at 12:46 AM",2, 0,"Hi Khaazzam,

We're really sorry to hear that some parts of the game didn't meet your expectations.

You can enable hook anything in the advance options menu before starting a new game, we will look into making this more obvious.

The feedback you have provided is extremely valuable to us and will assist in helping us balance the game in terms of difficulty. We are always listening to feedback and look to improve with every patch.

Many thanks,

The boss fights are incredibly satisfying when you fly around and shoot arrows at them at the same time. WINDLANDS 2 DELIVERED and is now one of my vr best of the best experiences.

2022-05-28 14:55:58.688572,lil_sandwich,This Isn't Windlands,"I feel like this sequal lacks any of the character the first Windlands has. Yes, the grappling hook gameplay is improved, and some areas look pretty, but that's about it for me. For starters, the insentive to explore feels artificial. The worlds in Windlands 2 are much bigger than its predecessor, but they lack any real landmarks. Instead, Windlands 2 has these markers that indicate excactly where you should go. This completely breaks the immersion for me because I feel like I'm just being being told where to go instead of having any real motivation to explore. The landmarks in Windlands 1, however, stand out amongst everything else due to their interesting, detail-rich structures; they have a very iconic feel to them. Because of that, the landmarks inspire true curiosity in the player, unlike the markers used in Windlands 2. The markers also make Windlands 2 very linear. On the exterior, Windlands 2 is an open world game, but it really isn't. You could explore all the boss areanas out of sequential order, but nothing will happen if you don't defeat the other bosses first. Windlands 1, on the other hand, starts each world off with a forking path, allowing for the player choose which location to explore first based on what they find the most intriguing. Also, the addition of combat to Windlands 2 in general takes away the exploration aspect for me. It feels more like I'm playing a robot killing game with hints of exploration than I am playing an exploration game. This sounds nitpicky, but exploration is what makes Windlands Windlands. Not only that, but the bosses suck. They are way too hard, and there is no real punishment for dying, making them extremely tedious for them to defeat. So what's the point of having them, or having enemies in the first place? I also think that the addition of npcs takes away the mysterious vibe. Windlands 1 feels more mature without actually being mature due to the lack of cliche plotlines. I just can't take Windlands 2 seriously.","Sep 28, 2018 at 9:47 AM",1, 3,"Hi lil_sandwhich.

If you would like to switch off the markers, this can be done in the options panel > settings. We understand that some players want to enjoy a pure experience and took extra care to build these features in. There are plenty of hidden secrets and landmarks that stay true to the original Windlands formula which are still yet to be found and we can’t wait to see who gets to them first.

2022-05-28 14:55:58.704529,LuluViBritannia,"Excellent, perfect sequel!","Windlands 2 is a perfect step forward from the first game. It takes everything good from the first game and even improves it, and also adds multiplayer and battles (which makes the game much more than just a platform game).
Once again, we get to soar through the sky under low gravity, which is an incredible feeling! But now we also have a bow to fight machines. We get to fight while soaring, Attack on Titan style. That alone makes this game incredible and unique!
On top of that, the mechanics have been reviewed: the devs have added the ""slide"" motion (whenever we get to a floor at high speed, the character slides on it which makes it speed up instead of slowing down) and the ability to pull ourselves forward with the ropes. Those make the game even more fluid than before!

As for the story, I don't really care for it, I barely even listen to the characters so I can't say anything about it. That said, it feels more complete than the first game, with some stakes and an actual storyline. But really the story is just an excuse.

Now, I have to point out a few flaws, which you may consider major, or not.
- First, the game is clearly designed for multiplayer. As such, some objectives are extremely hard to take on on single player. This is frustrating, because usually, the difficulty should be adapted to the number of players. Here it's not the case.
- Then, the graphics are clearly a huge step down compared to the first. The colors are less beautiful and makes no sense: orange juice can OHKO... that's right, orange juice ; the sky is colored with a horrible cyan or orange color ; ...
- The level design of the boss battles is not only repetitive, it's also badly done.
- I don't find the voices really... professional. Though that's an usual problem in indie games.

In the end, the game is not perfect, of course. But for each tiny flaw, it makes up for with yet again a wonderful soundtrack, an exceptional gameplay, and a huge amount of fun with multiplayer and battles!","Sep 17, 2018 at 5:28 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:55:58.720487,Squadaloo,A Tale of Two Games,"I had the original for PSVR but found it mediocre due to the dualshock controls.  I decided to pick up the sequel anyways due to the new features and Oculus Touch, and found it slightly better but for reasons I didn't expect.

For those worried about missing out on the original, the story in 2 is completely new and you can hop into this game without prior knowledge.  The story is fairly generic:  it's not bad, it just exists to move the game along.  The voice acting is done mostly well although all but one of the characters is forgettable or cliche.

The swinging mechanic is by far the game's strongest tool.  It can take time to get used to the way momentum works but once you do you'll find yourself zipping along at top speed and it's exhilerating.  The level design is also mostly good for rewarding momentum although it does slip here and there by forcing slower platforming at points.  Also, the second area in the game doesn't play well with the game's waypoint system so it can be very easy to get lost.

The combat, on the other hand, is weak.  Facing off against smaller foes works fine, but the boss battles are just horribly designed.  The difficulty is all over the place with the first boss being harder than most of the bosses in the game.  The approach the devs took to designing these fights seems to have been make them as difficult as possible, but give you infinite lives and don't reset the boss between deaths.  This has the strange effect of making bosses incredibly frustrating to beat but also makes their death inevitable.  I found the easiest way to take out some bosses was to not even try to stay alive and to instead to just throw myself high in the air and fire arrows at them wildly as I fell to my death.  Beating them feels more like a sigh of relief than an accomplishment since you can't lose.

Overall, I'd actually give the game 3.5 stars since it's pretty good: I opted for 3 stars though since 4 seems like too strong of a recommendation.","Sep 15, 2018 at 11:22 AM",3, 16,

Just follow the mark right in front of you :-( Another challenge in Windlands 1 is to find hidden artefacts which make little noise when you are closed to them. Here, artefacts are nearly disappeared with no noise :-(
Music is very good in Windlands 1 and appears when it's the right time. In Windlands 2 , music is always on and repetitive :-( 
There's a real atmosphere in Windlands 1, a kind of magic. Not in Windlands 2.

You would try to figure out how high you could scale.  It had a bit of a story too.  It was a nice place to visit to get away from real life for a bit.

Windlands 2 ditches that and in the first 15 minutes has you go up against a boss that took me over an hour to beat.  It also features a new shooting mechanic.

Allow us to hook onto other players as an option that the host can enable, would be very fun & allow for slingshot scenarios. Allow the host to teleport to other players, this causes difficulty. Make it an option for the host to make the host teleport button teleport directly to the host instead of their last checkpoint.

On a positive note, it gave me one of the coolest, most immersive moments I've had in VR, when the giant sandworm jumped over our ship in the intro sequence. Never felt such scale before! 3 stars for sandworm.","Oct 6, 2018 at 2:33 PM",3, 1,

A dream come true!,"It's a tough job being VR game designer, many aspects have to be considered - from getting perfect controls, making breathtaking graphics, pushing adrenaline-inducing gameplay and not to forget getting those magic 90 fps also on the previous generation af video cards. Can it really be done? Windlands 2 just did! Admitted, I haven't finished the game yet, but I don't remember seeing a more polished VR game: I know the devs are proud to call themselves ""indie"", but this game beats all the AAA games I can think of - and it does it in spades. 
If Windlands was awesome, then Windlands 2 is easily beyond description, although one word springs to mind: Reference. My top 3 of best ever VR games has just been changed to Lone Echo, Moss and Windlands 2.
I gave the game the worst conditions I could think of and started the game forcing super-sampling (ss) 2.0 - and I got perfect 90 fps. Ok, in the start, later I had to reduce antialiasing to 2x and kept view distance to 1.2 (couldn't see any difference between 1.2 and 5 anyway), and got solid 90 fps using an oc'ed GTX 1080, i7 7700K and 16GB 3200MHz. Controls are better than Windlands, love the bow, and the world is now filled with animated life. Textures get extra detail when you're close, just awesome.

Hi TAH78.

I’m really sorry to hear this. If the boss battles are too challenging, we recommend switching to the easy difficulty first which gives you some extra hits from enemies before respawning. You can also head into the advanced options when starting a new game to reduce the weak points on bosses.

I'm mostly going to talk about the tree cave after the first boss, finding 8 parts.  I've completed the 2nd boss.  This tree cave is so big, I spent about 1-2 hours in it just playing around, and with so many nooks, crannies, and hard to reach places that it felt really strange that they were almost all empty.  I was thinking a Mario game would never let you find a cool hard to get to area and not be rewarded.   Strangely, if you look wayyyy up, you can see a glowing waypoint.  I have no idea if it's possible to reach it (I concluded it was not despite getting within 2 or 3 ""layers""), and if I did reach it, it probably was totally empty.   So, I gave up; not knowing.  I figure I can turn on the hook anywhere option, but that's cheating.      Oh, and the bosses are really difficult, which is jarring in comparison to the 99% of the time things are peaceful.

2022-05-28 14:56:14.465376,jac,"Good, but short. A great Sequel.","Windlands 2 is a great follow up to windlands 2, improving on the gameplay in several ways. Aside from its short length, a few gameplay issues hold it back. That said, its a must play for any vr enthusiast.

From windlands 1, there have been several tweaks. For instance, movement in your room effects your charcter position, and if your upper body makes iton to a ledge, you will land on the ledge. There is also this new mechanic where if you land from high up, you dip down a bit more, almost like a roll, and jumping out of this gives your jump a boost. Wall jumping has been reworked a bit so you can't get the crazy ultra jumps from the first game, but theyve also been nerfed pretty hard. Wall jumping is almost useless in this game.

Expanding on that, the platforming is way, way easier. The difficulty curve felt a lot more natural than windlands 1, but its a shame it wasn't long enough to get to where windlands 1 did. It would have been nice to see some more difficult sections in the game.

And that brings me to combat. Dudes, work on that bow. Several times, I would try to pull up the bow, only for just the strings to appear, and not allow me to shoot anything. This did kill me several times. Next, difficulty only effects combat in a platforming game, you should be explicite about that. You die to easily and there is no punishment for dying. The ground of many of the combat arenas instant kill you. Turning around, shooting a homing missile, and turning back around to grab a bush thats wizzing past your head is extremely hard. It should be more forgiving, either by having bigger bushes or a safer floor. Since there is no punishment for dying, and living is so hard, it encourages users to just run in, chip some health, and let yourself die. Which is not fun, its frustrating.

All that said, windlands 1 & 2 are amazingly fun. Soaring around is a blast and the moments when you lunge in the air, shoot an enemy with your bow, then swing away are fantastic.","Sep 18, 2018 at 1:33 PM",5, 2,

In W2 you really don't have to do that because there are an (over) abundance of places you can grapple to.   When you are following the story It almost feels like you are on a tour of the world.

It's nice to see NPCs and have some ""quests"" to go on.  There are still artifacts to collect, although I really miss the cracking/creeking sound they made in W1.
