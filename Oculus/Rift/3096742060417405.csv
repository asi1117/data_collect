In the end it's basically a 360 camera dubbing as a 'VR"" experience but just being there and then seeing the recreations from its glory days was enough to bump it up to 4 stars, even if it could use a serious gfx upgrade. It's worth it if you're into history, Roman hisotry, or greco/roman arctitecture.",Nov 14 at 1:57 PM,4, 1,
