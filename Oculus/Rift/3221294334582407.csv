For know I would suggest working on bug fixes, new content, and especially physics, as you can find bugs in the game and there isn't much to interact with. You don't feel like you are holding your sword  and you can see your hand phase through it.",Apr 2 at 11:06 AM,5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:28:37.006836,A4AM,Alot of potential,"I brought this game on a sale and im enjoying a large portion of the game as of around 2 hours of gameplay. I cant wait for new updates to roll in and combat to get more and more immersive. One massive issue i have is with the current animations in combat, they're way too easy to predict and also i can counter by just spinning my hand with a sword. There is a WIP level that i cant wait to play but if you're looking for a perfect game this isnt for you, wait a good few months and im sure the devs will update and develop with time, as of 21/12/2020 im seeing ALOT of area to improve and ALOT of potential to become an amazing game. 

The only improvements i can thonk of is:
- NPC enemy animations
- Different Weapons
- Melee Focused training (Though there is waves for range, i find melee and up-close combat is alot more enjoyable)
- More missions (Im aware the devs are working on new and interesting missions, but the only playable mission just feels very easy, and a bit too lackluster)

Overall a fun and somewhat calm game to play as a timer filler, but as updates roll this game will become more and more fun, and for the price, defo worth a download.","Dec 22, 2020 at 5:21 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 20:28:37.022793,skyte,a few things,"this is a good game, honestly you feel really cool when you are using the katana and the bow. i would give this game 5 stars but they do not have a story or any other interesting gameplay. they should have released it later.","Nov 22, 2020 at 2:43 AM",3, 3,"Hi Skyte, thanks for honest feedback! We decided to go with EA and focus on releasing few features at a time intentionally. As we receive feedback and polish each part of future game at early stage. More content and features will be added at regular basis. We promise to deliver one of the best VR experiences on market, stay tuned!"
