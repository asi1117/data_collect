2022-05-28 12:34:09.446994,Janoque,Why still no update for this version?,Why did you abandon this version? You should add all the updates from the quest version to this version of the game!! Pretty sue how the quest is better and features and this one is only better in graphics. THERE IS ALSO NO PAUSE BUTTON? You should add the pause button!!!,Jul 21 at 9:44 AM,1, 26,

In terms of gameplay this game is fast and with a lot of action making the player feel that it's in a movie! 
If you have a lot of space (no pun intended), specially if you are using the Quest version (thank you cross-buy), maximizing your play area gives you a really amazing experience where you can ""run"" (be safe!) and feely move away from the lasers. 
I really recommend this game. It's amazing!","Jan 22, 2021 at 6:32 PM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 12:34:12.636595,RehabReality,So Much Fun,"This game is so easy to get the hang of and so fun! It is exactly what I bought it for - a casual, arcade-style shoot em'-up game. It is really fun and requires lots of energy and skill. The four game modes don't have much of a difference, the levels are the same with different elements overall. Arcade - 3 lives, slow motion when you get shot at, different shield types and different gun types. Hardcore - 3 lives, no slow motion when getting shot at, different shield types and different gun types. Training mode - 50% points, health regen, slow motion when getting shot at, different shield types and different gun types. Old school - Slow motion when getting shot at, no different shield types and no different gun types. The sound track is really good and fitting for the game. An essential for any platform!","Jun 8, 2020 at 9:26 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 12:34:12.651555,qybat,Pretty fun.,"This game is exactly what it looks like: A simple, story-less shoot-and-dodge game. It knows what it is, and it is very good at being that: It's truly a perfectly done example of what VR can do. The game runs smoothly, the controls feel natural, the difficulty curve is refined to be exactly right, the enemies are distinct and varied. Even dodging the incoming projectiles works perfectly, as you dodge and weave around the flying lasers and rockets.

Hours of practice and I am getting close to defeating the big boss droid. It's like a bullet hell game in three dimensions.","May 5, 2020 at 5:39 PM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 12:34:12.666515,smokeykiller51,A great game to get new players into VR,I initially had some issues. Though it wasnt due to this game... However this game did show my mistake better than others. I quickly contacted their customer support team. Initially I was getting lags whenever Id fire both weapons.... well they responded even went through the trouble to find the board I told them I was using. I had put my headset into a usb 3 gen 2 slot... which aparently my headset didnt like but mostly tollerated. Moved it to usb gen 1 and no problems. It instantly corrected the issue and my other games now run smoother  aswell. As far as gameplay. I have only been abe to play a bit but it performs well and is quitw fun. Different firing modes and either hand can switch to a shield. Which for me helps alot. Due to customer service and the fact the game is fun 5 stars. Buy this game!!!,"Apr 25, 2020 at 1:32 AM",5, 6,

This might be the best VR game you can get, especially if you're trying to get in shape and/or exercise.

Not only that, it's an extremely cool and intuitive game.

I have no idea how it always seems fresh and new but wow, that part of this game is SUCH a draw. It is a hell of a workout also, with the amount of twists and squats you need to do. The things people forget to use are actually some of the most useful. The tractor beam/cutter and shield are must uses. Different attackers need to have different approaches to beat them. The weapons are the bomb (literally) and the level of skill needed to finish is unknown to me. After playing, sweating and rocking for hours...I still am so low on the scoreboards. A must have. Very easy controls for people who are demo'ing for people that want ""action"" as well.","Sep 30, 2019 at 1:29 AM",5, 9,

Why is there no ability to use my own music in game?
I've heard enough about Barrachos Steeped in History just from the soundtrack alone, and I don't care after the hundredth time of hearing it.
Sideloading your own playlist in another background app and then turning the music down in game just doesn't cut it as your own song doesn't slow down during intense fights.  The algorithm used to slow the original soundtrack down when this happened could be implemented on any user defined audio file.  
Think about it -  sales would skyrocket if you made it so people could blast baddies away to their own music.","May 18, 2019 at 8:54 AM",5, 49,

""Galaga in VR"" is usually all I need to say; the classic mechanics are instantly understood (even if they don't appreciate switching weapons or deeper strategy) -- they ""get it"" right away and are no longer intimidated.

2022-05-28 12:34:40.916067,Sombra84,Review For Long Term VR Players...,"Many people seem amazed by this game and it's easy to understand, this was their first real VR game.  This particular game does a good job at providing a very smooth, easy to play experience.  The mechanics are well implemented, polished and it runs great even on lower end hardware.

That being said, long term VR players will complain about the lack of true content.  As a long term VR player with very particular taste and a fellow developer I think this is a well worthy title if you grab it on sale.  It is great for 30 minute arcade VR runs and easily captures interest in short bursts.  Enemies are fun to interact with (aka kill), animations well done, menu system well done and weapons feel beautiful.  The haptic feedback is probably one of the most balanced VR renditions I have felt with oculus touch controllers.

I snagged this on sale for $7.99 and feel that was a great deal, I'd be shy to pay anymore due to the essential ""wave shooter"" dynamic with no movement and little variation.","Oct 24, 2018 at 4:20 PM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 12:34:44.094670,HisRoyalMajestyM,Seriously overrated.,"I think others have mentioned it already, its a 180° wave shooter, that if played as first VR game seems very impressive, just to be deflated like a baloon from all of its initial excitement once you try other VR games. On top of that you then find out the game really lacks variety. There is only 2 different arenas (last time I played) and it feels like 80's arcade games, but in VR. The whole game mechanic boils down to ""beat your score"" which isn't terrible if you like arcade games, but it will get boring fast.

2022-05-28 12:34:44.109630,JackDiddley,A Simple Solid Shooter,"Sometimes the simplest game can be a lot of fun to play.  This game has no story, no puzzles, and you don't move around other than to dodge bullets in slo-mo.  You have two guns (with various settings), a shield, and a lasso thing.  Several different types of little flying robots start coming to shoot at you and you have to shoot them first.  There are different types of ""buffs"" but I'm not really clear on how to earn them.
If you took an 80s style arcade game and made it VR it would be this.  You play on as more and more tougher flying robots come at you until eventually you lose all three of your lives, go back to the menu screen and see where your high score lands on the leaderboard.
The fun factor is high and so is the replay value.  I really like the 80s style graphics in the menu screen.  Don't think too much, just strap in and blast away.","Jul 4, 2018 at 1:36 PM",4, 8,

1.) You like the challenge of classic 70s-80s arcade games a lot; or
2.) It is on sale for less than $5; or
3.) You like the idea of dodging bullets standing in one place while shooting spheres with no more sense of progression than larger and larger waves.","Sep 6, 2018 at 1:50 AM",3, 7,

This is a simple arcade wave shooter at heart, but it's executed to perfection like nothing you've ever seen before! VR brings this to life. It's an adrenaline rush. Different gun modes, power ups, reach behind your shoulder to swap that hand between a gun and a personal shield.

The high score mechanic has been played out since the 1980's, but I actually care about it here! I keep coming back to see if I can top my previous best. This also doesn't require a monstrous PC to run smoothly. This ran just as smoothly on my old, slow below-VR-minimum-spec R9 280 (not even the 280X) as it does on the GTX 1060 I upgraded to.

Don't let that scare you off. This game starts out easy, but does get harder as you progress. Learn all of the different offensive options you have and if you choose to use a shield, you can use a shield.

Quite a workout if you put it on hardcore so the bullets don't slow down, gun in right hand, sword in left, doing matrix moves while slashing around with your sword.

The special effects and sound are very lavish and impressive. You can see a lot of love has gone into this. You have two pistols with different fire modes. You can also swap a pistol for a shield by holding the controller over your back and hitting the grip button. The shield also has a tractor beam as a second fire mode. Using these different weapons and tactics you fight wave after wave of little flying smart droids. It may be simple but it is an incredibly enjoyable and addictive game, which also gets you burning calories! 
'Bullet time' slow motion is triggered when enemies fire at you giving you time to shoot or dodge the fire, and also making you feel like you are IN The Matrix.
