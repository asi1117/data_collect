2022-05-28 13:58:39.544987,Soulcold1982,Most fun VR game I've played so far,"I understand it is crossplatform, and it looks like the different ship designs where made with each platform in mind.  My favortie ship is the Vulcan, where I can aim with my visor, steer and control my ship with my controllers.  Feels like i'm Boba Fet piloting Slave 1.  Keeping my rectical on my target with my eyes, while my ship is moving around is a mental workout that I enjoy.  Only bad thing is playing multiplayer.

2022-05-28 13:58:42.742053,Resylt,Missed in balance & casual play,"Extremely repetitive gameplay. There's no option to choose what game mode to play, when going into matchmaking, so you're stuck with whatever the hell the server feels like forcing on you...and as someone who cannot stand objective-based pvp, all but one of the game modes even remotely interest me. Gave the others a fair try for a few hours, and all it succeeded in doing was causing me to nearly put my controllers through the window. Pretty sure my neighbor thinks I just murdered someone with the cursing that followed. 

It also frustrates (or frustrated...past-tense I guess...since I will be uninstalling this) the living hell out of me how much damage is required to take someone out. There is no using your primary weapon in dogfights...it's a gatling gun, on a fighter that you can't keep level enough to hit your target before they're out of your crosshairs. So you have to depend solely on your secondary (homing missiles in most cases) to ever land a hit. 

Problem there? In the assault-grade space crafts, the missiles are multi-shot, meaning you can home in and fire up to anywhere from like 5 to 8 at a time from the space crafts that I played in. You can hit your target with literally the entire load, and it won't even take their shields completely down. And by the time you reload? Their shields are back up. 

There also seems to be absolutely no matchmaking based on experience level. 

So you're thrown into the pit with the same people that sit on their butts all day playing this game.

Translation? Unless you're prepared to put in the same game-time, prepare to be killed over, and over, and over. 

Massive reason why I hate PvP games, and why a game like this needs either a casual matchmaking lobby, OR the option to practice against bots of varying difficulty. 

Reason it kept any stars at all was because the flying itself is fun, rapid-paced, very intuitive, and easy to pick up on. It's just the rest of the gameplay that sucks.","Dec 24, 2020 at 9:16 AM",2, 83,

It gives me the option but when I click the button it does absolutely nothing. Also when I was trying to change the controls from and Xbox controller to the Oculus touch controllers, there is no option to ""Save and Exit"" or an ""Okay"" button to save the controls the Oculus touch. There is only a ""Back"" button and it doesn't save any of the settings or controls. This is an insanely annoying flaw that drove me crazy for a solid 30 minutes. I finally decided to uninstall and reinstall the program to fix the issue. Is it really that hard to implement a button that lets you save your controls the way you want them?

There are two things it needs, however. 

1. The ability to release flight assist so you can turn sideways and backwards while keeping forward momentum. Would just be so cool!

2. A single player campaign. I don't need a lame story with voice acting and cut scenes. But I would like a series of challenges that take you from ship to ship and give you a reason to play and earn weapon upgrades, etc.

The subtleties of each ship in different classes kept me entertained and intrigued. Seems like there is no one ship which can dominate, which is great work by the game designers. Love the music build up during and towards the end of battles. Seems like I started playing the game a bit late(end of 2018) as the human players in the online mulitplayer mode are a bit sparse, however it is quick an easy to jump into an online game, without having to wait for ages for other players, which is a major plus.

For a week. That's how long it took me to figure it out (sort of). But then, after a week of shame, they can be proud. This game is magnificent. The feeling, once you figure out flying controls, is mindblowing. I have litterally felt my stomach turn during negative G.

A HOTAS joystick is not a must, but you need one. That's where things get really hairy. My x52 is known to have buggy software, but once I had it up and running, and found a way to disable ""clutch?"" it works.

The forum where all the infomation about the game was, has been closed, so you are on your own. Most Google searches end up leading back to the closed forum. Hello?

Instead you are forced to experiment with button mapping. On my x52 there are 30+ to learn the numbers of by heart, and until you accidentially disable VR in one menu, you are wearing your headset, while guessing buttons in total blindness, during uncountable amounts of button mapping attempts. The menu design makes this a nightmare. Google it.

I hope my message is ""clear"". I love this game as much as i hate it. 3 stars could have been even 6, if only the UI wasn't such a mess.

DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!
It doesn't work anymore... not at all
Unless navigating menus is your thing
Original review (somewhere in 2018)
I spent an entire afternoon chasing fighters in tight circles, I know that's what they mean by ""dogfight"", but it seems so pointless.
As far as I can see there is no objective other than shooting (enemy) fighters or getting shot by them, a fight you cannot win... ever

I'll  give it some more time, who knows maybe I missed something ;) (no pun intended)

Update

I've played it some more, it kinda grows on you but not 1 star more.
Do you know why? The dev(s) had the ingenious idea to add a disable option to the Rifts motion controller setup, and when you scroll over it your control is instantly disabled, yup, no keyboard or mouse or x-box controller can help you now, only task manager can (CTRL-ALT-DEL)

Dev(s) Where did you get your degree(s)? Out of a pack of cornflakes?
You guys are a whole new category of dumb.

Find someone, anyone at all, who's not near braindead, who HAS (at least) one living brain cell who can fix this disaster.
Here's how... remove the option to disable all control.
No one in their right mind would consider irreversibly disabling controller(s) as long as they (may) still need it... stuuuupiiid",Jan 15 at 8:44 PM,3, 22,

Elite Dangerous is pretty boring, frankly, after the initial cool factor. I was worried this game would be a dumbed down version of Elite. It's not. In fact, I'd say combat is much, much more fun and engaging. This is space combat in a team deathmatch environment with GOALS. That means you  don't have to learn a lot of systems or have a million keys to bind. What you do have is some very fun twitch type space combat. You get to constantly do the fun part of space simulation (COMBAT!!!). It may not be strictly realistic, but by god it is beautiful. I have a TM Warthog HOTAS, as well as custom hand built rudder pedals, and they play just fine. In fact, I think this is THE game for my forseeable future. A straight up bargain at $15...

2022-05-28 13:59:04.855294,Krosskeys,Already feeling old.,"A flashy but repetitive and ultimately boring Arena Flight brawler. Clinging balance issues and a lack of variety make for a game where dogfighting has been stripped to it's most bare of elements. A progression system exists but it is the most hollow and rudimentary one I have seen, for a game set in a universe as rich and as vibrant as Eve Online I didn't feel a single spark of what makes that setting so cool.

MASTER multiple types of ships and fighting styles. Or don't, your skill level has little to no impact on your actual combat in game just a case of lining up on a guy and hoping you kill him before the guy who has lined up on you has killed you. 

SIGH with disappointment when you realise you're going into another Carrier Assault map which means 15 minutes of running back and forth between capture points and ships and every now and again maybe shooting a glowy zit on the side of one. 

GET a headache as the abundance of lock on weapons means you will be spending over 3/4 of your game time with the thumping UNF UNF UNF of the lock on alarm as you mash button for whatever counter measures you have or just take the damage,  the real damage is the constricting blood vessels in your head.

ATTEMPT to use the support ships, then give up. 

CLIP into level geometry and bounce around inside it until you explode while the camera snaps all over the place and makes you feel motion sick. 

I mean. You could get it if it was on sale, it might be good for getting a few friends together, the miniscule playerbase on this game means that you will often end up playing against the same people multiple times I suppose you could squad up and try and troll the hell out of one pilot.

EVE continues to deliver high quality (and mindblowing) space-scapes, technologies, and wormhole events. If you came into VR with high expectations of breathtaking immersion, EVE will never let you down. No other rating can be given but 5 for the incredible visuals, and the continued updates and support by the developers. A lot of love went into this game, and the community seems to appreciate it.

2022-05-28 13:59:14.399130,funnywheeno,What a blast!,"I think this game is incredibly polished. Brings back memories of Counterstrike / Team Fortress, but of course, sitting in a spinning cockpit with the world around you exploding is so much better! The levels are wonderfully designed with plenty of obstacles and debris to fly through and around. My only gripe is that the game lacks lots of explanation: What am I supposed to do and how do I do that? How do I read the HUD? How do I learn the features of the different ships other than taking them straight into battle and then finding out that I can't even fire as with my other ship? What do the little number indicators next to the names mean? How can I tell an actually player from a drone? Do drone kills count? I have to do research online to find out about a lot of these things. The carrier missions are intense and lengthy and I've never made it to stage 3. Without doing research online, I wouldn't even have known about the different stages. So, I wish for some more handholding in those areas, but other than that, the game is a total riot on the Rift! I'll be logging lots of hours!

Update: I see now, there is more training in the single-player missions. That is not apparent after the game dumps you into multiplayer mode after the first 5 runs. But it's true that this ame sorely needs a way to reset the view. I don't want to have to be standing in the middle of the room for the entirety of the playtime.","Feb 20, 2018 at 12:38 PM",5, 5,

Several maps with different ogbjectives giving each class its time for glory. A basic looting system. HOTAS X52 works just fine, and no issues whatsoever with an NVidia X52. All that is great except that I find quite mediocre that there is no chat mode or way to build up a team in-game.  Very good gamplay but I find this lack of in-game basic social features makes me claim that this game is unfinished. 20 Euros for an unfinished game is expensive.

All support classes felt pretty much the same, the starting fighter was the only good one, and heavies were basically useless bait.

With the new update, everything is better.  Support ships are more varied (though the Banshee is the only one I enjoy playing) every ship actually feels unique instead of the same ship with a different special ability.  Multiplayer has grown a lot as well.  Where it was usually me and 3 other humans in a cloud of AI, now it is populated again.  The loot boxes are good too.  I don't have to waste as much scrip on appearance.

In fact, you're never really moving really fast unless you hit some type of special ability.  Anybody who is used to VR will not experience any motion sickness and if you do experience it and you're a VR veteran, just sell your VR headset already, you're not cut out for VR.  I found the gameplay to be fun.  And there's several ships with several different abilities.  I played solo, but I can see where a team of friends who know what they're doing can get very far as there is a lot of strategy involved with how the different abilities and spaceships compliment each other.

But after the short tutorial there's only a small rotation of multiplayer maps and modes and a couple of very light single player features. The co-op modes are great fun even if you aren't into multiplayer but you'll still have seen everything within a couple of hours. The game is enjoyable enough to keep playing long past that but £30 still feels very steep.

It is one of the few VR games I am able to play for an hour straight without feeling like I need to puke.  I think it is because the head tracking and controls are fluid enough I know where I am going to next.  If they add the touch controllers I will give this a 5 star rating.

If you are motion sensitive, this game is probably not for you. It made me sick for the first week of playing, but it was so fun that I just took breaks and now I am used to it. The only complaint I have about the game is the lack of instruction for various modes. I had to go to the website, to look up what the objectives were for each mode. And I am still a bit confused...still leaving it a 5 star, as you can literally go on their site/forum for any type of help and pretty much have an instant response. Super support.

Unfortunately, the game ultimately comes down to trying to fly in a tighter circle than your opponent. Granted, this is how virtually all multiplayer air/space combat games play out. But other space flight games, like Elite Dangerous, give the player a lot more to do besides fly in circles with an opponent. With Eve Valkyrie that's all you do. All the pretty graphics are absolutely wasted when you're only trying to focus on one ship that is flying in circles. You don't really have time to notice that cool looking capital ship in the background when you're busy trying to keep on your opponent like a merri-go-round. If you like flying in circles, great. This game is for you. If you prefer more free-flight time and linear movement that allows one to appreciate weaving through an asteriod field and taking in the beauty of a planet or sun, pick up Elite Dangerous.","Feb 21, 2017 at 12:54 AM",1, 11,

It's hard to know whether you are playing bots or real people most of the time, and not a fan of how you have to play a certain number of matches to unlock more modes than just team deathmatch (with mostly bots). I always enjoyed Elite Dangerous Arena (CQC) much more than this, but the devs of that one never fixed the broken matchmaking system so CQC mode died. That was the best, had much deeper gameplay mechanics than this and felt to be at a proper pace for VR, was also less nausea inducing since it was slower.

The game is kind of fun at first, but once the initial wow factor of looking down at your body or out of the windows wears off, you are left with an overrated empty shell of a game.","Nov 14, 2016 at 8:07 AM",2, 12,

The asking price is a little high, but if you've ever considered yourself a fan of space sims, specifically combat sims, dogfighting (not you, Michael Vick. Red Barons and Iceman/Goose) then you need this game. The action is excellent. The ability to track targets with your head, and even use it to control some weapons depending on the ship... it's the kind of thing gamers will be talking about for years to come, similar to the first time playing Mario 64. Wing Commander, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, you name it. We've all had the starfighter fantasies and this game delivers on an awful lot of that. If you want extended ship ownership simulations, go get Elite. That game's awesome, and has some excellent, deep combat if you're willing to put in the time. If you want quick arcadey multiplayer, get this. Note that the single player is a little lacking, but it's mostly to get your feet so you can go online and not have your face eaten immediately by salty old sim vets like me. 5/5 and I don't give that to multiplayer only games lightly.","Nov 15, 2016 at 6:39 PM",5, 8,

There isn't much for single-player at all and the multiplayer doesn't have much of a userbase even with it being cross-platform, but that could change. However, the people playing it right now are extremely friendly and helpful. EVE Valkyrie is a nice looking game and the controls are tight and handle great, however there are a bunch of issues that prevent me from playing and coming back to it. The first is the terrible UI and menu system. Nothing is explained and for the first little bit I was beyond confused, not knowing what any of the modes mean or what the menu options did. During the few missions I played, there was narration on what to do.. however I was in the middle of dogfighting and couldn't pay much attention to the directions. It would be nice if there was some text on screen to supplement the voice. I couldn't even pause my game in the middle of single-player, let alone change my settings.

The multiplayer aspect of the game is kind of fun.. for about half hour or so until you realize it's all the same dogfighting until someone wins. There isn't much else for multiplayer content besides some fleet customization (colors), and daily challenges. I can see it being more fun if you have a squad of friends.. but it will still get repetitive fast.

2022-05-28 14:00:58.909962,superkev73,Revolutionary gaming experience,"I've been playing this game addictively since April and I'm still going strong. Multiplayer combat is where Valkyrie really shines, and it's backed by the most supportive community of gamers I've ever experienced. CCP keeps tweaking and adding to the game, keeping it fresh and confirming that Valkyrie is great value for money. Many of the changes come from community suggestions too, showing that the devs really care about creating a game that we want to play. This game is a must-have if you own a Rift. See you in space!","Nov 21, 2016 at 12:21 PM",5, 4,
