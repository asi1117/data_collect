2022-05-28 20:03:25.349022,idk31,Beautiful,"NOTE: Updating my review as my issue was resolved. Before, I could not enjoy it due to FOV/image stretching issues.

This is a beautiful and peaceful experience. First of all, the music is great! I feel instantly relaxed. It's precomputed 3D fractal geometry you can fly around in. Not video for those wondering. While you can't zoom in on anything, you can morph the shape for a bit different view. It's not infinite. Eventually you'll reach the end after tens of minutes for some fractals. Sooner for others. But then you can just turn around. You're in control.

There's a perfect balance of themes here. Four in total. The first is free. The others are a buck each. I would describe them as bubbly, blocky, techy, and organic landscapes with their own music and mood. A great way to destress and possibly even get some inspiration.",Mar 8 at 7:03 AM,5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:03:25.362985,another.realm,no zooming in :(,"90%+ of why fractals are cool, is because you can zoom in/out freely and see the recursive repeating patterns.  I have this many-year-old iPad app named frax that does exactly that (2D only of course).

So I was excited to find this app that lets me free-fly in 3D space and zoom in/out to explore the fractal world.  Except that I can't figure out how to zoom in -- the ""morphing"" is making some change (not sure what) but it is not zooming into the world.  I want to be like Ant-Man!  Eventually I read other review comment that says there is no zooming.  (It is ""pre-computed"" world or whatever reason ...)  SO DISAPPOINTED.  Okay it is still cool to move around in a 3D fractal-like landscape -- for a few minutes.  But as I said, 90%+ of what makes fractals cool is not available.",Mar 30 at 4:12 PM,3, 5,
2022-05-28 20:03:25.379940,Bob-Rolha,Fly smooth in the fractal world.,"It works well, there is no problem that it is precomputed fractal, since in any case you will be immersed in the convincing environment and with a smooth movement. Processing fractal in real time is an arduous task, so this is a good alternative. I would like to know if when I buy it, I will still have the button with the option to fly through the scenario without needing the controls, as it is in the preview. I like this option. A defect that would be good to be corrected is that during the flight, the rendering for small details, has a very intense aliasing effect that interferes a lot, it would be as if the image were with the appearance of those images that suffered a high level of compression and therefore have low quality. Therefore, a solution, an anti-aliasing technique, would be needed to improve quality, in order to solve the problem of noise and artifacts that appear between small details and between the edges of 3D objects. Anyway, I congratulate the developer for the excellent work.
Greetings from Brazil.",Mar 11 at 9:20 AM,4, 9,
2022-05-28 20:03:25.393903,Mountain-Man-VR,One of my favorite VR experiences,"I've seen YouTube videos of these expansive fractal geometry worlds on the flat screen.  Being able to fly through them in VR with vastness and scale was a top VR experiene for me.  I did not have any of the issues others are having although it could be a little clearer at times.  I bought the other 3 downloads and love them all.  Others were complaining that it's not true fractals, It's a static fly through experience of what sure looks like fractal gemetry and is a super cool experience.",Mar 6 at 9:01 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:03:25.409860,DoggoInBox,its cool i guess,"theres only 1 free map that you can explore, the rest you have to pay for. very cool, but it gets boring after 10 minutes.",Mar 17 at 12:08 PM,3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:03:28.506716,Malikart,Great,"Great, looks very nice! But i think it would be even nicer if it had the same controls as in the game ""Aircar""...just my thoughts",Mar 24 at 1:49 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:03:28.521676,estefez,Fantastic,"I'm a big fan of watching 3D fractal renders online, and thought there's no way that level of fidelity could be run in realtime for VR. Man was I wrong! Then I was doubly surprised to discover you can manipulate the fractals as you fly through them: each seams to be a blend of a couple equations, so by adjusting their influence you get even more configurations than the defaults. Consider my mind blown!",Apr 30 at 12:14 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:03:28.536636,Cthulu-Hoops,Fantastic pre computed 3D fractals.,"Just great. Nice seeds chosen, Good colour selections, pre-computed to a good level for modern 3D hardware to run at full framerate and a lovely soundtrack for the tours. The first pre-computed scene is free and then a buck a piece for others, which is more than fair. Whilst I understand that parametric fractals would have been cool, I'm glad that they went with pre-computed geometry as the framerate is maintained at 90hz for me. I was a big fan of boxplorer on the original Rift DK1/DK2 so thanks for this.",Apr 28 at 3:49 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:03:28.551596,RuneSR2,Nice tech demo for a few minutes,"Did not work with my Rift CV1, but started in 2D mode. Seems the app does not support native Oculus drivers, I have the Valve Index connected and that hmd controls OpenXR. Reviving the app with Index worked perfectly. The app is fun for a few minutes, but ultimately has little content. I have already uninstalled it.",Apr 16 at 8:41 PM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:03:28.566556,krisvdvijver,mind blowing,"When I first saw a 360 fractal movie in VR (5 years ago), I was impressed and I immediately wished it could be real-time instead of a video. Fractal Fly will give you this and show you the beauty of mathematics. One world is free, and the others need to be purchased, but are very cheap. I spent about an hour flying around and I loved it. With a little imagination, you can visit the most amazing worlds.",Mar 19 at 6:29 PM,5, 1,
