Most of the negative reviews mention motion sickness or bad picture. Hah! Not in a million years. Those folks need to adjust their VR settings (or are new to Vr). If they think this is bad, they'd better not try a game with real motion and fast movement like an action game!!  No, this is superior photo quality and fully 3D with audio dialogue. It IS an historical walkthrough, but I've seen good VR and bad, and this is not only flawless in appearance but quite interesting if you're interested in the inside of places lived during WWII. It's one of the games I've replayed about 3 times now and for a walkthrough with no action and no real-time, that's saying a lot. It's just you and the narrator, like a tour. But, unless you're just immature or really don't get how to set up your VR so you can see right, this is a top rate one. Short, sweet, and worth every minute!","Dec 19, 2019 at 3:59 AM",5, 23,

The product itself was top notch, and the kind of worthy title you should show to your kids, it's the sort of experience that justifies VR as a technology. The lack of 6DOF made it pretty uncomfortable however. I haven't tried the update on my Rift S yet but it did hit the Quest a couple weeks ago and I was thoroughly impressed with it on there.

You just walk around her house. The camera is really weird and made me dizzy. Not a single nazi in sight either. Very dissapointing.,"Jul 1, 2018 at 2:43 AM",1, 18,
2022-05-28 17:31:14.992872,JeremySr007,This is how history should be taught,"1st off, there is a huge bug in this experience. Its not so much a bug, but more of how they built it. You are basically viewing 360 degree pre-rendered photos. That means when you move in real life, the game or app doesnt register this movement. So if you stand up and walk closer to a wall inside Anne's room, you will still be in the same exact spot as you were. 

This is bad because your brain registered that your body should be moving in a 3D space, but it didnt. This causes VR sickness. What the developers should have done was create an entirely explorable house with either teleport or joystick walking. Reference the free VR game Rec Room to see how to do walking, teleporting and flying correctly in VR without causing any VR sickness. 

As it stands, this app is very informative and I sat through the entire 22 minute experience in story mode, and it was very moving, interesting as well as educational. I wish we had VR in schools when I was younger, as something like this would have shut up the kids who didnt want to learn and make them experience history as close as possible to really being there. And for the rest of us who were in school to learn, this would have really enriched our education making us experience what life was like back then instead of just reading about it.

So if the developers are listening, please work with the Oculus team and make this a full walk/teleport/fly experience in the style of Rec Room VR. Also, please create some VR hands for us to use in this app. Having hands in VR that you can use to pick up objects, open doors, touch things and open app menus is another important way to ease VR sickness as the brain starts to believe you are inside there instead of trapped in a bubble where you cant move even though you feel your body moving. You could even make the hands look like authentic gloves from the 1940's to really enrich the experience, and allow us to interact with everything we see in the app.","Jun 27, 2018 at 3:28 AM",4, 5,Good news!

In terms of technical points - the entire environment is pre-rendered (bar a few dust particles). Unfortunately this means that the eye spacing is a little off depending on your headset configuration, leading to some fuzziness. This also means that you cannot move your head around the space, and really immerse yourself. However, due to the high quality of the render, I can understand why it has been done this way to make it look as realistic as possible without the expense on the GPU to render a realistic dynamic environment.

My girlfriend tried this experience and she is shorter than most - due to the (what I assume is) pre-rendered nature, she felt very tall and displaced throughout the experience, as did I for that matter.

Technical points aside, the experience is a great insight into a place and time I'll never get to visit, and the story telling through simple points of interest crossed with in world subtitles is effective.","Jun 13, 2018 at 9:02 PM",4, 4,Good news!

It felt like a museum.   This however, supplements the experience really well in that you feel like you are standing in the rooms as they were at the time and it generates a real atmosphere.

There are problems with the App.   Your position is fixed so when you move your head towards something it moves away from you etc. It would be fantastic if they could create free movement.     Also, the odd item can be clicked on for viewing and a bit of narrative - but these are few and far between and make you want to inspect more.

2022-05-28 17:31:37.134651,FastLawyer,Alforno1 should be banned from Oculus,"This is an amazing, meaninful experience. We get to tour where Ann Frank lived in hiding and wrote her now famous book The Diary of a Young Girl. I did not experience any cross-eyed effect. I think the environment looked good on both the Oculus Rift and the Oculus Go (one of the best on the Go in fact). I recommend doing the story mode versus doing the tour, especially on your first experience. I think the people complaining about Volumetric 3D are being unreasonable as there is no VR with that except for the Google app (Welcome to Light Fields) which is a demo of the technology that is possible. Anyways, Alforno1 and other Nazis like him and everyone who liked his post should be banned from Oculus. We don't need people who deny the holocaust happened or what happened to Ann Frank is fake news. They are so filled with hate that they need to deny history to justify their racism. These are the same brutes that Ann Frank described in her diary. You can't reason with them. Facebook really needs better moderators.","Jun 13, 2018 at 2:07 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:31:40.236355,sebrk,Exceptional experience!,A truly exceptional experience I can highly recommend to anyone. The only caveat is that it seems to be designed for GearVR and Go first so its 3DoF only but storywise its an easy 5-star review.

I've never read ""A Diary of a Young Girl"" but I'm definitely going to purchase it now.
