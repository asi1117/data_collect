2022-05-28 18:04:17.022171,EVILLAMA,Solid Entry in the Rock Band Franchise,"The Positives:
This game is solid. The Rock Band experience has been ported over to the VR and given a new twist. The new gameplay is a lot of fun, and really gives you that feeling of being up on stage. 

The Negatives:
I wish the Classic Mode had been given a little more thought. Having the full audience rocking out behind the highway chart has so much potential! And, the lag. There is a lot of stuttering. I am playing on an Oculus Quest 2 though (Both through Airlink and Direct Connection), and I know this game was never designed with that in mind, so I'll cut it some slack. I can't yet confirm whether it's due to my USB-C cable or not, so I am purchasing a new one with the Quest 2 in mind. If that fixes the issue, then I will update my review to reflect that. Unfortunately though, the game is nearly unplayable for me right now.

It's a shame that this game seems abandoned. With the explosion of VR in the past couple of years, I feel that it was way before its time, which is ironic given that the plastic rock era has long been over. WIth their recent acquisition by Epic Games, maybe Harmonix will revisit this lost gem. As someone who's been rocking out with fake plastic guitars since the original Guitar Hero on PS2, I can only hope so!",Jan 19 at 11:23 AM,4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:04:17.037131,HippieanaJones,Base game is great...,If you can get it to download. I had to remove ICUE corsair software from my pc and it finally worked. Just dont buy any DLC as they will not install I cannot find a fix for this. The base game is still worth it though! I rate 4 stars because the lack of being able to add DLC.,Jan 25 at 6:26 PM,4, 7,

2022-05-28 18:04:20.220616,Virtual_Rob,Works perfectly with Quest & air link/vd,"This game is awesome.   I love the new play style!   It makes you fell like your on stage playing a custom version of the song.   Yes, you can totally ruin the song by mashing buttons.   It takes some skill to make the song sound good and custom and I love it.    They do guide you through parts and suggest “cords”. The more I play the better I get and found myself just lost in the music jamming out.    For all the classic RB fans they kept that in the game as an option but I find myself wanting to play the new style.     

The only part that was a bit of a pain was getting the controller mounted right… I used rubber bands and it worked pretty good.   If you had a 3d printer you could design a holder pretty easily.    I think you can also get the oculus touch mount from oculus support but haven’t tried yet.

Harmonix, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE circle back to this one and create some more DLC!!!",Nov 3 at 3:00 AM,4, 10,
2022-05-28 18:04:20.234579,InsulinMan,Completely abandoned from launch.,"There are still fatal flaws and bugs that prevent you from playing this game. Completely ridiculous. The game is on version 1.01 all these years later. What a waste. This is the most uninspired, lazy creation.",Dec 1 at 10:06 AM,1, 4,
2022-05-28 18:04:20.249539,AnimeKing18,its good but support is not,I have a quest 2 and all i can say it works i had to redneck attack the quest 2 controller to the guitar but after fighting that the game is good i recommend picking this up for the rift cv1 owners but if you have a quest 2 be prepared to fight the controller to stay on the guitar,Sep 29 at 10:39 AM,4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:04:20.264499,dillpickle39,Long Time RB and GH fan,"Got a Quest 2 last year and a gaming PC this year, just remembered the Oculus exclusive title Rockband VR exists. 
Buys, 
plays, 
gets frustrated with guitar disconnecting every 3 seconds,
figures out is too far away from computer, 
profit.

Fun game that is like learning it from scratch all over again, would recommend if you even have a Rockband Guitar anymore!",Jan 28 at 10:45 AM,5, 0,
