The AI is excellent and you can also play VS. against people on other versions of the game. My big complaint is that the DLC purchased in the identical tablet version doesn't transfer into this game. It also crashes sometimes, not so much anymore, but it picks up right where it was when you restart.","Dec 20, 2019 at 10:38 AM",5, 3,

Sent a letter to the maker, and still no reply.  Hard to justify anything more than a single star when I can't get so much as a single screen to appear.","May 31, 2018 at 12:53 AM",1, 8,
