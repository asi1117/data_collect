2022-05-28 10:55:59.464402,Squidgamer,Family Friendly doom eternal,"I feel that this game really makes the most of VR and has the same blood hungry feel of the Doom franchise while being less gorey and more interactive. This feels like the perfect game, but there are some things that I feel are ""less than perfect."" To get upgrades for your weapons you need stars and to get stars you need to play levels and complete certain goals, this, while being good in concept, is a boring and drawn out. To get all the stars it's not uncommon to have to complete the same level over and over again. In all I think this game isn't necessarily a ""must have"", but it's definitly something to check out if you have the money.",Feb 13 at 12:41 PM,4, 13,
2022-05-28 10:55:59.479362,MallyDude,"Cool, but it has 1 issue","right this game is really cool and it makes you feel awesome when you grab ahold of a robot and tear it limb from limb. However, there is one thing that bothers me, and it REALLY bothers me: the movement. There is no smooth movement option. its ONLY teleporting and its so annoying, its so awkward and obtuse, literally every other VR game i have played has had smooth movement and either snap or smooth turning. not this game. this game has a movement system where you use the joystick to select the direction in which you wish to face BEFORE you teleport. (e.g. i point north and push the stick left to go north but face west) this system just irritates me to the point that i cant get into the groove, especially in the later levels when there are more enemies it just gets unnecessarily cumbersome to dodge stuff, heck you cant even jump. it gets on my nerves, big time. but if you dont get bothered by a terrible locomotion system then its totally worth a play.",Dec 25 at 4:18 AM,4, 112,

2022-05-28 10:56:02.631053,Xeroki41,Lots of fun. Death to robots.,"I've played through the main story now once. Working on unlocking all of my weapon options now. It has a good selection of weapons for the price and it can get very challenging if you want to shoot for high scores. The gunplay is solid and feels more refined than most of the VR games I've tried. Guns feel like they shoot where your pointing and controls feel pretty intuitive. 

My only complaint is the movement. You have to stop shooting with one hand and point at a spot while holding the stick to race a direction to move. This is very nice most of the time, but in the intense firefights it's a pain to move and dodge since you have to wait a second or two to confirm the movement. It's causes me to lose a lot of score when fighting in the most hectic fights.

Besides that one complaint, I truly think it's one of the best VR single shooters out there. Worth the $20.",Jan 14 at 9:53 PM,4, 7,
2022-05-28 10:56:02.647011,Coldsnap500,Amazing!,"This is a fairly short game, but omg it's slick! And the soundtrack is just mindblowingly awesome!

Edit: I see lots of negative comments about the locomotion system. I always found the thumbstick directional teleport much easier than snap/smooth turning, also faster and more comfortable. I tend to think of it as a teleport superpower. It IS a little dated though, and if you're used to smooth movement/turning it will take some time before it becomes second nature.",Jan 21 at 5:25 PM,5, 5,

2022-05-28 10:56:02.679923,DytonOculus,It is 'okay',"I honestly don't understand how people can give this 4-5 stars. The movement system is enough for me to want to put it down and go play ANY other shooter. 

There is zero variety in this game. It is completely one dimensional. Yes it is slick to look at and cool etc etc but all you do is frantically blast away at swarms of robots that, while easy to beat, just overwhelm you and make the gameplay feel really messy. The terrible movement system is truly exposed by the fact that they swarm you from 360 degrees and you are just twirling around like top fighting them all. That is okay if you're playing wirelessly but I use the link cable and it gets annoying very quickly. 

After all I've said I was going to give it 3 stars but the fact is all of the above means I won't play it past this review. 1 star.

I'm going back to Half Life, HHH, Boneworks, even CrisisVRigade is way better than this. May not look as shiney but it works a ton better. 

Oh, reloading, WHY isn't there reloading??? Why do I have to toss the gun and draw new ones from the holster every single time? Is that a glitch or something?? Either way, that also annoys me tothe point I don't want to play. The number of times I reached for my holster and drew nothing from it in the 40 minutes I played of this game was infuriating.  

If this game was under $10 then itr would be worth a squueze but at the higher pricepoint it is a rip off.",Jan 12 at 8:25 AM,1, 3,

Update: I found the solution on Reddit.  It has something to do with OpenSSL and newer generation CPUs.
Follow these steps:

Go to System --> Advanced System Settings --> Environment Variables (You might get to this differently in different versions of Windows)

In THE SECOND window (""System Variables"") click NEW

Enter name ""OPENSSL_ia32cap""

Enter value ""0x200000200000000""

Then click OK

You must REBOOT SYSTEM

2022-05-28 10:56:12.141020,Vivace78,Too short!!,"Hi!
I had a ""surprise"" to see how short it`s this game.
First,I was thinking something happened and the space installed on my computer is more less than the space required in presentation of the game.
After I checked , 9.32 Gb was the same space  installed on my computer.
When I saw the map with the missions,I was very excited to see that big map (in my mind,I was thinking I have a lot of missions to accomplish)
Of course ,I was very dissapointed to see ONLY 3 cities with 9 missions.
I was very surprised when appear to me the message ""thank you for playing RoboRecall"" and after that to see the credits.
I didn`t expect to finish the game so quickly with ONLY 15 % complete .
I mean ,I was thinking I have 15 %, untill 100 % is a long way( especially I saw that big map)
I reached   ONLY the level 9 and allready I finished the game:)))))
How is possible like this??!!( to not mention the things with the weapons,too).
I unlocked only the pistol with laser and extra ammo and shotgun with laser(that`s all).
Of course ,I can repeat the missions and I could play 30 years from now on,but I was preffering to see more missions.
Don`t get me wrong!! I don`t regret the money  spent on this game,but the game it could be more longer with more missions to accomplish.
I like very much this game.It is fantastic.
My only regret is that the game it`s too short.
I gave 4 stars and not 5 ,because the game it`s too short!!
Sorry for my english,but the english it`s not my mother language!!
I hope in the future ,you`ll develop another game like this ,or you could extend more this game through updates and bundles I guess it`s the correct term to say.",Aug 1 at 4:17 AM,4, 47,

After the first few levels, however, the game got repetitive: enemies were no longer a challenge, and the weapons weren't as exciting to wield. Don't let this review scare you away if you're looking for a quick, fast-paced experience; this games delivers exactly that!",Aug 3 at 1:16 AM,3, 3,
2022-05-28 10:56:15.321628,Cybermerlin,Want ya bullet back?,"The fun this game gives comes in many forms. First is the witty comments from the AIs and the robots. Second is the amount of destruction you can do to a robot. Ripping off its arms and legs before ripping off its head... you can't help but giggle. But it does not end there! No, you can throw the bits at other robots! Grab a robot and use it as a shield. Punch them around, throw them for miles. For a bit more fun you can pluck a bullet or rocket out of the air and throw it back! 

And then theres the tricks you can do with guns. You don't just shoot them... you can use them as tennis rackets and slap the bullets back.  

But it gets better...

Grab a robot and throw it in the air, punch it as it comes down and send it flying into other robots!
Shoot a robot point blank in the head and catch its gun as it flies up in the air then shoot another robot thats about to attack you!

My friends and I are experimenting with trick shots and fancy kills at the moment.

Oh yeah, theres a story line that is actually fun but you will find yourself replaying levels because of the ""I wonder if I can do this"" thoughts so you can try another way of killing robots. 
Maybe you ripped a robots head off and threw it at another one... now your thinking ""I wonder if that would have been as fun if I ripped its leg off and hit the other robot with it... can I hit a home run?""
and
""I need to try ad find out if I can toss a head into the air and hit it into the atmosphere like a baseball""

All in all a truely entertaining game.

Now, I'm going back into the game to see if I can pistol whip a robot...","Jun 13, 2021 at 8:40 PM",5, 29,

The way the game wants youy to turn is by telporting and selecting a direction to face when you teleport. This does not work in such a fast pace game. Maybe if doing a teleport slowed down time it would help. It has mods but I have not tried any yet. they might fix the issue.
Beyond that the combat is fun, fast and arcady (which is the point of the game). So its good but the constantly faceing the wrong direction is really annoying.","Apr 2, 2021 at 6:50 AM",4, 26,

2022-05-28 10:56:21.660548,vrcrazytownz,frustrating to play,"positive:
- game looks amazing with incredible graphics and animation and sound
- witty and hilarious dialogue throughout
- guns look, sound, and feel awesome

negative:
- you have to actually turn
- movement is super annoying, robots are attacking from all angles and you can only teleport
- the timed missions are frustrating
- the game pushes you to move through it way too fast, like slow down and let us enjoy the game
- while the missions aren't difficult to complete, the star system is ridiculous. 2 million points? How? I don't have a play area large enough to move freely enough to accomplish this
- no reload of weaons, seriously! You just grab new ones from your holster. Sounds easy right? Except it's very difficult to actually grab them fast enough and sometimes you end up grabbing the weapon you threw that was out of ammo! Ridiciulous design decision here.

Game feels like a wasted opportunity to me. They should allow full movement with controllers, slow the game down, and make it an actual game. They could have made it like gears of war while being linear, still alows you to move freely.","Feb 17, 2021 at 3:29 PM",3, 9,

2022-05-28 10:56:27.944287,alexbassguy,"Great gameplay, but very limited content","Playing on Quest 2.  Pretty decent game - fun challenges, great controls and gameplay.  The big problem - there are all of 9 levels in the main game, each of which can be completed in less than 10 minutes.  And even at that, they repeat in three sets, so there's essentially 3 levels with slight variations in setting and challenge level.  It's basically elimination, then defend the flag, then boss fight - repeat that 3 times, you're done.   It is an arcade-style game, but I was extremely surprised about how little content there is here.  All levels essentially look the same.  Visual quality is great, but the genereic 'futuristic city' backdrop in every level gets stale fast.  Even with replaying the levels multiple times to try to do better, I easly finished the game in about 3 hours.  Playing aggrestively straight through would have taken two hours at most.  There are only 4 weapons, again with minor mods and variations.  The combat does get creative with melee options.  Dialog is well-done and quite entertaining, and what little story is has is fun and well-written.  Kids will LOVE this game, but if you're looking for a title that will entertain an older user for an extended period of time, this is decidedly not it.  Once you've completed the challenges, there isn't much of anything to come back for.  Overall, it's fun, very comfortable, great visuals and solid controls - but really short, pretty repetitive and gets boring quickly.","Jan 10, 2021 at 7:47 AM",3, 7,

. Fast paced shooter
. The best reloading I have ever done
. Very good graphics
. You can take off their body parts which I really like because no game has that like barely any games￼￼￼


Non positive

. Even though the teleporting doesn’t work like I have trouble with it

Since 90% of all PC VR HMDs are connected to a machine via a cable, this is absolutely mind baffling. We all (including every developer) know, that those cables will eventually break somewhere, once you turn and twist them one time too often, consequentually rendering the HMD useless. Cable repleacements for the most common headsets are a nightmare. 

Other than that, this experience is truly fun and well done. But playing with the knowlegde that I am probably ruining my headset during it sadly makes this not recommendable.","Feb 6, 2021 at 6:51 AM",1, 5,

The characters are all hilarious and memorable, with witty commentary coming from your AI companion as well the Robots which you ""Recall"" by killing them. The enemy robots themselves are actually quite intelligent, both in terms of actual AI and character. The controls are very fluent and intuitive, having you draw from the hips for pistols, or reach over the shoulder for shotguns. As well as this, you can grab enemies, remove limbs, shoot held enemies in the face, throw enemies into other enemies, and more. This is easily one of the best VR shooters I've ever played, due to the humor and highly interactive controls. Buy this game.","Feb 26, 2021 at 10:58 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 10:56:43.761181,MrDeadshot,Fun core gameplay devoid of content,"Shooting guns and destroying robots has rarely felt and looked so good in VR - especially on PC, but for Quest standards, the graphics are still very good. Dual wielding shotguns, pistols, revolvers and energy rifles, dodging bullets in slow motion and grabbing rockets and sending them back to the enemy certainly makes you feel like a superhero. Unfortunately, there are two big problems with this game. 

The first one, where you can get used to, but still feels out-dated in nowadays VR worlds is the teleport only movement. You can only get around the levels by holding an analogue stick and pointing to the area you want to instant warp. You can also change your viewing direction while doing this by turning the analogue stick. 

The much bigger problem is the content. There are only three areas with three missions each. All of these missions take place in the same looking city. There are basically only rooftops, alleyways and streets. There are only four weapons to choose from and not much variation in the enemies. The third stage of each area is the same boss fight with little variation. It took me 2,5 hours to play through all of the levels and even in that short time the game became repetitive. I also had to do some replays because my Guardian crashed during gameplay and there is no way to manually adjust your heigh. So I was stuck a few centimetres above the ground and the game became unplayable. Overall this feels like the first act of a much bigger game, but unfortunately, it just ends. Sure, you can always play for high scores and hunt stars to unlock more weapons, but that's not everybody's cup of tea and we can expect more content from a 29,99€ game.","Aug 16, 2020 at 5:10 AM",3, 16,

You can grab the robots and pull them apart. Use them as a weapon. Catch bullets out of the air and throw them back. Deflect shots back to the robots, using your guns. Oh and you can just shoot them.

2022-05-28 10:57:12.140904,Belchro,Robot Recall - immensely fun FPS game.,"Robot Recall is a fun and intuitive game that has the player ""recalling"" robots all over the city.

The player has multiple maps to choose from and while the game has you doing mostly the same thing all the time, I find myself enjoying myself for hours on end. The mechanics are great, and picking up guns from my back or belt feels amazing. You get a nice selection of guns, being pistols, shotguns, energy rifles and revolvers. You can attach various attachments to all the weapons and the game allows the player to manually attach the attachments which makes it feel really good. I don't think I've ever been so satisfied attaching things to a gun.

Personally, here is my opinion on the individual bits of the game:

Gameplay - 5/5
Story - 5/5 (although - there really isn't much)

i like shooters and this puts you in the game.  the teleport works well.  it aint star trek holodeck, but you have to get around somehow.  lol
you can dodge bullets.  trust me, shoot  things before they jump on your head.  
you will thank me later.

game is smooth. weapons respond. visual quality is very good.

be careful.. the better you get, the more things going on and the closer to the action you get.  the result.. CRASH!!!!!  I played for hours in the beginning with no issues.  the more i play the quicker i crash it. im dodging, holding robots in one hand and a gun in the other and flicking bullets away and teleporting.  the result,  CRASH!!!!

2022-05-28 10:57:18.516142,UsernameToChange,Best VR game,"There are a few good VR games out there, I'm not convinced by the rest. But this game is the best VR game/experience I have had with the Oculus Rift so far. The interactions with the game environment are so natural that you learn pretty fast all the possible interactions. With this rich repertoire of interactions you have one of the best in-game immersion and feeling of freedom. This is what every VR game should aim for.

I also want to stress that locomotion via teleportation is a great choice, and I fully disagree with reviews that complain about it. To my opinion, the game would clearly not reach the satisfaction levels I get with the teleportation, for two reasons. First, like many people, regular in-game ""walking"" is often a source of motion sickness in VR games. With teleportation, I can play the game for hours without problem. Second, teleportation makes you feel very powerful, like omnipresent. You can pop up behind enemies, shoot them in the head, and jump from enemy to enemy at high speed since time slows down when you start teleporting. Maybe I was a bit disoriented at first, but it never really was an issue, since I don't remember it. Once you master teleportation, it feels very powerful.","Nov 4, 2019 at 8:49 AM",5, 36,

I usually prefer smooth locomotion, but the teleporation never bothered me in this game, it was executed very well (I think they were the first to give control over which way you will face after teleporting denoted by the arrow you can spin). The graphics are still next level on Rift with all of the particle effects. On Quest it loses some of it's beauty but keeps the fun and gameplay nearly identical.

2022-05-28 10:57:24.864826,OneManPosse,The best VR game I've played yet,"The reason I'm giving Robo Recall four stars instead of five is because it's really short; you can easily finish it in an evening (with a few breaks between missions).  That is the ONLY reason I'm not giving it five stars.  This is the best VR experience I've ever had.  And it is highly replayable; the game pretty much begs you to replay every mission until you max it out . . . which I guess makes it more of a 30-hour game. rather than a 3-hour game.

So, like many others, I bought a HMD for SUPERHOT VR.  This game absolutely crushes it.  Don't get me wrong; definitly buy SUPERHOT VR because it's incredible, but Robo Recall is just so empowering!  Grabbing enemies and slamming them against the ground, slamming them into each other, throwing them into the air, using them as ""human"" shields, using them as literal weapons (because, they have guns) . . .  the shear interactivity of the world is incredible!

And the guns.  Don't even get me started.  You can customize your loadout however you see fit, and you get upgrades for all your guns.  It does feel a bit lackluster; some folks have complained that there really aren't enough guns, and I totally agree.  However, if you're not happy with the guns, I'd like to point you to the free modkit you can download via UnrealEngine, where you can make your own guns.  Seriously, problem solved.

As PieroLeFou said in an earlier review, the teleportation mechanic is critical to how you play the game:  being able to teleport behind enemies — there is a cool-down to how often you can teleport — is an integral and tactical part of gameplay.  You need to utilize it.

On a side note, I found this game to be very intense, as in, I had to take breaks every two or three levels.  That's not a bad thing by any means, but I feel like you really need to be physically fit to enjoy the whole experience.  Maybe that's just me and my play-style, because I seriously got into it.  My thumbs started hurting after a while from rubbing on the controls","Nov 11, 2019 at 2:17 PM",4, 13,

You can replay a lot to unlock achievements and mods/weapons, and you can even mod the game, but I suggest to release more levels.

It's a no-brainer: this game turns you into what is basically a demi god, whose objective is to teleport around shooting robots and ripping them apart. You can catch litteral bullets with your hands.

The graphics is polished and I like the feeling of teleporting around in a futuristic city (I wish one day a proper open world VR). This is a game easy to learn and difficult to master, where you need several play through to reach a scorethat is comparable with global rankings. There is the possibility of modding the game, although I haven't managed to make it work with mods, yet.

2022-05-28 10:57:50.213496,uno.aphex,"Love game, hate controls","I love every aspect of this game, visuals, gun play, sounds  etc but what I really cant stand is the lack of native locomotion support. Teleportation is my least favorite method of movement in games and the teleportation in this game is far more disorienting than any locomotion I've ever used. Yeah you can get a mod that adds support but it kills achievements and is also a subpar locomotion that would be great if the devs gave us proper locomotion support. This game is so freaking amazing using locomotion over the ugly teleportation system that almost always messes me up trying to remember where I'm facing when I do actually teleport. It just feels unnatural. I feel lack of locomotion is basically a deal breaker for how important it is to vr gameplay it breaks my heart to not want to pick this game up as much as I'd like to.","Aug 26, 2019 at 9:23 AM",3, 3,

My only complaint is how short the campaign actually is. However if you take into account all of the goals you need to 100% this game it actually makes the campaign very long. Some of these goals can be very difficult and take some time and patience.","Aug 18, 2019 at 9:58 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 10:57:59.679542,pantsmode,"Short & buggy, but worth it.","If you were going into Robo Recall with the train of thought of shooting robots and doing crazy enemy juggling and gun tricks from all angles, as the trailer showed, you'd be correct. Just requires that you don't have a handicap, as the seated teleporting controls are not the best. If you're standing however, and especially so if you have a 360-degree play space, it should work just fine.

Onto more issues.

The game fails to load half the time. It gives me the loading screen as I'm about to go into a level, and then it just keeps me there. I can look around, do whatever, but it still stays there. This might just be a problem with my specs, as my PC is a 'VR-ready' pre-built.

The story is just godawful. And I know this isn't a main draw for people, let's be honest. The trailer shows just that, and from the HUGE BELLOWING VOICE yelling out the title at the end, it just wraps it in a nice little bow. 
No, I much more mean the villain's motivations.
Do you really need a spoiler warning? Just don't read past this if you need to observe the story first-hand for some ungodly reason, you weirdo.

It's memes. Actually. For real. No hyperbole, it's memes.
Mind you, this isn't new memes like the dab thing or the Fortnites. Which, I can't tell is better or worse.
Doge, cat memes, all that 2008-2011 'memery' is pretty much the sole reason the villain is, well, the villain.
You know that part in the trailer where a robot says that he doesn't want to serve or something? Thought that'd be encorporated into the story, that staple of uprising conflicts?
Nah. Memes.

Whatever, I can get over it by just modding the voices out. I think. Don't quote me on that.","Aug 19, 2019 at 8:35 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 10:57:59.715445,Decorion,This IS the best VR game around,"I have owned the rift for over a year and have bought and played many VR games. But it's strange how something so simple, and without multiplayer, is so darn good. From the music, to the graphics, to the motion, EVERY aspect of this game was well designed. I recieved it for free, but would have paid upwards of $50 for this. 

  Many people may disagree, but other games like Skyrim and Fallout are better outside VR. This is the best experience you can have in VR currently if you just want to mess around for a few hours. The replayability is insane! Unlocking weapons and their attachments feels like a welcome reward. The only negative thing I would have to say is that it does not have multiplayer capabilities. 

  If this game had a co-op mode, I would play nothing else for hours on end(with exception of VR breaks). Its simple on the story, but for what it lacks, the fluidity of the controls make up for it. The game possesses Matrix bullet time with the ability to catch and rethrow bullets!!! You can also rip robots apart and steal their weapons and kill them with it. The vortexs in-game are my favorite thing. You'll know when you get there.

  Bottom line: This is what VR is and should be. Most VR content is short and neat, but not worth your hard earned money. If you're new to VR and do not have this, YOU NEED IT! If you do not have this game at all and play VR, YOU NEED IT! Sometimes I feel like I could live in the game and be perfectly content....","Aug 7, 2019 at 1:48 AM",5, 3,

Recently got the new Rift S and found out that unfortunately the game isn't updated for it, it shows the old touch controllers (not a big deal), but the big thing is it doesn't track your position in real life realitive to the game like it used to.  That may sound strange, let me give an example.

Ex:  If I'm shooting something, then take two steps to my right to say dodge a bullet or melee an enemy, the game still thinks I'm in the original position before the two steps but only for teleporting.  So now I'm two steps to the right of where I started, lets say I point my teleport to go straight infront of  an enemy, well I'll be two steps to the right of infront of that enemy.  Basically its not tracking my posistion in the game properly, it's playing as if I'm standing in one spot and never moving at all.","Jun 23, 2019 at 3:46 PM",2, 10,

2022-05-28 10:58:28.138849,ImTylerDurden,Oh My,"The best shooter experience so far in VR. The fast, frenzied and epic experience that is RoboRecall truly shines when, for the first time, you teleport behind a robot, grab its body, use it as a shield against a point blank shotgun shot, rip off the robot’s head and sling its body halfway across the map before reaching both hands behind your shoulders and pulling out twin shotguns only to unload every round into the robot in front of you. 

Every time I play this game, my cable (suspended by the ceiling) is twisted up a million and one times from spinning around the room with twin pistols and shotguns blasting baddies as if I’m John Wick meets Neo. The absolute power trip this game gives you is unreal. 

While the game is a bit short on content, you’re incentivized to replay missions after receiving weapon upgrades to achieve more stars and higher scores. This kind of replayability is something I almost never do in video games, but RoboRecall is so much fun that I will gladly continue replaying missions.","Jun 3, 2019 at 2:01 AM",5, 0,

There’s a lack of story here but I believe it’s on purpose to keep the game fast pace and arcade-like. The combat system has so much detail, you have so many options at your disposal. Your gun ran out of ammo? Toss it at a robot’s face. Bullets coming right at you? Catch them and throw them back. About to take a punch? Grab the robot and rip its arm off.

It's tons of fun and the game utilizes VR amazingly. I had some issues with lag on a few occasions but it may have been my hardware that caused it. The issue was more or less taken care of when I reduced some of the graphical settings. The game still looked amazing and I didn't notice any difference. You can repeat a mission as many times as you would like, in order to achieve the stated goals at the beginning of the mission. The fact that the combat was fun, makes me want to keep playing even more.

The only thing I would add, is the ability to rotate without having to teleport. And perhaps more of a variety when it comes to weapons and environments. However, the game is still solid and I would definitely recomend. It's well worth the money. I would play it for longer periods of time, but the game serves as a great workout as well. I'm dreading the muscle pains I'll have tomorrow morning. I've only had my headset for a few weeks, but this is the best VR game I've played so far. GET IT!","May 30, 2019 at 2:21 PM",5, 0,

Overall it is just a very polished, very fun, and very immersive VR game.  However, apart from replaying the same missions over and over to try to get higher scores, it doesn't have much content.  It does support modding, but unfortunately because it came out in the early days of VR, modders just weren't interested so there is very little out there and nothing that adds significant content.  Shame that Epic didn't ever add more content or sell some DLC.  Most people will get this free anyway so I can't say it isn't ""worth"" it.  It is a fantastic but  woefully short experience.

2022-05-28 10:59:03.072413,BigSparky,,"I've been playing games since I had Pong as a kid in the 70's. Robo Recall is one of the most immersive and interactive experiences I've ever played. There's so much you can do and so many ways to do it. The gunplay is extremely well done, allowing you to pull off every insane action-movie stunt ever.

I had three robots coming at me, two crawlers behind them. Took one shotgun from over my shoulder and took one's head off. I Immediately swung the shotgun and deflected about five bullets before throwing it and grabbing another bot and ripping it's head from it's torso. Threw the head at one crawler and blew it up. Used the torso as a shield as the next crawler jumped at me. Used the torso to smash the crawler at my feet. Last bot I just grabbed both pistols from my belt and unloaded until he collapsed. 

That whole scenario unfolded in a matter of seconds, and it was as natural and real as anything I've ever experienced in any arcade or theme park attraction. This is what people would wait in line for hours to experience for just 3 minutes. Robo Recall is an exceptional game that shouldn't be missed by anyone who has a Rift and Touch controllers - truly what VR was made for.","Mar 2, 2019 at 5:48 PM",5, 1,

Regardless that I've played every mission multiple times I still enjoy this game even if its just for one round to finish off the night.  I do wish there were more levels or DLC's from the creators.  Everything about this game is so well done I will always be hungry for more.

I would like to make one point that brings me back to this game for FPS fun: I'm killing robots and there isn't any blood.  Its not that I'm squeamish but rather I am an Iraq combat veteran with PTSD.  When I play FPS where I shoot humans or even zombies, particularly when there is a big splash of blood when an enemy is hit, it tugs on memories that make me mentally and physically very ""uncomfortable.""  This may be a small or inconsequential thing to most people but for me it means the difference between a playable and non-playable game.  So my hats off to the creators for making a bloodless game.","Oct 1, 2018 at 12:30 PM",5, 664,

Yes, I've not solved it on hard mode yet, but I am learning more about all the different ways you can kill robots... Throwing the guns at them is fun, as is beating them up with their own arms. The graphics are AMAZING, try teleporting on top of a car, ledge or what not and you really feel like you're above the action. And yes, I get into it highly, by ducking, moving sideways to avoid bullets, and even crouching down to make myself a smaller target, and it all works!

The one problem with it being a modder's paradise is that there's not a lot of handholding. Luckily mostly all the game is viewable from it's mod editor (gotten from the Epic Game's launcher, not Home) so if you REALLY want to, you can dig into their files and pretty much figure out how everything works, but there are few guides available to help newcomers to Unreal Engine get started modding this game. I've made a couple myself (look for RavenX185 on Instructables if you're interested) to help people get started though, because I absolutely love making mods for this game. Once you figure out how the various systems work, it's very easy to plop new models in place of the basic weapons and create your own awesome gameplay on new maps! Just takes a bit of learning. Overall, this game is solid in every way, and I can't wait to see the modding community grow. It has amazing potential, just takes a bit to get started.","Dec 3, 2018 at 5:41 AM",5, 8,

I have to go to the missions to even play the game, in my opinion this game would be alot more fun if we had Open World. The reason why i want this is because we always have to go back to the missions to play the game.

Anyways, if open world comes out, you could make it like every so often an event happens like protect this or kill those robots over there and bring em up into the gigantic blimp above us, you could add events that are based on the things you have to do in Story Mode.

You could turn this into an MMO with people that you can see in Open World, maybe even add customization so you can look fancy and stuff.

We also need some more weapons, theres not alot of weapons in this game, you could add a minigun that goes on your back and requires 2 hands, you could add laser whips that stick to your pockets (i would love that), or you could add melee weapons.

If you agree with me, thumbs up.

The kids can play, too, since theres no blood. And my favorite part, is that you can get the Epic Games launcher, and get a mod kit! The SDK package is really fun to mess around with. I highly recommend this game!! Edit: I would enjoy a co-op PVE (maybe with a seperate campaign) and it would be awesome if there was a version for the Vive, (Maybe make them pay for it, since Oculus users had to get the Touch) to cross-play with Oclulus players.

In addition, the game is too short and i have the feeling that this is almost a demo for a potential AAA game rather than a complete title.

I will add that, I understand the movement mechanics being really good for getting behind opponents, however, if it had an open movement system, it would potentially be more awesome, I ain't sure though since I ain't sure how it would affect enemy mechanics.

2022-05-28 10:59:41.048334,mdrejhon,Needs to be pack-in game for roomscale!,"This needs to be a branded boxwrap on a full 3-sensor roomscale kit. This is the perfect roomscale game to introduce longtime PC gamers to virtual reality gaming. 

Whether you're an FPS fan normally not interested in virtual reality -- or get very sick on rollercoasters -- TRY this game.  This game is optimized to be very comfortable in roomscale VR.  

For the biggest thrill -- strongly recommend you have 3 sensors and run in roomscale mode. This ONE game is worth the CAD$100 for a 3rd sensor!! 

My roomscale is a very tight 5x7 foot in the middle of a cluttered room, and I never once accidentally hit anything outside my roomscale. There's a VR marker below you so you know your calculated flailing, dodges and all, doesn't hit physical objects. To VR newbies, that ""Star Trek Holodeck"" grid automatically appears when I get too close to my desk or bookshelves lining my room, so you're safe and quickly step back to the holographic centre marker representing the center of your physical room, safely away from all the clutter. While I recommend a bigger roomscale space for the optional (but MUST-PLAY!) roomscale mode for this game, it's certainly very playable in a 5x7 and it still felt very open-world, with those skyscrapers towering realistically above me.,

Also... If you run it in roomscale mode in higher difficulties, it becomes bonus intense exercise as you actually DODGE many incoming bullets (from the robots) by moving side to side.  Frantically trying to shoot two approaching robots at the same time with two guns -- one aimed independently in each hand!  Aiming separately with two guns in separate directions!  Imagine doing FPS with two computer mice with two crosshairs.  That is FPS to a new ""dimension"" (Pun intended! Get it!).  And I never once felt nauseous.  

This VR game is well done, yet exciting, that even the motion-sick can dare to give it a try -- even you ""VR ride haters"" that tried VR FPS once (e.g. Half Life 2 VR version) -- give this game a try.","Dec 10, 2018 at 6:04 AM",5, 0,

I played all 9 levels then it just ended. A game this good needs to have more levels. Gameplay is awesome, so is the graphics. Overall, if you are using revive and you need to buy it, don't... unless you have a ton of money to blow on VR games.

2022-05-28 10:59:50.576095,Zaccooo,An experience,"This game is one of my favourite games in vr and so well put together making anything a wepon and just destroying robots is fun and with lots of levels and over a couple hours of gameplay its a great purchase (not that i has to pay anthing with it being free) but also the free price tag makes it more favorable to the vr newbies who want the best vr can offer and this is it.

The actual gameplay is mainly including beating up waves of robots and different kinds : Melee bots, pistol bots , shotgun bots, wierd rocket bots, large TANK like bots you can get behind and use its laser to destroy! and there are others but reading a list is much more boring than actual playing.

The array of wepons you can use is great! Use duel pistols or a shotgun (even rifles) and all the guns have attachments you unlock at certain points. You can also use robot parts such as their own arms or heads to beat them or other robots up! Most of all is the bullets, the matrix comes to vr! Whn a robot shoots at you everything slows down and your able to move yourself to dodge the bullets and even grab one midair and throw it back.. i know sounds crazy but the mechanic works so well.

In the end just give it a try with it being free whats to hate if you don't like it and if you do ; Enjoy.","Nov 23, 2018 at 6:48 AM",5, 0,

You'll get a hang of the basic controlls rather quick and the action is so immersive it impresses everybody, especially the jump scare in the intro gets everybody pumped up. Having all the robots up in your face really makes the game feel immersive.

There are not many levels, but it doesn't really get boring to redo them and gather more points, cooler kills, and weapon upgrades. The levels and story is also engaging and even though the game restricts the area for each level you rarely experience this restriction and it feels quite open.

The weapons are amazing and very responsive. Grabbing the shotgun from your back was a great touch, although I felt the shotgun was not as amazing as it could have been (or maybe I'm just a bad shot). 

Teleporting in order to move around gets rid of the uncomfort when moving, and it is a great extra in the game. Once you get a hang of the teleportation you can move around very quick while killing robots and avoid getting hit.","Nov 4, 2018 at 10:00 PM",5, 4,

The story is just enough to give you some context to the swarms of robots you will be 'reclaiming'. The progression mechanics are just enough to keep me playing to earn all the acheivements to unlock more attachements for the guns. 
The star of the show however are the controlls. I feel like this is going to be looked back on in the same way we look at the original Doom. Sure there are other shooters in VR with similar controll setups but this feels like the way forward.

The games only real weekeness is a lack of content. The limited variety in robots and locations can get a little stale. The soundtrack is excelent and well suited but very short. You are going to be over the few tracks ingame within the hour and you'll be wishing there was an ingame spotify player.

All in all, this is the kind of game that VR has been waiting for. Something dedicated to the platform that doesn't just feel like a neat tech demo or an 'experience' to show off the hardware. This is the Super Mario Galaxy to the Wii's Wii Sports","Sep 22, 2018 at 11:09 PM",5, 7,

My machine is a little low-end, I get the ""Your computer doesn't meet Rift's minimum specs"" message all the time in the menu and store. This game runs flawlessly, with high-end graphic options on even this budget PC.

It FEELS good to play, reaching over your shoulder for a back-mounted shotgun one minute, reaching down to your side holster for a pistol the next. Throwing said spent pistol at an incomming robot, to then have the gun richochette off the robot, back into your reach fully reloaded is just.. beautiful. And not to mention you can LITTERALLY RIP ROBOTS INTO PIECES BY HAND.

Controls work great, the game looks fabulous, and it all flows really well.

The developers tried to make it ""less hostile"" by giving them an absurd comical voice but it ends up making the whole situation rather weird and uncomfortable for my brain to comprehen. Moving around by teleporting just isn't right or intuitive. You end up losing your bearings especially when things get heated up it just causes a lot of confusion. For me I think the only way to enjoy this game is to ignore all natural instinct to comprehen your enviroment/situation and just shoot like a mad man. The scenes are beautiful and I wish I could explore it but the teleportation method of moving around plus the constant fear of evil robots trying to kill you just destroys the experience!

More More More. Some minor frustrations cross platform using revive. Vive handles turning better, so there should be an option to disable trackpad turning, also, teleport is a little fiddly.

The single most well polished and entertaining game in my growing library, I love playing Robo Recall. When you first start playing you can feel a bit overwhelmed, but once you're comfortable with teleporting around, grabbing enemies, throwing weapons for a reload, catching and throwing back bullets, and so many other cool features, you really start to feel like you've got some serious talent! 
The game runs very smoothly and does a fantastic job in really immersing you. My only real complaint is not noticing enemies from behind when they sometimes walk through the player, which sends you jumping.","Apr 14, 2018 at 4:34 AM",5, 3,

Most hardware is purchased with the assumption of additional funds being required to truly enjoy the new investment. Robo Recall truly solidifed my resolve in my purchasing decision, with the very well optimized combat, funny (and intentionally dated at times) humor, all the way to the quite frankly brilliant movement system that encourages the player to play to the Oculus' strengths and downplay its weakpoints (with a two-sensor setup primarily).

How you guys made  a use for teleport with the mobs is awesome, teleporting behind enemies in a flash makes me feel like an X-Men with teleport capabilities, now i feel like Mightcrawler coming behind is enemies and unarming them, or leaping behings robots wiht huge shields, wasn'T sure about teleporting at first, but got to say, developement teams that finds a way to use the teleporting like this  make sme like it, doesn't get me more immertion to walk around by moving my thumbstick while being in VR, since my legs aren't moving more than when i teleport. :) Just makes me feel like moving around a wheel chair, so, i don't mind teleporting.

The attention to detail is one of the aspects that sets it apart from other games. While it's a shooter, it allows you to do just about anything you want in terms of destroying robots. Shooting? Of course. Grabbing a bullet that's been shot at you and tossing it back? Yep. Grabbing an opponent and throwing them at another opponent? Sure, with unique effects based on what type of opponent you grabbed. Ripping a robot's arm off and beating it with it? Naturally. Throwing a gun at an enemy when you run out of bullets? Yep, and it reloads the gun which then bounces back for you to catch.

As far as ""badass factor"" goes, Robo Recall is far and away the best game to date.","Jan 24, 2018 at 11:53 AM",5, 4,

Pros:

*Amazing graphics
*Consistent gun shooter system
*No gore
*Mod compatibility
*HTC Vive compatibility(with Revive)
*Challenging Boss battle system
*Accurate throwing motions( a lot of games need that)
*Great controller haptic advantages
*The game is free for purchase

Cons: 

*Only a few in-game levels
*No active movement(Example:Sairento Vr has A LOT of active movement)
*No locomotion options
*Little enemy diversity

Conclusion: Overall, I think that this game needs a couple tweaks here and there, but other than that I'll give this the honor of being the BEST shooter on the Oculus Store.","Jan 23, 2018 at 10:31 AM",5, 1,

You really fight for a good high score. And it's challeging to earn some of the stars (Which is a good thing). You can use the stars to upgrade your weapons AKA ""requires 31 stars to unlock"".

2022-05-28 11:02:58.644144,LuluViBritannia,"Fun, but not very well done.","Robo Recall is very fun to play, and the graphics are gorgeous. But two things bring it down. First, the teleportation system is totally messed up : the arrow which appears during the teleportation process is NOT the direction you are looking at (because it is the direction between you and your sensors). This isn't a problem as long as you face your sensors... but in VR, you turn around! Basically, whenever you move, you can move the direction of the arrow (so basically you change the orientation of the VR world around you, relatively to the real world). So you teleport, and the world changed its orientation, but not you. This is really disorienting, and thus, unusable. For example : you want to teleport in front of a robot. What do you do? You try to teleport in front of it, and you turn the arrow so that it faces the robot (that's the instinct choice). BUT the arrow is not actually the direction you're looking at! So instead of winding up facing the robot, you'll wind up facing on its left, or even in the opposite direction... The second problem is : the game is not optimized. The worst is, the program doesn't clean its data during a mission. When you start the mission, it's fine, the game is smooth. But the longer you play the mission, the more data, and as the game keeps all of it, the more power it needs. In the end, you wind up with a huge drop in framerate, and that's absolutely awful. Because of those two problems, I can't give it a good mark. But it is really fun, so I still advise to try the game! If you want a fun FPS, there are plenty others, who won't have the technical problems Robo Recall has.","Nov 18, 2017 at 9:30 PM",3, 3,"Hi, LuluViBritannia. If you go into the Robo Recall in-game menu to ""Settings"" and select ""Tracking Options"" there's a setting called ""360 Tracking"" and ""Use Teleport Direction"" that will allow the directional arrow to match your facing direction. This will address your first concern. Regarding your performance loss, can you provide more details? We've not see this drop off in any of our testing and have optimized the game to run at the Oculus recommended min-spec. There are graphic settings that can be adjusted for certain systems if needed.

The game would be perfect in my eyes if they did away with the shallow leveling system and one dimensional weapon upgrades and gave us more weapon and level variety.

Still, even with that criticism the game is just plane fun. You are given a hundred ways to destroy the robots and each one is a treat to do. You can spend hours on the same level just trying new ways to get a higher score and that is where the game shines.

BUT front-facing mode doesn't do it justice. You really need roomscale to be immersed in it, wouldn't recommend stationary. Also hipfire and quick shots without reticle aiming is a bit off compared to real guns: In my opinion the Oculus touch controllers, while leaps ahead of the other VR controllers, lack the correct allignment of pistol grips to be truly accurate long range. The feel of the grip's angle isn't a 100%. It shows when you're taking even 20-meter shots at a moving target, I find that without a conscious correction my shots go a few degrees above the intended point. A pet peeve maybe but this game is fast pace enough for it to matter. I'd like to see some sort of aiming option for manual reallignment.
All and all a great game and highly recommended.","Nov 17, 2017 at 5:03 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 11:03:37.045184,onceinAwhile,"good game, but not excellent","I see a lots of 5 stars, not sure if they are for the gorgeous environments and overall graphic, because the game itself is a good game but not a 10 out of 10 for sure.
You walk around with teleport; which is something that I don't like, especially when you are facing enemies coming all the way around you; it is fundamentally a FPS in waves, and having freedom of movement would have been better, but I understand that people get sick when moving around in VR, so kudos for making the game accessible.
Aiming is a bit off; projectiles for some reasons have mass; and gravity seems to be 5x the usual 9.8m/s on Earth; which result in bullets going down if you aim straight where you should. VR is fun because it is like handling a real item; but this means that you need to pay more attention to how an item works and react, otherwise you break the immersion. For a casual user, the shooting is fun, and 1 star goes just for the fact that you can throw back bullets or dismantle robots that get too close. Fun game to play, it is in the top 5 games for VR so far, and well done.","Nov 17, 2017 at 11:31 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 11:04:02.680982,konoisgod,Great game with a few errors,"A good game with outstanding grapics, good gameplay with a few problems. For a start, it ends quite abruptly and isn't as long as I would've liked it to be. One or two hours of story, and then it's just replaying the same levels to beat your score. Not a very wide selection of guns to choose from, and I wouldn't say all of the guns are perfect. For one, with the ""fully automatic lazer rifle"", it is very hard to aim as you use only one hand to hold it. I feel that seeing as the whole point of this game is for it to be a shooter game where you shoot things with guns, they should make the shotgun and the lazer rifle be grippable with two hands. For another, the levels are a bit too long. By the end of one or two levels I will have already broken a sweat and have achey eyes and have to have a 15 minute break. However, if you are good at jumping around and shooting robots for half an hour or so with one-handed guns, then go ahead, this game is for you. I personally love the game, just wanted a two-handed grip mechanic and some more gameplay - but who knows, maybe they're making more levels as you read this.","Nov 3, 2017 at 1:33 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 11:04:02.704918,foxifox,Sweet but short,"Robo Recall is a brilliant demonstration of how to implement VR FPS. The gun-play is exceptional and enemy interaction with weapon and melee is very well done and impressive.

The only two major flaws is the lenght of the game, you think you've just gotten to the first boss of the first chapter/area, but it turns out to be the final boss... Not sure if there is even more then an hour or two of gameplay if you're an experienced FPS player. (Although the game has great replay value.)

The locomotion ""teleporting"" system can be a fun addition to the combat at times, but mostly its just really really annoying and dosen't work well at all for sitting down and playing. The game NEEDED to have the OPTION to use the joysticks on the touch controllers to ADJUST movement and orientation. This is a huge fail and takes away so much from what otherwise is the most impressive VR tech-demo out there.

Despite the shortcomings I give the game 4/5 since it was included for free with the touch controllers and is overall very very well crafted.","Nov 3, 2017 at 2:35 AM",4, 0,

So glad that I did as it has revamped my enthusiasm and faith in the VR industry.  Awesome game smooth graphics, its obviously not going to be as richly detailed as general PC games and same for the length.  But this is to be expected and people who seem to want more really dont understand the industry and market at the moment.

It has very good gameplay, it feels like the Dev's thought of everything, even when you let a weapon fall to the ground you don't need to pick it up again you just point at it and it flies back into your hand if you grab. There is absolutely challenge to be had in the game as well, the difficulty ramps up over time, i do not have a lot of room, can only play seated, the later levels absolutely require a bit more movement to evade bullets for example so i have not beaten the game yet.

It is not multiplayer (well, not as of writing this review anyhow), but this game, along-side Dead and Buried, is a must have. Another perfect execution of a VR game for a very enjoyable experience. Other devs won't be able to match this anytime soon. Robo Recall set the bar at a new height for VR games. Plus, trust me, you'll get some exercise playing this.","Sep 9, 2017 at 10:12 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 11:05:22.809436,SmithFamVR,A must-have for VR,"This is a great game that really showcases what VR can do. The physics are 10/10, graphics 10/10, and while the story and levels leave a little to be desired, they are still really, really good. There is also a good deal of replayability, as most people (myself included) probably won't finish the game with 50/50 stars. The weapon system is great; with 2 different weapons for each holster (Pistol and Revolver for side, Shotgun and Energy Rifle for back), and the way that you can choose what to upgrade the weapons with is great. The fact that this comes FREE with the Oculus Touch bundle is ridiculous, and I definately would have paid for this if it wasn't included. Pick it up if you didn't get it with the Touch bundle, you won't regret it!","Aug 25, 2017 at 4:27 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 11:05:22.835366,cdrothschild,A VR masterpiece that never gets old!,"This is a great game with a lot of replay value, for reasons similar to why Mario is replayable: It encourages you to keep doing even better on the same levels, by finding new ways to do the same thing. There are so many different ways to defeat each enemy, and so many ways to raise your score, that I don't think I could ever get bored with this game entirely. It's not too challenging, but not too easy either, and the controls aren't too hard to get used to. The game feels pretty immersive as well, although it isn't overly intense despite that fact, because the game has sort of it's own campy style of humor that doesn't take away much from immersion, but also makes immersion in the game feel tolerable and not overwhelming. This could have easily been very different though, given the entire game entails being surrounded hordes of killer robots.

Also, the best part (in my opinion) is the levels can be pretty short, making it a great game to play in between doing other things! That alone has made this game one that I keep coming back to all the time. Definitely a 10/10, and a true VR masterpiece that was essentially my introduction to the Oculus Rift.","Aug 23, 2017 at 2:00 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 11:05:22.860300,EmpathyKing,VR with 90s flair...,"I bought the Oculus DK2 just for ***** & giggles. I knew though that with time, more research and a little imagination that VR could only improve. As soon as I put on the DK2 and found myself in a black room of endless nothingness standing in front of a low res office desk I knew that VR held the future of gaming... Heck, the whole entertainment industry can and will benefit from VR. Being able to stand in that empty black space and look at that desk just as I would look at the desk my gaming rig sets on simply blew my mind. The possibilities that ran through my mind at that very moment were endless and if these thoughts were going through my mind they surely were going through the minds of gaming developers... Weren't they? Now that semi-practical VR (it's still expensive) is finally here and I've got the real deal, I'm waiting for all of those ""possibilities"" to become a reality. It seems that I am going to be waiting for a long time unfortunately. Because of the price point, many gamers can't afford to hit the VR scene, which leaves many devs scared to spend the kind of cash that is needed to make a AAA blockbuster VR game. This unfortunately leaves all of us having to sift through a lot of crap just to simply find a VR game with half of the sparkle that a AAA game has. Every now and then though you do find diamond in the rough, but even those games are good, they tend to be really short with little or no replay value. RoboRecall is really good. The graphics are on point and the audio backs it up. The ability to kill robots in various different ways is a huge plus and keeps the game fresh. The only thing that kills it for me is the lackluster plot mixed with (IMO) a little to much 90's rail shooter flair. The plot is a huge deal for me and if the storyline were there I would definately rate it at 5 stars!","Aug 13, 2017 at 10:39 PM",3, 2,

The only reason I stopped playing was because I punched my fist into a robot in virtual reality but into a stone fireplace in regular reality. True story. The only thing I'd like to see improved is (more) sound attenuation and HRTF on key sounds. I often think there's something behind me or on the side of me, but nothing's there, and vice versa.

2022-05-28 11:05:26.015001,supernugy,The BEST,"This game is just amazing! Hands down the best VR game on Oculus. 

The gunplay is polished to a mirror shine and visuals are stunning. Fights are fast and require quick thinking. Amount of different kills you can perform on your enemies is amazing. Long range headshots, close range shotgun blasts, grab a robot and rip his head/arm/leg off or use it as a shield. It has it all. While the objectives are mostly to just kill or defend (occasionaly some boss) there is just great variety of ways HOW to approach these objectives. 

A minor gripe I have with this game is a variety of available weapons. You get only 4 different weapons. It could use a bit more. However the weapons you do get are nice and customizable.

Story while a bit silly it's a good king of silly. It doesn't try to take it self too seriously. And the quite comedic naration adds to the fun factor. 

And thats the main word I would use to describe this game. FUN. Go ahead and grab it if you can. You won't be sorry.","Aug 23, 2017 at 2:03 AM",5, 1,

I hope they add more levels or something because while I can replay levels to try and get more stars to upgrade the weapons I have hit a wall where I can't seem to do better at the score.

It absolutely is as much fun as it looks. Its hands down the most fun I've had on Rift so far. I keep dabbling in other games, but I keep coming back to Robo Recall.

The graphics are brilliant (the reflections are so cool). I run a GTX1080 and it's as smooth as butter. I've even bumped the Super Sampling up to 1.5 and I've not noticed any frame drops.

This is the kind of fun action I want from my Rift. I'm all for a good story experience, but sometimes all you want is to dive straight in and shoot akimbo pistols and tear robots limb from limb lol.

Now its here and although this is the first iteration (Rift for me), I am not at all disappointed.  Sure it'll take time for things to improve, but, Robo Recall makes my investment worth it.  I've played a few other FPSes but this one takes the cake.  Graphics is top notch.  I like the storyline and the in-game physics work really well.  Teleporting seems to work in this title and doesn't break the immersion.  Once you accept that in Robo Recall's world tech is more advanced that what we're used to today, its easy to embrace even what could be argued as flaws (which I won't go over).  I like the game and I play as often as I can.  Finished it a few times... but its still good.  On top of everything, I like the voice-overs for the characters in play.  Great job guys.

2022-05-28 11:07:18.585837,RoninKnightfall,"Best VR title I've played, hands down","This game is exactly what a VR shooter should be, combat is fast paced and enemies come from every direction, but you never feel out-matched once you master the controls. The fact that all enemies are robots and there's no blood or gore should make parents happy, but doesn't detract from the satisfaction of grabbing them and yanking a limb or head right off should they wander too close. The guns are distinct enough to make them all fun, and experimenting with the different mods you can put on them is also neat. A teleport and bullet time mechanic make you feel downright god-like as you tear through crowds of bots, shooting them, pulling them apart, throwing them into each other, catching their bullets and pitching them back at them, or playing ping-pong with your guns as the paddles. Only wish there were more missions and co-op multiplayer over LAN and the internet. This game feels like being inside an old school arcade shooter like Area 51 or Time Crisis, only much, much better. If you are playing around other people or doing demo's, make sure you go into your device settings and turn on audio mirroring so the audience can hear what's going on (they'll have a limited view of what the headset wearer is seeing on the monitor). A final note: if you have 3 + sensors it's even better, you don't get the annoying ""face front"" message popping up if you end up turned around.","May 28, 2017 at 10:51 AM",5, 3,

Sometimes it will spin me 180 so i'm facing away from the sensor, losing my signal, so then i have to re-position myself so that i'm facing the back of it.. Other than the occasional pain, it's good overall. I just wish the Oculus wasn't so tempermental when it comes to 180 playing, if you're not facing the front, it starts to panic and flip out..

2022-05-28 11:08:25.996734,GibStorm,Hampered a bit by teleportation only,"Really like the game, but the teleportation totally ruins the experience for me. Why do developers insist on only making games for people who get sick from VR? Especially for this great a game, it is a real shame. PLEASE make some movement options. I'd prefer a free movement scheme of course. UPDATE: New patch allows for you to still use the teleportation directional arrow while 360, which is awesome. Upped my rating to 4 out of 5 stars. Things I'd like for the game to be perfect (besides free locomotion of course): 1. Add back the arrow on the floor circle showing me what is towards the front of my play area. I have a fairly narrow play area, so despite having 4 sensors I still want to be facing forward as much as possible, to avoid hitting a closet behind me. 2. Allow us to disable the scoreboard on the monitor entirely. This is useful for streaming on Twitch for example. In such a situation, I feel the scoreboard is in the way. Would be much better to dedicate the full window to actual gameplay.","Apr 7, 2017 at 7:55 AM",4, 3,

I want to smack anyone who lowers stars because of locomotion after everything these guys put into this game and how it runs so smooth and looks so freaking amazing. Im running on a r290 graphics card and a 9590 AMD processor and I have had 0 problems. Iam getting the Ryzen 1800x and soon Vega and I cant wait to crank this up.  I dont think it can even get better but Im running the game on default low settings right now and its blowing my mind all over again like when I first tried Oculus VR. 
No 360 roomscale? I for one do not have a 3rd sensor. Also I was really glad to see that message for once telling you your facing away from sensors. I dont want to ruin my cables a second time by having them becoming twisted over time. Maybe they can have it turned off in options for those who dont care.
No locomotion? I was upset for about a minute and then I got used to it and the game is a blast. Besides they can add it later. Right now its the most fluid and amazing looking game thats really fun.

Gameplay - FPS rollercoaster with hilarious action. BEST controls, BEST teleport implementation, BEST mechanics out there.

Sound - awesome.

The only downside - only 9 levels. However, with challenges, it gets far more gameplay packed, as you try to achieve them all. Mod support is awesome, however I would love to get DLCs with more areas and more levels.

And if that wasn't good enough Epic have made the game 100% moddable which means we could end up seeing new content coming to this game regularly for YEARS.

It's easy to play but difficult to master and the humour is excellent throughout. This is $10m well spent by Oculus and yet another awesome free game too.

When you teleport but you are not facing the forward direction the game expect it changes your direction for you. This is madening and leads to poor gaming performance since you have to get your bearing all over again after each teleport. If they fix this soon I will update my review but I find it ridiculous that this is forced on people with no way to turn it off.

If you (somehow) don't own Touch controllers, they are an eligant expression of VR design and this game applies them perfectly.

VR presents a new challenge for expression action-in-motion for tense, tactical, exhilarating moments. Strafing doesn't work in VR -- at least not for now. We need a new paradigm.

This game hits every new VR note so well that it almost stuns you into accepting it as the thing to just copy again and again. 

Hopefully not -- but it is well worth praise and shows that VR is only limited by how far designers can imagine and how well controls can adapt to support new motion.

The graphics, gameplay, controls and mechanics are all top notch. The campaign while short offers a lot of replayablility due to the leveling system in place, the more you kill rewards you with stars which can in turn be used to unlock weapon upgrades. There is also fixed attributes you unlock as you level that will make getting more points and kills easier the higher in level you get. Each of the 9 levels has leaderboards and challenges attached, again adding to the replay value. I got this game for free, but if I had to pay for it, would do so in a heartbeat. Lastly, it supports mods and there is a website via ingame that you can visit to download the mod creator so you can play others mods or create your own (going to test here soon). 

Overall scoring: A+++ 10/10. 

Final Thoughts: Hope they add more to it overtime, maybe another zone and some more weapons but if not, game is still golden. The only complaint I have, is no achievements, again maybe something that can be added.

It is fun to see the variety of ways each indivual can enjoy the game. I personally like ripping the robots heads off but my little brother likes to hold his pistol sidways and rapid fire like a gangster or throw crabs like a football just to see how far they'll go. The only thing I dont like are the stupid arrows telling me to turn around to face the sensors. there is a positioning line on the ground circle that will work just fine for me if I start having issues and need to readjust. Ultimately I see this game as having a lot of future potential as well if paired with an omni directional treadmill and haptic feedback shirt to untether from the standard teleport movement and make it easier to determine where you're getting shot from.

Except you're IN the game this time.  It's light-hearted and doesn't take itself seriously, which just makes it that much more fun.  While your personal skill and aim are absolutely important, there are also unlockable upgrades and a level-up feature that grants permanent buffs the longer you play.  So some of those ""How can that be possible?!"" challenges on the stage become attainable the more you play.  And there are just so many ways to play!  Long-range sniping, close-range shotguns, melee attacks, deflecting bullets with your bare hands.  Or go for total brutality: Grab a bot, rip its head off, yank off a leg, and use the torso as a shield and the leg as a club.

Movement is done via teleportation, which has its pros and cons.  It's comfortable for people prone to motion sickness.  However it's very easy to get turned around, especially if you tend to turn in place in the real world.  It only takes a second or so to reorient yourself, but in a fast-paced game like this, that can be problematic.  Still, with practice, you get used to it.

This is easily the best VR game I've played to date.  It's not gimmicky at all, doesn't get stale after an hour, and really utilizes the VR environment and touch controls to their full potential.","Mar 18, 2017 at 10:20 AM",5, 1,

As a Unity dev, this game really shows off how good the Unreal engine can look. Gotta love those planar reflections.
-
This game does things fellow VR devs should note. The big one is the teleportation system: push up on the stick, then change direction of the stick. Amazingly simple, very fast to get used to, and allows for action-packed first person shooter games. The number of cool interactions you can do, and the combos you can get for them, is great, from grabbing and throwing bullets, to ripping robots apart, to juggling robots in the air with bullets. At any moment I feel my brain is firing a thousand billion neurons as the battlefield changes and I plan, in less than a second, to teleport behind a robot, grab my shotgun, blow his head off, while grabbing a stray bullet with my other hand and tossing it at a nearby drone. I usually don't care for arcadey games like this, but this is just too good. 
-
The other implementation Epic Games gets right is ""distance grabbing"" of objects. As a lazy person, I won't stand up to play a game, and I won't turn my chair, and I certainly won't reach to the ground to grab things. NONE of those are necessary here, and between the telekinesis of grabbing close objects you aim at, and the awesome, aimed teleportation, you can be super lazy and enjoy this.
-
The sense of humor is also great, with robots saying things like ""you are being an unpleasant customer!"" and ""blue screen of death!"" when you ""recall"" them. The guy announcer's voice would usually annoy me to death, but in this game for some reason I love it.

Anyway, if you want an idea of how to use Touch controls WELL, this is a great example. Now to find an example of good first person STEALTH since action is covered.

But the replay value is low to me. I don't mind playing the missions again and again, the shooting is fun, but the non-skipable sequenzes of Odin talking to you are really annoying. I don't want to see them over and over.

The levels are more like small arenas. I wish the would be bigger and more diverse levels. You basically just encounter wave after wave in a small area. While the actual level is in fact small, the places feel big because of VR. But there is not much you can discover.

Also the game lacks free locomotion, a mod fixed this pretty quickly but you can't play it with the leaderboards when mods are active. :(

I really hope there are more levels to come and an update that allows me to skip these sequences. I also would like to be able to skip the countdowns as well.

Bottom line for me is that this is just yet another wave shooter, but a very well done and good looking one. :)","Mar 8, 2017 at 7:39 PM",3, 0,

yes i understand why they did it like this. oculus tracking isnt the best they want to make sure your always standing right in front of the sensors. i understand that... but thats now how it should be. i rather buy a third camera then be limited by the game  because of oculus poor room scale tracking. hopefully a fix comes soon.","Mar 9, 2017 at 3:59 AM",4, 0,

Also, I would have loved to see some multiplayer features mostly like co-op just because well I'm a sucker for it, survival type multiplayer would be interesting and of course just plainy shooting at other people in a deathmatch type or whatever else that can go with it. (Defend a checkpoint in a team deathmatch)
If this is ever done please put on public multiplayer servers as well as building up a friends list as a requirement is simply frustrating.  
I'm sure that all of the demands above are to much to ask for a free game but I would pay a good price for a second of this game with all or at least some of the perks mentionned above. 
Other then that, it a funny story with good gameplay, I've played 2 FPS shooters on VR so far, one of them is Robo Recall and dam it feels real to shoot at stuff on VR with both games wich is very satisfying.
At first if you've never hold a gun in your hand to shoot stuff like me it feels very hard but it actually doesn't take a lot of time to get use to it and be quite good at getting how it works. 
It is feeling more irrelevent in this game to waste ammo but in a game like Arizona Sunshine its important to save on the bullets on harder difficulty settings which means aiming right and in the head for the most times at least.
Anyways , on that note I don't know how anyone can complain after receiving this game for free and certainly more so when it is currently hard to find a game that you can have a lot of fun on VR while your going trought a really funny story. 
Without it being free and depending on the price I would have given it a 3 stars if I would have even bought it in the first place.","Mar 7, 2017 at 2:59 AM",5, 0,

Epic Games has done an amazing job at making the player feel like a bad*** and make it feel good while doing so. The controls are perfect for the VR environment, and I felt no sickness at all when playing. The story mode is tons of fun and has a ton of replayability for you to go back to levels you played before and complete objectives, go for the highscore on the leaderboard, or unlock more customization for your guns. The story mode in this game is incredibly fun and is a breath of fresh air for those that want to play offline as most games only feature multiplayer or have a lackluster story mode that feels like an afterthought.

Robo Recall is unapologetically a first person arcade shooter that channels the spirits of the likes of Namco, AM2 and Sega.


It has all the tropes of those old arcade games and embrasses them fully, but this time doesn't charge you a quid a go (ok, you need all the expensive VR gear, but I'm guessing you already have all that given you're reading this!).


I don't care that it's a wave shooter, and I don't care that it's teleport only - this is an absolute joy to play. It transports me back to those over the top 90's arcade games, complete with a modern VR twist, and I couldn't be happier []-)

2022-05-28 11:10:35.324631,SimonTheo,Fantastic Arcade Action,"A great looking -- and more importantly, great feeling -- game that evokes the best arcade style gameplay of yesteryear. Combat is fast and intense, and weapons, object interaction, menus, everything feels very snappy. In particular I love the ""telekineses"" item pickup -- it feels really good, and pulling apart robots feels great too, with excellent audio, haptic cues, physics, and visual effects.

The locomotion is a push-stick-and-release teleport with arrow pointing to determine your forward direction after the teleport, similar to games like Arizona Sunshine and Call of the Starseed. I really really wish I could rotate in place with a simple left/right on the stick, but they don't support that sadly. I have a front facing setup, and it works ok, but a 360 setup would probably work a lot better as you often get surrounded by enemies.

For me replayability is high as there are challenges on every mission, and I already want to go replay the few missions I did. Of course, I've only played an hour or so so this could change easily. However, the fact the game is open to modding makes me hopeful it has a long tail.

Overall, excellent game that reminds me of strongly of a Sega style shooter, especially with the font and UI design (orange and blue text on white background screams Virtua Fighter to me), and the over-the-top announcer is straight out of Daytona.

However, I hate teleporation locomotion. Please advise the developer to implement free locomotion with stick direction. In terms of gameplay I have to add that front facing is not enough, this needs definitely 360° for lots of robots were behind me and I got constantly shot and lost HP with being aware of it. I think 360° tracking setups should be a general VR standard vor VR high end system.

2022-05-28 11:10:54.761813,Oceansize,"Super-Hot VR +1,000%","Why take the time to read my review when it's free???  Just try it!

If you're still reading, the gameplay is similar to Bullet Train and Super-Hot VR but oh so much better/deeper (and COLOR IS GENERALLY A GOOD THING TO PUT IN A GAME, lol), and the pistol/holster system works exactly the same as Dead and Buried. What's also really cool is when a robot is about to overcome you and now you're able to reach behind your shoulder and whip out a shotgun and blast it in the face. It's an exhilarating combination of shooter and melee with waves getting increasingly intense, and good variety of baddies. The new twist is being able to tear apart your enemies and cudgel others with their body parts. You can also grab bullets and throw them back. How you can throw a bullet back at the velocity necessary to pierce metal is beyond me but hey it's a game.

I don't understand why it's free, the top-shelf production could easily earn this title premium pricing and it's not like Epic needs help getting on the map; they're legends already!  Maybe it's simply to increase sales of Touch, who knows. Regardless, Thank you sincerely to whoever was responsible for that decision!","Mar 2, 2017 at 10:35 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 11:12:06.085981,KrYojeNiX,One of the best VR games available!,"First off, the only reason i haven't given this a 5 star is due to needing more content, would also be nice to see some other enviroments other than city based one's, that being said, all other games i would have to rate at 3 or less stars :P
Hat tipped to Epic for creating such a wonderful game, and really looking forwards to seeing some epic mods, hopefuly in the very near future.
The only game that comes close in regards to shooters would be RawData, but since owning Robo Recall, Raw data has been left on the shelf ;)
If wanting to have the best shooter available, then imo this is it!
Also played this on the HTC vive, and tbh have not had any issues what so ever!

This is the reason I bought VR. No motion sickness what so ever. In Rally, I can find myself in a deep sweat, but 45 mins into a session absolutely no problems. Really fun experience. Really have to be cautious of your surroundings though. chucking stuff in a game is fun, but be wary of the old tv. I cant wait for more to come! pretty much anything built in the unreal engine for VR has been a smash to play. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","Mar 12, 2017 at 1:57 PM",5, 0,
