The second time around I stood up rather than sat down like it suggests and it's colourful rather than red.

Just found a few times the resolution wasn't as crystal clear as I would like, which made it hard to focus but overall happy I saw it (also keep in mind this movie is now over 3 years old).  

By the way, if you are stuck on the 'play' screen you might need an xbox or other pc controller.  That is where you can click one of the buttons to start the movie.  At least that is what worked for me.  I read it online before trying that.","May 23, 2019 at 6:45 AM",4, 4,

=: No Oculus Touch support - had to use Xbox controller to initiate the experience.
-: Interactivity with Henry’s eyes occurred only ONCE as far as I can tell which is unfortunate because Saschka Unseld mentioned ""… a character will suddenly look at you. Henry will do that and he be aware that you are here watching his story unfold”. That statement seemed to imply more than what was experienced here. Regardless the experience was decent even as of Q3 2017.

More info: While “Lost” felt really boring and uninspired it was definitively not the case with “Henry”. Experiencing ""Dear Angelica"" from the same studio is also recommended but watch it before Henry so you can boost your morale after with the little Hedgehog.

2022-05-28 17:16:41.479208,Virtuix_,Lower your expectations.,"When I ordered my Rift, one of the first things I had planned to download was Henry. The video, pictures, and description of this VR experience really raised my expectations, and got me excited. But I was massivly disappionted. It lasts a couple of minutes and there really is no story. You stay just sat inside his house for the entire experience, and all there is to it is just watching some magical balloons dance and bring him a turtle to be friends with. Thats it. 
It is free, but I seriously am doubting whether is was even worth the time of me downloading it.","Feb 19, 2017 at 11:14 PM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 17:16:47.858150,karrtoon,Henry is entertaining.,"It's entertaining, and really gives a look as to what a pixar movie in VR could be like. But would highly recommend using the Oculus debug tool and supersample it higher for better image quality. It's pretty blurry at the default settings. Also I would recommend walking around, and putting a real chair where henry's virtual chair is and sit there, then get up again. It made the experience much more immersive.

I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt there was some untapped potential with interaction and the story there.","Nov 14, 2016 at 9:08 AM",4, 10,
