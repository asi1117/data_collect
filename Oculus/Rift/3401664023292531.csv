2022-05-28 20:18:26.600150,DoctorQuin,My mom said I should take a break,"Honestly, this game is one of the best VR games I have ever played! You really feel like a new 007! The story definitely matches the type of game the developer wanted to have. I can't see any reasons to not buy the game, even the music is very well done. Just make sure you start with the first part of the series. 
The game is worth the price, so I expect you to buy!",Jan 8 at 9:19 PM,5, 20,
2022-05-28 20:18:26.615111,rocking2cool,fun game,I love this game so much but on the 4th level I looked up a tutorial on it and it says to disable barrels 3 and 4 and the axe will go back up into the thing and the secret door will open. But it never opened and the axe never went back up.,Mar 26 at 2:45 PM,4, 0,"Greetings, Agent!

2022-05-28 20:18:26.660988,Talitaluana,Absolutly amazing,No words just amazement. I adore these games so much and have huge admiration for the creators. Amazing job!!!,Jan 4 at 6:33 AM,5, 10,

2022-05-28 20:18:29.782282,quizheader,I expect you to play,"This game and the series has set a new level in VR gaming.
The controls, the voice act and the amazing music, everything in this game is just top notch.
Best VR game of the year for me.
To be continued in part 3...",Dec 3 at 3:09 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:18:29.797242,Gamertag_VR,SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST VR GAMES,"Absolutley love this series and from what Ive played so far its more of everything the original fans loved and extra

The intro feels triple AAA and is goos enough for a bond movie! check out Mission 1 and 2 by searching ' I expect you to die Gamertag VR' The livestream for mission 3 & 4 is happening right now too",Aug 25 at 1:51 AM,5, 66,
2022-05-28 20:18:29.812202,scribblez02,AMAZING,The first part to this game was amazing and I was sad it ended so quickly but part 2 is more amazing than I ever thought it would be.,Dec 12 at 9:52 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:18:29.827162,DaylightXP,One Of The Best Games Of Oculus,"After buying the first I Expect You To Die, I quickly purchased this one and expected it to be like to first one. Nope! This one is better, with a lot more characters. I completed it in the first 3 days too. Absolutely recommended.",Oct 16 at 5:05 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:18:32.925023,witty_username_here,Absolutely brilliant,"The game is amazing. The story is much better than the original and is fun to follow. The mechanics are simple but implanted very well and the voice acting is nice. Big surprise hear will Wheaton. The puzzles are perfect as in they are hard but when you sit, think and play around you can solve it. In the event you die getting back to the point you where at is easy and prevents you getting to bird and leaving. 

The only bug I have found was the occasional item falling through the ground which is a small problem but doesn’t effect gameplay at all",Aug 28 at 8:12 PM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:18:32.940980,ObiWanKenobi123,An excellent sequal to an excellent game,"I enjoyed the levels in this game more than the first and i loved the story as well, i loved the intro as well which i also like more than the first i would 100% reccomend this, i think it could have had a couple more levels in the middle or have been a little cheaper, or maybe an extra level for getting all the extra stuff but other than that amazing, 5 stars cause i cant rate it 4 and a half!",Sep 28 at 1:02 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:18:32.955940,Doommakerguy,I'm addicted to this series,"It's criminal how long it took for this game to come out, but alas, good things come to those who wait. In this case, a perfect puzzle experience came to me who has waited. This game perfectly ties in with the first game yet still leaves room for the inevitable future installment. The guide is as charismatic as ever and the villains have stepped up their game since the first installment. 

My only issue with the game is the length of the main story. I plowed through it in a couple sittings. The length of the game however is redeemed with the secret souvenirs as well as the Speedrun watches (which is insane fun by the way).

This is a seated vr game which is perfect for this genre as well as for beginners. 

Don't skip the intro music video, it's a banger. 

I recommend this game AFTER playing the first game however. As of posting this review, there is 1 month free promotion (for quest 2 users using oculus link) going on for Viveport Infinity, which includes the first I expect you to die as well as a plethora of games.",Sep 7 at 11:44 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:18:32.971898,SSlatch,Best VR Puzzle Game,"Absolutely love this series. The setting, style, and charm of this game adds so much to the already unique puzzle experience. Not to mention the great music. It has great replay value to keep you busy til what I hope will be DLC or even part 3. This game is a must try and I highly recommend it to anyone!",Aug 29 at 6:00 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:18:32.987854,XRAY47-,A fantastic sequel to a brilliant series,"I have reviewed i expect you to die one and also gave it 5 starts, these are hands down my favourite vr games that have evr been released, so much effort has gone into creating an interactive play space for the player, you can use a array of differnt tools to complete tasks allowing for you the player to choose your own playstyle and use your own initiative to solve the puzzles.

this games story line is an awsome addition to the first game and leaves a great ending for the next game aswell, i really enjoyed every level, and the puzzles i faced, this games puzzles  have a smimlar feel to the first game but with more mechanics and a sense of urgency making them a step up in my opinion.

overall, fantastic game i would highly reccomend purchasing this game if you enjoy vr but of course play the first one befopre this so it makes sense.

only complaint: not enough cigars",Sep 3 at 7:27 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:18:36.094155,jeremie.lefebvre,Enjoyable sequel,"If you liked the first ""I Expect You to Die"", you will enjoy these six new levels.
I find it a little bit easier than the first one (or maybe I am a better agent.)
That's a short game, you can finish it in 1 or 2 days, but you can prolong the fun with speed runs and trophies to collect.
About the story/universe of the game: a little bit less James Bond, a little more coherent narrative (althougth it's still very much a James Bond parody.)",Sep 18 at 8:58 PM,3, 2,
2022-05-28 20:18:36.108118,Wobblywack,By far one of my favorite vr experiences,"This game hooks you from the beginning with its amazing dialogue, unique gameplay, and intricate puzzles.

The missions are far more dynamic than the first game, so if you liked that one, I would get this one now.

Definitely worth the 24.99",Aug 27 at 5:29 AM,4, 8,
2022-05-28 20:18:36.123078,yousmellikespaghetti,So good,This game is so good plz make a 3rd one with more missions. they should aslo make this game a show/movie,Oct 23 at 1:31 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:18:36.138038,ThornyBlades,"Short, but fun","The game is very short but it is very fun and difficult to figure the puzzles out, i hope that similar to i expect you to die 1 that they will release more levels as free DLC, another masterpiece of spy action from the chads over at Schell",Aug 31 at 6:14 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:18:36.152997,wangcat,Story is facinating,"Worth to buy. Tried their 1st title as well which was outstanding regarding the story line for a VR game. 
This one is also great one to have fun time to time. Graphics is good for story.",Sep 7 at 10:41 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:18:39.232925,e8kor,God quests,"Very good soundtrack, good quests, feels like single person questroom",Sep 6 at 5:28 AM,5, 1,
