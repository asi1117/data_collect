Looks bad with no textures, however it is immersive. Black and white is a nice touch.

Movement is smooth with snap turning. I don't think you can change it anywhere. 

Not much to do. Look around thy house and touch some items that have interactions. Pickup the rifle to play a short very rubbish wave shooter without waves, just endless. Then the best part. Go down the cellar to watch some documentaries on the movie. 

Let's face the truth here the movie was a classic great that spawned many zombie movies there after. So the cellar is paying respect for the movie and is one of the best feature of this experience other the one other obvious one that it is free.","Nov 2, 2019 at 9:08 PM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 18:45:17.803488,ActionA,A thrill for a fan of the horror classic,"It's a pretty great experience for someone who is a fan of the original zombie film. It has great ambiance, the environment looks so much like the movie! There are a some fun interactive things to do and fantastic video documentary clips that any Romeo fan will love!  Oh and you can shoot a few zombies, who doesn't like to do that!!??","Nov 30, 2019 at 3:14 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:45:17.818448,doghous3,Homage to the Movie,"It's free.  Can't really complain too much about that.

But, I guess the question is - is it worth your time?

Maybe for die-hard fans of the movie, which in that case, the cellar is where you'll find the best content.

Looking for a scare?  You're not going to find it here.  A missed opportunity considering the setting.","Nov 3, 2019 at 5:50 PM",3, 7,
