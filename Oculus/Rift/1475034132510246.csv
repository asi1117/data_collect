2022-05-28 16:17:53.686278,gorden.foster.7,I like this but...,"this is a good simulator from what I can tell, however since day 1 i keep getting a warning regarding loading threw VR ( which I cannot find any way to alter or remove the warning) as well now a big red warning about my software being outdated and  new update that does not seem to be pushed out from occulus. I cannot update the software and even fully uninstalled and manually removed all traces of software and it still installs an outdated version, I hope it will be updated soon as this is disapointing for the cost of the software","May 2, 2021 at 11:34 PM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 16:17:53.700241,zkosn,One of my Zen go-to's,"Update: Ver26 movement controls are fixed.  Finally can use the sticks to fly around, FPS style.   Note, I got stuck in the tutorial, unable to proceed.  Menus are improved.    While I still don't think I could create a ""good"" new scenario in VR, at least using the built-in ones are entertaining.","Nov 24, 2020 at 6:33 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:17:53.715201,blueperfluous,,"Visually stunning with massive, God-like controls. I don't think the controls are bad, just difficult to master. An extensive in game tutorial would solve this. The X or A button opens the main menu to choose from an exciting array of planetary or galatic playgrounds. Once in a play area, the joystick has 4 cross-hair points that you have to click in/down on to utilize the rest of the menu options. I suggest you avoid overusing the triggers until you learn to manipulate the menu choices. 

Playing this game is like learning to play a guitar. When you first pick it up, it is very easy to make loud chaotic noise. With experience, you can make subtle and beautiful music. The level of control and interaction you have to manipulate, create, and move through cosmic events and star systems in this game is VAST, perhaps too vast for those without a little patience and restraint.","Sep 5, 2020 at 6:53 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 16:17:56.870761,UnknownSpiral,Controls don't even function whatsoever,Glad I only paid $3 beyond pre-existing store credit because this thing doesn't even remotely work,"May 21, 2018 at 12:44 PM",1, 17,
2022-05-28 16:17:56.886718,rferko,"Perfect for VR, needs better controls.","As an astrophysics major in college (4th year) and a vr enthusiast, I felt compelled to write a review. I love Universe Sandbox 2 but the controls are bad. For instance, the controls for gripping to move the universe aren't responsive and feel unintuitive. Also, there are too many nested menus. These menus should be further divided and assigned to different positions on the thumbstick. It just feels like a lot of the touch controllers functionallity is missing or hidden within other menus. Also, when looking at objects that are very close to your face, you get double labels. Love the game, please fix the wonky controls.","Dec 13, 2017 at 12:30 AM",4, 46,
2022-05-28 16:17:56.900681,FastLawyer,Free existential crisis!,"This game is so good. I originally bought this on the steam store in 2D and now it's free and even better on Oculus VR. You are God, the universe your sandbox. Then you realize how vast and lonely space is. You think how small you are outside of the game. You realize your own meaninglesss existence.

Rating 8/10 would have an existential crisis again.","Dec 8, 2017 at 2:56 AM",5, 80,
2022-05-28 16:17:56.916638,Duncan_Disorderly,Suprisingly disappointed,"As much as I hate to say it, this is disappointing. My confidence in this came from using the previous non-VR versions. There is no sense of location and moving around has no fluidity whatsoever. Yes, you can spawn different objects, like suns, black holes, planets, etc. But, since I haven't been able to pan the cam back for a solar system view, it's a bit awkward to place them. The tutorial is very basic and doesn't provide enough information and most of its features aren't even mentioned. For example; some thumbstick menu options differ from left to right hand. At least, I think that's the case. Even after an hour, I was unsure of how to use all the features properly. With that in mind, it's safe to say it's far from intuitive to use. Sorry. Two stars is the best I can offer. Wish I could offer more. 

Another review said he got it for free. Not me, it cost £15.99!","Dec 11, 2017 at 9:36 AM",2, 17,
