2022-05-28 15:30:31.407791,Elise111R,Favorite VR game but takes time to learn,"I absolutely love this game, but it does take a few hours to learn.  After you get used to the controls, there's an enormous amount of content.  There are 22 different drop zones with 16 objectives in each zone and a bunch of different suits with different speed, lift, and handling attributes.  Choosing the right suit for each objective and figuring out the right line to take add complexity.  Some notes for people starting out - 
1.  Reset your position (button Y on the Rift Touch, I think) when you start.  I like to stand with my head slightly down before each run.  If you bump the reset button the suit will fly horribly because the neutral position of off.
2.  Be somewhat slow to pull up after starting a flight.  As your speed builds, you'll have more lift.  If you get the first two points right, that should prevent a lot of the novice crashes right from the start.
3.  Pick the right suit for the objective!  I love the suit that has 3 speed and something like 7 / 8 lift and handling for beginners.  The 6/6/6 and 10/10/10 suits are my other go-to suits depending on the objective.

There are lots of other tips, but to conclude the review I'll say that I was very frustrated with the game initially, but after putting in hundreds of hours I still haven't come close to completing all of the objectives!  It just takes time and patience to get past the initial few hours.  Please don't be turned off by the comments about a bad controls!  After a few hours the Oculus Touch controls are incredibly intuitive.  When my friends and family play almost all of the difficulty with the controls was fixed by resetting the neutral position (see point 1 above).","May 22, 2021 at 7:41 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:30:31.422750,soustecky,My favorite game,"This is my favorite and most played game after 2 years of VR. The learning curve is very difficult. You need to make sure you’re in the sweet spot of your sensors. The controls are excellent. There is no skill cap, there are always more extreme things to do. 

The only negative is that now it’s not intense enough for me. There should be a speed adjustment. I want to go much much faster because it doesn’t feel realistic anymore.","Mar 14, 2020 at 6:58 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:30:31.437710,Indokast,great so far but room for improvement!,"I really hope the developers read this.  I used to skydive, 208 jumps.  I never flew a wingsuit but always wanted to.  It was just too expensive for a good custom suit.  I ended up playing a BASE jumping game on computer years ago and it was fun and reminds me a lot of this VR game.   I was frustrated at first but eventually got the hang of the controls enough to have fun and now I love this VR game.  However as a skydiver and having played that other pc BASE game I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE for a few things to be added to this game.  One is seeing your arms move in game with the controller.  The BIG ONE though is the parachute.  In the BASE game you can fly the parachute and it responds just like real life skydiving and it was amazing.  In this game there is no parachuting.  You can deploy a parachute and that’s it.  At this point the avatar just goes straight down to the ground and falls over.  If they could get it like the BASE game where you actually FLY the parachute and land on your feet I would like this game twice as much and I'd be happy to pay again or pay more for that experience.  PLEASE BUILD ON THIS GAME!  You have a winner in need of improvement.  Flying the parachute is half the fun and it would be nice to see you arms respond to the controllers.  PLEASE! PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN!  Thank you!","Jan 26, 2020 at 10:54 AM",4, 29,
2022-05-28 15:30:31.451673,Candoe,A Great Game!,"Contrary to some of the reviews below, I think the controls are perfect.    I have enjoyed many hours of play, gradually getting better, and figuring out how to achieve the highest score.   I was able to fly with degree of control after a few attempts, and love the rush.  It is like controlling the path of your own rollercoaster.  However, the controls are somewhat intuitive, and many of my friends haven't been able to make them work...I am glad I have the skill!","May 14, 2019 at 9:47 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:30:31.466633,TheDemonEmperor,This is really an annoying game,"well to start off, when I jump and try to use the motion controls at times it doesn't even respond at all it just makes me free fall to a death (thanks for that) I did like the idea of the game, but it really needs A LOT of work before I'd besatisfied with My purchase...(not even 1 hour and I'm displeased) :/","Nov 20, 2018 at 5:58 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 15:30:34.597260,znixian,Needs much more polish,"As per the title, this game needs quite a lot more polish to be enjoyable. The controls in particular are not exactly good at the time of writing.

And for the developer: I understand how much work goes into making a game. I would strongly suggest you work on a couple of things before adding more features:

- Basically copy Rush's input system - moving your head is very uncomfortable
- Remove or dramatically change the death messages. They currently are rather unprofessional.
- Make it clear which direction is 'forwards', or (preferrably) base this off the head rotation. At present it seems that you can rotate your head, and you're then flying sideways.","Sep 19, 2018 at 6:21 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:30:34.612219,I-M_BlackShaddow,Fly like a flying thing,"The trick with flying is to throw yourself at the ground and Miss !!!

I like it   A LOT !!!  

I've Paracended and Fly, This is some thing else.

I can get Feedback from this that helps me understand what people mean when they talk about motion sickness.

For me the Chute dosn't seem to always open when I Grip/Release.
There are a few Bloody shallow Holes with virtual bodies dotting the virtual Rockies.

Recommend Highly","Sep 15, 2018 at 12:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:34.627179,VividVegasVisuals,Very difficult to control,"Assuming Devs were going for realism, maybe this is a spot on title. But as an avid gamer who just wants to fly for the 'thrill' it's just impossible. It seems turning or adjusting elevation takes entire body contorsions to get a reaction in game, then 1 second later I'm unable to correct any turn before crashing into the mountian. That aside the graphics aren't good enough to count the game as immersive.","Jul 22, 2018 at 3:10 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 15:30:34.646129,rooitou,Love it (has gamepad support),"Wow, this is an incredible game! The sensation of flight is amazing and the flight dynamics are very believable. I love the force feedback on the gamepad and the controls are just perfect. I'm so glad the developer didn't follow the sheep with Touch control only, as not all of us have them or like them. It also works perfectly in Windows 7, a double thanks to developer! 

This is the perfect substitute to donning a real wingsuit; the sights, sounds and sensation of speed are all there. The only thing missing is the windchill. There is a multitude of challenges, slopes and wingsuits, giving excellent replay value. Plus I got it on sale, very happy with the purchase.","May 23, 2018 at 10:51 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:30:34.663083,ajaswinski,"GREAT PHYSICS, LUKEWARM CONTROL","Perhaps I haven't yet grasped the ""sweet spot"", but devs seem to make it too difficult a learning curve to understand. Was hoping for a tutorial as opposed to a ""brochure"" of control steps, as it really is  too involved. Also, the smarmy lines they throw out at you like ""killed by death"" are  very skate-ratty and junvenile. That said, it's very fun when it all comes together","May 27, 2018 at 10:15 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:37.768777,getwithit,i play it daily,"you can only do a handful of jumps before your arms are ready to fall off......tons of content though, should keep me busy for months. on the negative side controls go wonky in about 1 of 5 jumps, but a recenter before the next jump alwas fixes it.","May 25, 2018 at 4:17 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:37.783737,Woody3D,Truly Cool! Clever Use of Motion Control,"The flying is great of course,..  but the best part, are the Multi Camera REPLAYS!  LOL You do something dumb or extreme while flying, (WAY UP INTO SKY Then Straight down spinning 360,  LOL) you kinda forget in the moment, then you see it replayed and you are laughing your butt off!  You can Pause (look around) Fast Forward (using Triggers) and change to many different cameras during Replay (using Grips)  I like to fast forward then PAUSE 1 millisencend before crash LOL","Apr 9, 2018 at 5:36 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:30:37.828617,DButcha,Super Saiyan 9000,"I've always wanted to ""fly"", but never wanted to devote hours to parachuting and wingsuiting so I don't kill myself on accident. Well, this is the next best thing! If you have any concept of wingsuiting and the physics of it, the controls are actually very good. You can steer with your whole body, or really use your arms/hands to make minor adjustments and dodge things. Definitely start with just leaning forwards and backwards, with a little arm tilting to get the feel of turning (pretend you are in the wingsuit! what would you do to turn?!). PS: theres no point in yaw-ing unless you are super saiyan goku, ignore yaw.","Mar 14, 2018 at 5:03 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:30:40.957249,Rodec,I Love this game!,"Great experience!  I have Volo Airsport and I like this one much more.  So much to do, with the challenges and all.  Great smooth progression.  Scary but smooth and comfortable (for me).  I guess if you don’t like heights, don’t like speed or don’t have your VR-legs, then maybe this isn’t for you, but otherwise I give this two thumbs up!","Feb 25, 2018 at 4:13 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 15:30:40.987169,Falcon_DS_,Astounding,"This experience is incredible; the control and feel is just right.  I've never donned a wingsuit before but this is pretty much exactly as I've always imagined it would feel, which is good enough for me...  My arms get tired well before I get tired of the game so sessions are pretty short, which is just as well because you need really good VR legs!","Dec 18, 2017 at 2:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:30:41.002129,festa030,Really Fun!!,Takes a couple runs to get used to the controls but once you do it is very fun and the challenges keep the game entertaining,"Dec 23, 2017 at 3:03 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:44.097849,Cubey,Needs much more refinement,"PRO:
Action packed.
Lots of blood.
It makes use of Touch controllers.

CON:
Sloppy user interface.
Difficult to control flight with Touch.
Graphics could be much, much better.
Limited gameplay.

I hope they produce an update to this one with a better UI, controls, and overall experience. As it is, it's very rough around the edges, like it was rushed out the door.","Jul 15, 2017 at 2:48 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 15:30:44.112809,JesusFreke,"Intense, Fun, Challenging","This is one of my favorite VR games. It is incredibly immersing, and while the flight controls do have a learning curve, once you have a few hours of flying under your belt, you really start to feel comfortable with them.

Pro-tip: disable ""comfort mode"" if you really want a thrill :)","Jul 21, 2017 at 1:38 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:30:44.127769,user045,Queezy,Mediocre graphics. Nice idea. Strong motion sickness for those not used to VR. Flying through the air difficult to work out how to do properly with touch controllers.,"Jun 27, 2017 at 5:11 AM",2, 2,

Worth the two hours of practice to really master the controls (like in the real life ?! )
I wish that the developpers will make regular updates to enhance the physics, relief dynamic wind, adding fog, etc.

2022-05-28 15:30:50.404980,JHarshbarger,Unexpected polish and detail,"This game has a lot more polish and detail than I expected. Picked it up on sale and didn't expect much, but it really came through. It was difficult at first to figure out the controls with Touch, but if you put your arms out and move like you would in a wingsuit, it works great. Only just getting into it, but I can already tell that there is a lot of depth to the game. Each area is really well made with many details and secrets to uncover. Bravo!","Dec 27, 2016 at 1:09 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:30:50.419940,kamiklase,Strange game,"So you try it a few times and after some bloody crashes you manage to finish the route and get points. Then you finish the second route from the same droppoint. And then .... nothing happens. Youre not able  to switch to another droppoint or try another route, you just keep stuck to the initial droppoint. 
I have a GTX1070 videocard, but when I switch to higher video settings, the controls becomen slugish. I only can 'fly' well on lower video settings.","Nov 14, 2016 at 12:03 AM",1, 18,

Once you look past the OK-Ish graphics, you'll realize that the flight dynamics in this game are both realistic and fun. Challenge yourself to unlock new drop points, and watch your skills increase as your XP raises, a true to life measurement of your abilities in the game. Great for XP grinders and casual flyers alike, there is always something new to do in the game, be it trying for a new challenge or just shooting for a high-score, you'll enjoy every second of ground-hugging high speed adrenaline.

2022-05-28 15:30:53.575500,Wrek86,I found this game very enjoyable,"I noticed one review says they did the two circle and got nothing, no new jump spot, ""nothing"" so I thought I woulet everyone know that you need to get a certain amount of points from completeing objectives on the board to the left before you jump to unlock other jump spots. Just doing the two rings even getting perfect on them is still not enough to open the next jump. To see how many more points you need to unlock the next jump spot look to your right before you jump and it will tell you. Also you can select objectives to be highlighted before jumping. I warn anyone that has issues with VR sickness that this can be very rough until you get your ""VR legs"". I agree that the graphics are kind of poor. The game objectives for each jump spot feels a bit like objectives in old snowboarding and/or skate boarding games. You stay on the same mountain, but get different spots to jump from, so the same environment can be a little annoying, but this can be a challenging and fun game if you give it a chance. The ring challenges can be frustrating, but I love a good challenge. Unfortunately they don't really change the challenges for each jump spot, but despite that I still have played this game for several hours and still haven't gotten all the objectives complete or finished all jump spots, so they give you plenty to do and it does have a fun ""sky diving"" feel to it. The other reviews seem to give the impression that this is a ""flight simulation"" game, but it is a ""wingsuit simulation"" game, which is not the same as flying. If you ever wanted to try a wingsuit, but haven't for any reason, this is a fun way to try it out. Even with the some what poor graphics, it was still a lot of fun for me and I continue to have fun with it.","Dec 10, 2016 at 12:30 PM",4, 8,
