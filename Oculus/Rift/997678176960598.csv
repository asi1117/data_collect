2022-05-28 15:44:34.253018,XuJaro,Love It! BUTTTT little kids…,"VRChat is a great game.  You meet so many new people and make so many new friends without even realizing it.  

I personally think it's easier to communicate with people, because I don't have to show people what I look like, but still have a pretty credible experience that it almost feels real. I think if you have social anxiety (like me) it's easy to make your first step in VRChat to learn how to communicate with people. Then you can take a step into the real world, and I notice that I no longer panic so much when I talk to a stranger.  

Talking in VRChat for the first time in public worlds can be a bit scary sometimes.  But I personally think when you play the world “No Time Two Talk” that that changes very quickly. The game works like this: Every 2 minutes you come to a meeting with another person.  In those two minutes, you should try to have fun with that person or ask for personal things. Like where he lives… There is a kind of board in the game where you can indicate your identities and interests and if the other has done that too you can see what your matches are and sometimes that is nice to talk about together.  

Now something about the community. There are people who love the community, but there are also people who completely hate it. My personal opinion is both. I think there are so many nice and funny people to meet. But there are also people to watch out for. Very often you will meet children between the ages of 7 - 13. Often they will say NSFW things or draw those things all around the map.  There are also avatars that are very sexually built, which for me personally is nothing wrong, but for those under age I think it is. I personally think this game is a pure danger to your kid if he is not 13+ yet. Well there are games they can definitely play in this game. Most of the time I even have fun with them. But sometimes it is dangerous who they meet or I which world they enter. I also wouldn't get too used to this game either because it can completely lose yourself in the real world.  

Now a short ending, I think if you are 13+ this game is perfect for you to have fun and meet lots of new friends.",Mar 3 at 6:19 PM,4, 155,

2022-05-28 15:44:34.282938,liv.photophorez,Play at your own risk.,"I went from chilling with some friendly strangers at a delightful little virtual duck pond to being immediately targeted for how my voice sounded, approached and harrassed by a literal SS-uniform clad Nazi spouting the full spectrum of hate speech when I returned to the PUBLIC LOBBY five minutes later. 
This game contains some of the most amazing works of human creativity I have ever seen, but it also contains the absolute worst aspects of humanity on the internet, and they're basically unfiltered since the massive responsibility of moderation is largely placed the user. Exercise extreme caution and restraint, and familiarize yourself intimately with the block button. I HIGHLY discourage parents from letting their children play this unsupervised.",Apr 1 at 3:15 AM,3, 9,
