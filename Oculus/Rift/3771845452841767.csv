2022-05-28 20:10:09.476269,SipheriousFLange,still problemetic,"THey did fix the touch controler issues which made targeting problemetic. The menu system is still a sketchy disaster at best and unintuitive. The whole forced save at camp fire is a pain in the posterior . Te fights are too difficult with certain monsters, I'm looking at you mushroom guys, are way OP. The taunt mechanic is idiotic and makes fights with 5 to 6 monsters that  have  the holy trinity in effect Tank, Healer, Dps  almost a sure loss. Strategy is important but useless if you cant recover mana and health prior to encountering said monsters The lack of places to rest is annoying to say the least did i mention that  already. The developer utilizes  moronic gimicks to make the game feel artificially harder.  I really want to like tha game but there are too many annoyances. IF i could refund the game i would. STAY WELL AWAY   its  a soggy  turd sandwich.","Dec 6, 2020 at 1:56 AM",1, 5,"Hi! Thanks for the detailed, honest review! I will forward it to the developers, so, hopefully, we can do better in the future. We tried to recreate the blobber-RPG feeling in our game, I'm sorry we did not hit the mark in every way you wanted us to. Thank you for trying our game, and sorry for the issues!"
2022-05-28 20:10:09.491229,philklun,hooray! turn based RPGs work in VR,"This a good turn based rpg, with good characters, good english voice acting, classic dungeon crawling and fun puzzle.  After only 10 |I can tell there is plenty of player/skill/tool cusomization to scratch my 'give me choices' itch.  But what gives the most joy is that this game prove that my gaming comfort food [old school jrpg like] works in VR. 

Sadly there are a few UI choices that detract.  While I was able to enjoy this game with a little patience and practice, they could be show-stoppers to some.  I am hoping they will be addressed by the developers.

1.  Teloprtation is probably the right solution for this grid based game, but the choice of movement seem very off.  Make sure to glance at the map at your feet to determine which way the joystick will teleport you or your inner ear might complain.   Developers; please borrow the teleportation of BigScreen or the Oculus home.  

2. I initially complained about the game pad but discovered the touch conroler option in the settings :)","Dec 30, 2020 at 12:15 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:10:09.506190,Valkill100,Excellent after latest update,"Edit: After the latest update I felt the need to change my review score to reflect this. After a few hours of playing I can say that controls are now responsive and the game itself is an actual joy to play. I love the old school esthetics incorporated into this game. If you were on the fence before I suggest giving this game a shot, especially after the update. You won't regret it, especially if you enjoy good old fashioned turn based Rpgs.","Nov 9, 2020 at 11:39 PM",5, 5,

Is it possible that your Xbox controller is in Player 2? There might be a workaround to this problem which is connecting your keyboard and pressing enter on that screen. It should also start the game. If you still experience problems, please contact us at support@zenstudios.com"
