I play stock market sims; I modded out Skyrim to play a pacifist trader; I built a trading empire in X3 even though the autopilot AI kept destroying my freighters... This game, in theory, appeals to that interest in the extreme. The fact that the levels are small (more like self contained puzzles than economic empire building), doesn't detract too much from the interest for me. From what I saw, they were pretty well designed and interesting challenges.  However, it just doesn't feel like it needs to be a VR game. I would have liked to be using touch controls to interact with the world, or at least have some reason to look around a bit. Instead, the play area is a small, flat box. This could have been a really cute mobile game, but instead, I'm supposed to fire up my VR rig to play it? I don't know, maybe it would appeal to some people, but to me it just doesn't seem like an actual VR game. All that said, I still think it is interesting and worth a couple bucks to give it a try. Particularly because there just aren't many devs making trading games out there, and I want to support them. TLDR; If you are into trading games, try this one out. It may not be the VR experience of the year, but it does provide some nice little economic puzzles, and silly quirky humor.","Aug 24, 2017 at 11:09 AM",4, 3,

Otherwise, fun and cute.","Mar 11, 2017 at 6:13 PM",4, 1,
