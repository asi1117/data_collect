2022-05-28 10:52:58.787119,proficuous_but_in_vr,It's a fun Star Wars game with some flaw,"The story is ok, they introduce this cool ""command your army"" mechanic and then use it once, pushing buttons on the ship is cool but it only lasts for a minute or two, theres no moving in combat, so melee enemies can be taking out by melee, and ranged characters can be taken out by ranged. You wanna stab a stormtrooper? Too bad. You wanna dodge a lightsaber attack and then stab them in the back? Too bad. If the game THINKS a blast hit you, you lose health. Sometimes melee weapons just, phase through the lightsaber, or debris/lightsaber throws don't do anything after making direct and clear contact. Other than those bugs the game's lightsabers, action, dojo, and force mechanics are pretty good.",Apr 13 at 7:36 AM,3, 6,
2022-05-28 10:52:58.939711,SeanOCR,Boring...so unbeliveaily boring,"Let's be clear. THIS IS NOT A GAME!  This is a 3D movie with “gameplay” sprinkled in. I use gameplay lightly because there are no consequences and your actions are pretty much meaningless. It’s supposed to be thrilling, but I’m not sure how that’s possible when during a rancor chase sequence you can literally just walk away and grab coffee without pausing and be right where you left off.  The entire time I’m just waiting for the cutscenes to stop and the game to start…and it never does.

It’s like those rides at universal studios where you are just watching a movie screen in auditorium seats that shake.  If you find those things exciting then maybe you’ll like this, but if you're like me and find those kinds of rides beyond boring then you’ll be bored here too.

I spent $9 on the 3 episode package and somehow I still manage to feel ripped off.",May 1 at 4:44 AM,3, 2,

I am a Massive Gamer and got VR a few years ago, have played many wonderful Games, I got Vader EP 01 a few months back and it was Good, just got EP2 and 3 (not played 3 as of writing this) Yes they are short, but the graphics, immersion and game play is great, EP2 brings you the force and lightsaber throwing WOW just WOW, really shows what VR can do, Excellent game, yes for what it is the price is a little steep but its a Must play game if you like Star Wars and VR.",Jan 22 at 3:42 AM,5, 9,

The biggest gripe I have for all three episodes is the pricing, especially the third part - 8€ for about 30 minutes of story is not ok in my opinion - the whole package (all three episodes) should be 10€ or so. I really hope this is not the direction VR games are going... terrible.

2022-05-28 10:53:02.161169,thebudeg,Not really worth it,"I found this game could be somewhat fun simply because it was an interesting Star wars experience but compared to many other games I felt that it was extremely lackluster. 
Overall play time for this particular game episode we'll average you about 30 minutes and during that entire time most of it is locked jn set pieces were you're not able to interact with anything and simply have to stand and watch. Being completely honest I think the actual amount of time you get to ""play""  is probably around 15 minutes.

2022-05-28 10:53:02.178123,Jayrod64,Even better than the first.,"Episode 1 established an excellent foundation for this game, while Episode 2 expands upon the game further. The ability to use the force is fun, though I wish there were more object wtih which to use the force on in the latter half of the game. Using the force on enemies becomes an extremely satisfying tactic. Sentinels that once gave you so much trouble in Episode 1 are now made far easier by using the force on them. My only real complaint was that I could skip the credits for some reason. Even it's not allowing the player to skip cutscenes and/or credits until after the first playthrough, it's silly and pointless. Remember that Disney owns Star Wars, and they also work with Square Enix to create the Kingdom Hearts franchise. In almost all KH games, you can skip cutscenes and credits from the very beginning if you so choose. All I ask is that we are at least able to skip the end credits in future episodes. Other than that, the game is still great.","Apr 26, 2021 at 1:30 PM",5, 8,

You will find yourself automatically doing the kung fu stances, smashing droids into walls or each other and deflecting with the sabre when needed, it's very fluid and fun.

However mid-write, I considered that this is an £8 game. For that price you get a second part to a well written, compelling, engaging, and immersive story that is clear a lot of time, effort, and care was put in to. The 5 stars for me comes from that the game feels amazing to play, it's mechanically fantastic, everything feels great and super fun to use and I can't fault anything.

Bad first- it has bugs.  One terrible bug- and this isn't really a spoiler b/c it's the beginning of the game, is that in the very beginning if you don't follow vader ""fast enough"" the door closes and you're literally stuck.  He walks thru the door, and you better be on his heels b/c if you're not, game over.  You have to restart.  No way through the door.  Do you even Beta broh?  The only other con is that the ""force"" isn't very responsive.  There isn't some kind of tutorial- so maybe I was doing it wrong but- it just doesn't pick up or act as you anticipate.  It seems like anything goes.  Just wave your hands around.

The good- the game is absolutely gorgeous. The story is cool and the voice acting is really cool- the game is just stunning and immersive.  The characters and monsters/ robots etc are just amazing.  They look real.  So despite the bad stuff- get the game.  It's still worth it- overall the entire trilogy is one of the best experiences I've had on this- a lot of people mention its shortness but- I'm fine with that.  It's not very expensive- the cost of a movie.  Well worth it.  Also it has a cool training mode.

2022-05-28 10:53:27.472441,mdrejhon,Closed Captions for a deaf developer,"Love this VR but got stuck because I am a deafie. (Will update review after fix)
 
Fantastic game, but one big flaw for me as a deafie -- there is no closed captioning or subtitles.

A very clever way to do it is the way Red Matter does it -- wrist mounted caption screen or subtitle screen.     This is superior to floating subtitles/captions, which are not realistic/nauseating in VR.

Real-world deaf people already use an app called ""Live Transcribe"" on android phones to caption real-life.  So this would just be a VR version of real life.  And there could be a backscroll feature if we miss dialogue, and maybe a ""screenglow"" effect coming from the bottom edge if we aren't lifting our wrists to read captions -- some of us might understand what's going on but only need to glance at captions when we need to. Kind of like a ""pip boy"" but Star Wars style.

Hello! Deaf gamer here. I need subtitles. Please?

The best subtitle systems are the ""Republque VR""-style gentle floats, or the ""Red Matter""-style wrist mounted pipboy equivalent.

I wasted money on this game because I didn't know it did not have subtitles.  The Oculus Store does not inform whether a game has subtitles or not.

Oculus Store gets docked a star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does. I heard through a friend that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.

(P.S. I run a website called Blur Busters / Test UFO, and I am a software developer, so I am technically literate as a deafie)

There are solutions that keeps captions/subtitles without breaking immersion -- for some of us. Can you add optional wrist-mount closed captioning, pretty please, ILM?","Feb 2, 2020 at 6:36 AM",1, 55,

2022-05-28 10:53:30.621624,K4tniss,Lacking in a lot of ways,"I 99%ed episode 1 before playing this one - I wanted to get good at the lightsaber fighting before I continued, because I wanted an epic experience. Episode 1 felt a little short and low budget, but I was incredibly excited to see what they improved when they weren't rushing the first episode out the door.

Lightsaber duels in episode one, both in the dojo and story, were engaging and skillful. In this episode lightsabers are nearly unsuable. Enemy blades go through yours, and it endlessly reminds me I must hold my lightsaber ""still and vertical to block"" where ep 1 encouraged parrying & counter attacking. Here it seems less about physically blocking the enemy blade and more about whether the game thinks you're holding your lightsaber in some predefined ""blocking"" position.

The force ability doesn't feel great - in order to do anything, you have to grab things, pull them toward you, and then fling them away. Something a foot from your face, you still have to pull toward you, even after it's floating. If you don't pull toward you, it just floats in place. In the dojo the force is a magic kill button that destroys 2+ enemies per fling and it's so much more useful than actually dueling your opponents that I wonder why you ever would. especially when combat is so broken.

Even throwing your lightsaber, something I dreamed about in the previous lightsaber dojo, is just annoying - it happens anytime you brush the grip button. If you throw it far enough away at an upward angle, there is some drop over time, so I had like 5 minutes of fun throwing it against the far wall. You can dribble your lightsaber like a basketball.

On top of gameplay, the story is *maybe* 20 minutes long, and has nowhere near the variety or engaging environments of ep 1. As noted by other reviews, you essentially stand in place for 99% of it. Also, 99% of it is you standing there or waving your hands at things - no door ""puzzles"", tools, or interactions besides throwing rocks.","Jan 19, 2020 at 4:28 PM",1, 5,

The force is actually fun when you get the hang of it and that is what the first game was missing. Also the dojo in this is ALOT better than the first one. Saber can actually cut through enemies with better tracking! 

BUT give us a longer game. We got to such a great part and I knew that it was over. WOW! Give us a star wars game with maybe multiplayer or just longer campaign.

These chapters leave something to be desired.

I'm a diehard Star Wars fan and have been doing my best to keep up with the new canon and this, while we do get confirmation of some myths being true, leaves so much narrative to be desired. I would kill for another game like the Force Unleashed but in VR, or even a choose your own adventure type game.

In each chapter they are short and are purely just interactable movies which.... is disappointing sadly. I was really hoping for more of a game than a giant cinematic for the price I paid.

The only good thing is the Dojo and the feeling of being in a Star Wars movie. The story mode is really kind of a joke. It lasts maybe 20 mins? You have one fight scene with the force and one with force/saber.  Both last about 30  seconds. The rest is listening to people talk and none if it is very entertaining. 

They do not render your body only your hands. So you have these silly looking floating gloves and two sillier looking floating hilts on either side of your body where you can place your saber... since you really don't even use it this episode.  There also lots of bugs and places where you can get stuck or lose vision because your head is in a wall and hard to manuever out.

The requirement that you stand in a blue box the whole game is just pure laziness and makes it feel more like a long cut scene rather than a game.

What did shine was the new force powers, but they boil down to telekenis, and throwing your sword. and technically you use telekenisis to throw the sword, so only one power. the dojo is the best part here, which i felt the first one was about 50 50 enjoyment between the two modes. so while the campaign is silly short then rest of the dojo is skilled based.
all in all i see less content then the first one, and only one added power. one new enemy type or two and the boss battle was a let down. you didnt get to chop off its head or any crazy staff. i dont know if i want a 3rd one if they skimp and make it even less content than this.","Sep 26, 2019 at 5:28 PM",2, 182,

I'm disappointed at the lack of variety in the dojo this time around, especially considering this is episode 2 and it has less that episode 1. Where are the different dojo environments? Give us stormtroopers instead of droids for a change, you made them already in episode 1...

2. Let us move around a little more, at least widen the movement area in the dojo.

3. Saber collision detection is not as good as Episode 1. Sometimes the enemy weapon (especially standing left or right) goes straight through, low swings don't register on the new enemies.

4. Force moves are so so, frequently grabs the wrong enemy if there are 3/4 things near eachother and you have to aim underneath for smaller items. Not having an blast push/pull and more of a ""stop and wait"" really slows the flow.

5. Lightsaber throw is awesome. Would be nice to come back immediately when you pull your hand back instead of going on an roam to the very back of the room while I get beat to death and shot at.

Please let us customize hilt choice and saber color? Should be a simple piece of GUI and a bit of shader code.

I don't mind the linearity, but for me what kills the game are the abundance of those certain spots you have walk and be in for the 'cut-scenes'. I want to feel free even in tighlty scripted stories in VR. Just let me walk around in scripted scenes, it feels so stupid to just sit around waiting after I've walked into those blue hexagons, which there werre MANY, way too restrictive.

Also to me it seems weird and not coming to me naturally to just press if I want to extend my lightsaber, it should be a held button as it is in the lore, not 'press once to extend, press once to withdraw'. Episode one had so much more other good things that it didn't feel as much of a problem, but in this one it certainly did bother me.

Visuals are very pleasing as were in the episode one, but this one with the same price tag seemed very short, and the game mechanichs for me at least weren't pleasing at all.

Looked at as traditional game, it would be too short, too often block your free movement, just has no challenge at all in story mode (light saber dojo mode has challenge and is more like a traditional game mode).
But after playing the episodes some, it became clear to me that this is not intended to be a game in the traditional sense at all. This is intended to be a fan fantasy fullfillment theme park experience, and as that, it is pretty great, if not excellent.
Graphics and Audio are in a class of their own, very few VR and non VR games and movies come close to this production quality level.
The story and duration is short for usual game standards, but not too short at all when looked at as cinema movie or theme park film.
Basically it is one cinematic moment after the other, never longer than 3-5 minutes doing the same thing. Like as if they made a checklist of what type of Star Wars big cinematic moments could we all have in there, and then they added them all and put one after the other every few minutes. There is a story, with some a bit cheesy worn out moments, some great moments, but to me since i could not stray far from the path nor have branching story choices and the scenery and tasks change constantly, it felt more like the story is there to have a reason to move you from one great Star Wars set piece to another than a world and story one explores freely.
So yeah, if you're looking for a game with constant free movement, challenge etc (in the main story mode, too, not ""just"" in lightsaber dojo), then you may be disappointed. If you  want a great Star Wars theme park experience, this is hands down the best thing one can have in that field at home right now and really pretty amazing if one thinks about being able to have a theme park experience on this very high visuals, audio and immersion level at home now.

It doesnt even give you the option to slay the Mustafarian and take the stone to Lord Vader. It doesnt even let you assume control of the stone to destroy Mustafar, gain power and make Vader your apprentice. They think they can just make a half created game and sell it, its just like battlefront II in that regard, that they are not taking fanbase into consideration and just want your money.

I wish that they would make the story longer since we are paying $10 for basically a demo with an arcade mode. Second, is that the force in the dojo is sometimes hard to use. I will try to use the force on one enemy or try to activate a trap and it won't work or it locks onto another enemy. Finally, there are times when the lightsaber got stuck in my hand during the short story and I had to restart the game to get it to work again. If these we changed/fixed, this would be an amazing 5 star game. I am looking forward to episode 3, hopefully it will be longer than 30 min.","Nov 18, 2019 at 4:05 AM",4, 1,

Short of this being much cheaper, I would honestly suggest watching a let's play of it. Hopefully Episode 3 has more meat to it.

While you undoubtably feel the power of vader and it is extremely satisfying the few times you can fight, there is almost no content here. For the story, it only takes ~ 30 minutes MAYBE to complete. I'm not sure if it's intended, but there are often transisions that go completely black before lighting back up and it's very, very bad for immersion. 

The combat feels intuitive enough, until you realize that every interaction is extremely scripted. Things will glow as if you can move them with the force, but early on there is a hidden countdown between force uses which makes it feel unresponsive. The AI is extremely glitchy and linear. The few fights you have are over within seconds. Each story is going to be $10 and it really feels under cooked. This could be incredible, but it feels like they keep chopping up a short story for more and more money each episode.

I thoroughly enjoyed Episode I, so I was pretty disappointed when I read the negative reviews of Episode II.  Fortunately, there were a few positive reviews that were written well enough to convince me to try it anyway (even if only for the Dojo, which I loved in Episode I)
I guess some people just have too high expectations for a nine dollar game.  I thought it was a bargain for what you get.
Even though there's not much action, the scenery, animations, and graphics are just incredible.  I'm a big nerd for the original three Star Wars films (less so with the prequels and sequels) so getting to stand next to Vader in VR is just... WOW!  The lighting is great too... I love that the lightsaber's light reflects off of objects in the world.  The graphics are rich and believable (not like some VR options that look more like mid-90's games.)
If you're a Star Wars nerd and you liked Episode I of this game, you'll probably be just as giddy as I was playing this.  Forget the naysayers... People have come to expect a 10-hour AAA game for $9 and when they don't get it, they give bad reviews.","Oct 21, 2019 at 12:08 AM",5, 2,

That may seem a decent amount of things to do - and it does flex a wide range of VR uses - unfortunately there’s not much of it.

Really the VR aspect of this is negligable other than being able to look around the small on rails sort of environments...and the gameplay was very underwhelming.

However, I had two major movement glitches during my playthrough that required reloads in order to overcome. For a 45min experience, this is difficult to wave away. Additionally, I never had time to explore the environment, as every time you walk forward it throws you into the next narrative sequence.
I understand the need to help newbie VR players through the experience at the contractually mandated narrative pace: Star Wars is not an IP you can neccessarily deliver off-brand. However, I would appreciate an alternate mode where you have more control over the pace: and possibly less restrictive movement? I miss sprinting, especially in the [spoiler] encounter.
Finally, the force powers are pretty awesome, however they still feel a little clunky. I feel it could be a little sharper, and be more dependent on your hand position (have some rotate control). It would not make a significant difference to the gameplay, but it would increase that feeling of power.
This has elements of a great experience, and I am looking forward to seeing the last episode. However, until the shackles are taken off, I am going to return this, as I don't feel like the restrictions are worth going through a second time.
Edit: Tried the Training Room, this was very fun. The force powers are enjoyable to use here. Wish the lightsaber throw was available in the main game! Still not worth it for me until you get more freedom in the main campaign.","Oct 18, 2019 at 3:12 PM",3, 0,

I will most likely buy Episode III, but this time around, the hype is gone as how the story is going to unfold is more or less clear already.

Warning ! A little petty addition, but come on..

It feels much more like a game than the first episode. However, the force controls were a little hard to understand at first, and as soon as I learned them combat became rediculously easy, to the point where the lightsaber is unnecessary. This episode also felt much shorter than the first one. 

Honestly, despite these flaws, this series has so far been one of the best and most immersive cinematic experiences I've ever had in VR. We NEED more games like this! I can only hope they improve for the third episode.","Oct 9, 2019 at 11:23 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 10:54:30.866039,S1MONSAYS,But the dojo in this one is sooo good!,"After having a blast with part one i was excited to see this one in the store so i bought it right away. In part two you'll be left off at the same place the first one ended. And i think thats a nice touch. But. Like many others reviewing this game the story part/experience is rather lacking in variety. The first one had these grand open spaces interesting change of scenery, this one is based in a dark cave underground with very dark scenes. Some of them where just pitch black with voiceover... i dont get why. Also extended periods of blacklevels like this does not look that good on rift s imho.  But, its all about the force in this one, and i get that it had to teach you the ways of the force before part 3 so, in all fairness maybe it had to be more darker this time around.  AND yeah using the force to grab stuff/enemies feels really good, thats a lifelong dream for someone who's into starwars. Interaction with objects and climbing is present but not on the same scale or variety as part one.

But all in all, i would recommend it just for the dojo because the dojo in this one is something else, force grab with one hand, throw lightsaber at enemies and retrieve it with the force. Its like part one but you feel more free, not waiting for the enemies attack, its more about precision in the throwing aspect.","Oct 9, 2019 at 7:06 AM",4, 1,

For 10$ the previous episode had a story that took at least an hour to complete, big, if not quick, fights, and enough star wars widgets and gidgets to make you squeal with excitement!

What do we get for 10$ this time? A lot of Darth Vader being mad, the ability to pick up rocks off the ground (yes, this includes the lightsaber, it's made of metal and a shiny bit on top) and a few forgettable droid fights which (although now feel more impactful with the new procedural slicing system in place) still feel more like a stand in one place and let things attack you first sort of fight rather than a get up close and stab things through sort of fight. It's just not entertaining, especially for the price. And I know the big sell for this episode is the force ability, but if we're being real here, it's SUPER janky. Half the time it picks up something out of view when I have my hand almost directly pointed at the same object, and even after completing the campaign and spending 20-30 minutes in the Dojo I still have no idea what motion brings things closer to me versus throwing them into a wall or (god forbid) another enemy. the selection of objects takes too long for force powers, enemies have a HUGE time span of invulnerability when emerging from cover (I'm talking like, I've tried to pick them up about ten times before they allow me to, which feels extremely agonizing, especially for a player who is just told ""you have promise"". Like, let me grab the bots now or never. Plain and simple.

And the dungeon is so dark, even if I had more time to explore I couldn't! Peering into the dungeons (tomb, library, etc), there are some amazing assets here, but I can't see any of it! I feel like a jedi padawan using his lightsaber as a torch instead of a weapon, trying to feel my way through a murky sith soup.

That is why Mustafar is a barren volcanic planet because the original user failed and wouldve blown up the planet and herself to bring her husband back.

I hope that in the next one they add a force lightening ability. However, in terms of the story line the character is relatively new to the force so the things we can do in the game seem a little advanced compared to the training Vader gives you. The first game gives you a great intro, the second is all about the force, it didn't really add a whole lot to the story. If only we were given choices that put us on different paths! I think this would add replayability of the game. I think a force shield would be nice since that is really the first thing both Jedi and with learn in combat training.

You indeed get the promised Force, and can use it to grab and move stuff from afar. However with very minimal UI, aiming is a bit difficult, because where the game is actually aiming may differ from where you think you are aiming. This takes time to get used to.
Once you get good at using the Force, though, it becomes overpowered. You can easily pick up one enemy and slam it into another, taking two of them out in one hit. This is way more efficient than using a Lightsaber, making the latter more of a defensive weapon. The game also allows you to throw and recall your Lightsaber, as well as activate traps, but all of them feel like jokes compared to the overwhelming power of the Force.
Although the Dojo now has more rounds and throws more types of enemies at you, it doesn't actually provide more variety when all you do is grab, throw, grab, throw. It may get more challenging in later rounds when enemies can resist the Force for a while, but the early rounds are definitely boring.","Oct 3, 2019 at 2:55 PM",5, 0,

If you liked the dojo from the first one, then that's back and that's where it might make up its value to you. If you're here for the story though, then you might feel a bit short-changed.

Like another review here, I suffered the same issue with blocking (or being unable to sometimes) in the dojo that wasn't there in Episode 1.

Just had to come back and update the review to a 2. It really bugged me thinking about it. $10 for 30 minutes (I'm not counting the dojo padding which is just basically more of the same) is just not cutting it with me.

Also, on a Rift CV1 there is some weird phenomenon where dark areas (like the walls in the distance) sort of lag.

He should definitely tower over us and not be shoulder to shoulder with a normal person. This is the easiest thing to have gotten right!

To give my other impressions: it felt a bit pedestrian this time, like we've seen all the tricks in the bag and it's unlikely to be as varied as the first episode again. The story is unfolding with its fairly contrived ancient history of Mustafar told almost entirely as exposition.

Personally would have much preferred a C3P0 or K2SO-type sidekick than the L337 type we got. 

This episode featured quite a bit of walking about in caves. Not much effort goes in to a narrative reason why you'd stand still in one spot and solve everything. Then things happen as a series of Quicktime events, you may generally fail to quite understand what they're getting at with how they imagine you'll move rocks around, but you'll get through the level unharmed regardless.

It's starting to feel like you could watch a few episodes on Youtube to cover the story and if the Dojo is the actual game, then the last episode's Dojo is probably the one to buy. You'd miss out mostly on the walking around in caves and a few jump scares as a set piece happens to the environment that you have no influence over.","Sep 29, 2019 at 7:01 PM",3, 0,

Restarting checkpoint didn't help. What I played of the story was cool, but the controllers kept vibrating because it wanted me to use the Force on nothing in particular (this happened throughout my experience, from the first time you can use the Force). It's also a pretty short story mode, lasting probably 30-40 minutes.

The dojo is a lot of fun though, and with Force powers you can do SO much more than in Episode 1. It's really a treat, and fulfills that childhood fantasy of throwing things at enemies while you block blaster bolts with your saber. Awesome stuff.

I can't see a way to contact the developer directly, but please, fix the bugs in the story mode and this will easily be a 5 star game. There's not much here, but what there is is pretty fun. It just needs to, you know, work properly.","Sep 26, 2019 at 9:24 AM",3, 2,

The scale was amazing, with the start destroyer, the hanger bay etc. Only slight frustration was the way it let you go through walls and you ""left the play area"". 
(I mean, Lone Echo has collision control, so does Red Matter, so really?)
There was also a ton of interacting with stuff, cutting things down, climbing and so I was really looking forward to more of the same. 
Instead it just feels like a rushed walking sim. It still looks great, and yeah, throwing rocks is kinda fun, but it just was no way near as immersive and fun as part 1. The story was also stupidly short. I know its only €10, and it is still just about worth it, but when I think of the likes of Loe Echo, Hellblade or Moss, all of which I paid 30 quid for and gave me HOURS of enjoyment, 10 quid for 20 minutes just stings a little. Hopefully they will one day release a proper full length 20+ hour game, I would happily shell out 40 or 50 quid or so for that.

It should lunge at me and I should, at some point after dying like 20 times, figure out that I need to leap into it's mouth and jab my lightsaber up into it's soft pallete and into it's brain. That's how this SHOULD have ended. Spoiler alert (JK - when you actually play it you'll experience spoiled...) the end they gave us? A pile of rando red shirts come out of somewhere (nowhere) and start shooting the thing? Come on? Who are these guys? Do I care about the Mustafar and these wierdos? I've only met 2 of them and one of them betrayed his whole people. Frankly, I'd as soon cut these jokers down and I'd cut down that grumpy Rancor. At least the Rancor is a big neat critter who's hungry, these squirmy Mustafarians (yah man) I just can't get behind.

If it wasn't for the dojo, I'd be mad. However, if I really think about it if I just  bought the dogo for $10 - I'd be mad. You know what? I'm mad. 

Fix the ending in the next one, I certainly WON'T be buying it w/o reading the reviews first. You're not shearing this sheep again with lazy storytelling.","Sep 28, 2019 at 12:19 PM",2, 0,

Update:
Problem isnt in graphic drivers, but in Windows 10 1903 release... When i returning back to 1809 V2 november release all working fine..... Under 1903 and all UNREAL Engine games sound not working (rift setup, home, games etc)...

Trouble is though, if you are left handed, be ready to spam it. Same with the right hand. Secondly, if you use the light saber with the left hand, more then all of the boss attacks are meant for right handed people the way it moves. And above all, you can't join vader, not even to choose to give him the relic. That is really unfair, you tease to be able to join the dark side. Even get to kill the bug creatures. Yet, you can't kill or force crush the one who gives it to vader. That and way too short. Half the play time, so should be half the price. Or at least delayed until you give me the proper mini game.

Well done for that! however, very very very short. if this was a demo to get people hyped for the main thing, it would do just that. THIS IS THE MAIN GAME. Complete rip off. lacks any real depth. DISSAPOINTED. I read the previous reviews but this was one the reasons I got VR and I had to try it being such a Star Wars fan. This game is an insult to the franchise and VR. MONEY GRABBERS.  This is exactly what is wrong with VR games. Since i have had VR, the lack of quality games puts me off VR and this game has so much potential yet the feeling of ""is that it"" ruined the entire game for me","Nov 9, 2019 at 7:23 PM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 10:55:44.044973,Tohbias,DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS,"i want to start off by saying that yes the game is fine.... thats the best thing that can be said. Honestly just watch the video of this BS on youtube and swing a stick around while watching save the 10 dollars. yes its visually striking but thats it. movement is slow like a baby learning to crawl. why is it slow, the game is like 20min worth of stuff to do so you crawl through it to stretch it out to 45min and 10 dollars for less then an hour . THATS INSANE. stop passing this BS off like its the best game ever just cause its star wars people. also we were promised the second episode would focus on force powerS not force power, a single power. as far as a lightsaber game well beat saber is more of a lightsaber game then this trash. Nothing comes to a conclusion in either of these epidsodes either so it really only is here to make us keep spending 10 dollars on something worth 2. heres an idea STOP MAKING EXPIERENCES AND START MAKING A GAME. this is basicly watching the worst episode of star wars EVER while being able to swing a lightsaber. these type of games are nothing more then a problem VR has to overcome.  this VR episodic BS is tired. just make a game and release it as normal instead of having the ONLY THING ABOUT YOUR GAME IS HYPE FOR THE NEXT. this game is not making star wars better its making vr worse","Nov 1, 2019 at 8:14 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 10:55:44.063922,1stEagleEye1987,Lightsaber throwing is fun but overused,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GuAuAYh-nc
The above link is me playing the Wave 50 dojo.  So fun.  
I agree with a few other reviews stating that episode 2 is shorter than the first but while playing episode 2 I was having just as much fun while Vader taught me how to use the force.  I too wish it was longer but what you get is seamless.  

Pros:
1. Star Wars. . .nuff said
2. New Dojo focusing on force training
3. Throwing bots into bots was never so satisfying

Suggestions:
1. I wish there was a scale in options that you can adjust to determine the velocity of the blaster bolts.  I want to push the limit and make the 'easy' bots a bit more difficult. This would also force you to use your saber throw more wisely.  Watch the link above you'll see that I kill 99% of enemies with saber throw and force abilities.

Cons:
1. When there are multiple enemies close to each other and you want to grab a particular enemy the game kind of guesses which you'll grab (not a huge issue).
2. I do wish it was longer","Oct 21, 2019 at 8:56 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 10:55:47.210659,deco1234111,"NO BLASTERS, MOVEMENT AND WAY TOO SHORT","Lets get one thing right. This really is the best star wars game to date. However the dojo really is the best part. Do note that they have not implemented movement and  it makes absolutely no sense. You stand on one spot and since when was this ever a case for the jedi. If I throw my lightsaber i should be able to doge while i wait for it to come back.
also both EP 1 and 2 have no blasters in the story or dojo which to me does not make it realistic at all. 
for kicks you could have one dojo for lightsabers and one for blasters where you can hide and shoot. I feel like they were stingy on this second installment as the base game needed ground work to start all the drawings dev and so on. while  the second could just build on what they al ready have. Not cool. Only if you are a true fan do i highly recommend this episode since the addition of force powers makes you truly look cool. Sad part is i know there wont be updates. Its a shame!","Oct 9, 2019 at 3:52 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 10:55:47.229608,Puni12345,Way too short - nothing really new,"For 10 bucks this is way too short - yes it´s well done, as the first part was, but the whole episode II is to run from one short stop to another use the force (push pull) a few times and then get to the endfight. This one is nicely orchestrated, but thats all. Felt like a 15 minute demo for a full game. As i´m not into the doyo very much, i´m quite disappointed. Hopefully they will make up for it in Episode III.","Oct 4, 2019 at 5:16 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 10:55:47.247560,AwesomeTime,A Very Good Continuation,"This episode starts right where you left off in episode 1. Story is shorter and there isn't that much combat in this one. There is the addition of the force grab/throw, which is actually much better utilized in the lightsaber dojo than in the story mode. The lightsaber dojo is a lot more fun in this version because of the force powers (throwing your lightsaber is the absolute best) and the new mechanic of using the environment against your enemies. I'm giving it a 4 star because I was hoping for a more substantial story in this one. Hopefully episode 3 is longer and has more combat in it. Regardless, this does a great job at hyping up the next episode.","Sep 26, 2019 at 5:47 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 10:55:47.266509,TerrbearSF,"Clunky force powers, great saber-play","I expected the story campaign to be the same length as the first, but it felt a bit shorter. Considering this game's story is considered canon there is an interesting revelation surrounding a mysterious character further focused on in this episode that I sense will be a clue regarding Star Wars Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.

The force powers are super clunky and half the time non-responsive which is frustrating. I sometimes had to hold my hand longer at the enemy or aim my palms higher to get the force lock on them. People in my stream said it just looked janky and not well balanced.

Once you get a lightsaber the game shines again like Episode 1. If only the force power controls felt more responsive. The dojo is still solid as before and when the force powers actually work when you want them too it feels even better.","Sep 29, 2019 at 9:48 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 10:55:47.286456,Gonzaxpain,Good but too short and simple,"I really liked the first episode and I liked this one too but it didn't surprise me the same way the first did. It's way too short, even more than the first one (around 35') and not much happens. It looks fantastic, controls are good and using the force is very cool but not much more to it, there is less climbing, less interaction and a little less of everything. I was expecting more for a second episode.
Another thing I don't like is the fact that every episode is installed separately, you cannot play both episodes in a row without quitting one episode first and starting the next as if it was another game.
It's also unbelievable that being a Star Wars title there is no support for other languages, not even captions. 
Still  looking forward to Ep. 3 and still dreaming of a real full-length Star Wars game like this; the mechanics are great, it just needs the content.","Sep 26, 2019 at 11:50 PM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 10:55:50.405786,SeeGuy,Fun but flawed,"I like the storyline, so for that the “campaign” is enjoyable even if there’s not a lot of meat on the bone. But it was not working well... when I tried turning, at least half the time it would rotate left instead of right. Same problem on the Rift S version and I haven’t had that problem in other games. The dojo however is awesome. I found it dull in the first episode but much more interesting this time around. Ultimately though doesn’t feel much different than Robo Recall, so if  not for the Star Wars gloss it would not be all that engaging. It’s a shame you can’t move around the arena and pick up more objects than just rocks and enemies. Still, for the price it’s not bad.","Sep 28, 2019 at 1:20 PM",3, 0,

Yes, it's only 40 minutes long, but it is an incredible and magical experience for only $9. When you go to a movie theatre to watch a 1.5 hour film, you don't complain at the end about replay value. And this is way more immersive than any movie. A ton of hard work was put into this and we should be grateful for it.

But very short! (The story segment is 30 mins at most). 
(I can't give 4.5 stars out of 5.0, which is what I would).


To complete all 50 rounds in the Dojo it takes 3 times the amount of time it takes for the story to end. (And this doesn't mean you get all 3 stars on the timers).

I honestly have prefered it the other way.

I think is best experienced straight after Ep1. 
So, play Ep.1 and then straight jump into Ep.2. This made the whole experience much more fluent and great! (I got the feeling the whole mini-series was thought as one full 1.5 hours experience and then chopped into pieces).","Sep 27, 2019 at 5:14 AM",4, 0,
