The ""scary noises"" (like grunting) are making me uncomfortable, but not in a scary way. I wouldn't recommend this.","Dec 26, 2018 at 4:07 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:22:32.751801,Bob-Rolha,Very sharp curves cause Motion Sickness,"This is the application that most causes Motion Sickness. Terrible VR in every way, even though I wanted to download it to test.
It could be more fun, even with all the trash and homemade production.
The producer needs to decide, or intend to give scares with the movements of the cart or if you want to give scares with the thematic setting, which is the case.
My suggestion is that, let the cart slow down and dramatically decrease the abrupt curvature of the tracks. And also not necessary so much goes up and down and so many curves. I did not even have time to enjoy the landscape, which, incidentally, is very weak. I finished with Headache and very dizzy and I do not want to repeat the experience and not show it to friends, because they will have a bad impression of VR.","Sep 7, 2018 at 2:16 AM",1, 4,"Hi Bob-Rolha, We are working on new updates, any other suggestion send for us, http://www.netdinamica.com/#contact Thank you."

2022-05-28 19:22:32.781721,Hewhosknownasiam,The single worst VR experience I've had,"This is hands down the crappiest VR experience ever made. The roller coaster is vomit inducing because the developer has no concept of inertia and you just rip around a jerky track while deafeningly loud zombie moans blast in your ears (no not in a location you pass like something is hiding around a turn, directly and loudly into your ear). Ive done dozens of VR roller coaster and never once felt sick but I couldnt even finish this one and ended up with bad VR sickness. 

Dont waste the hard drive space, this is utter trash made by someone that has no concept of how to make this type of experience.","Jul 2, 2018 at 10:43 AM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 19:22:35.876444,xbabygirlkatieex,Spooky!,There are two coasters you can ride but only one is free. The free one is still very spooky.

2022-05-28 19:22:35.891404,m0thman,"It's scary, but not in that way","The only thing that's scary is how really, really bad this app is. The motion of the coaster is all wrong and the 'scary' characters are just annoying and very 2D.  As for the sound effects, it sounded like a guy just yelling into a tape recorder back in the 80s.  As for one free ride and in-app purchases, well you can forget that as well!","Jan 11, 2018 at 5:04 AM",1, 7,"Hi m0thman, We are working on new updates, any other suggestion send for us, http://www.netdinamica.com/#contact Thank you."

2022-05-28 19:22:35.922321,Apolysus,Needed to regenerate after this,It reminded me of a low quality haunted house ride. Which can be fun of course. 2D animations and weird sound obviously made by a guy experimenting with a mice made it all quite funny.

2022-05-28 19:22:39.024025,neuro27,Dizzying Ride through a Nightmare,"The ride was pretty dizzying, nausea-inducing, but without the thrill of a real roller coaster. The audio was weird, annoying, and repetitive. The visuals were essential jpgs flashed on the screen to jump scare you, but every 5 seconds. No need to check this one out. There is a second paid ride that I wouldn't bother with, as the first free one is so bad that you should just stay away.","Nov 1, 2017 at 8:43 AM",2, 4,"Hi neuro27, We are working on new updates, any other suggestion send for us, http://www.netdinamica.com/#contact Thank you."
2022-05-28 19:22:39.040980,FastLawyer,"1 free rollercoaster, other .99 cents","So there are two different rides on this one.  The first one is free.  It is a spooky, Halloween ride on a stone casket.  It's a very dark ride with creepy sounds.  It's a little too dark to see well actually and I think the experience would have been better with a flashlight in your hand.  Regardless, the graphics are subpar and there's some creepy things that pop up.  This ride is definitely geared for kids to get them in the Halloween spirit.  It's honestly more cheesy than scary, although it has a nice ending.  I would give it 4 stars since it is free.  The other ride costs .99 cents and it's an urban rollercoaster ride also at night.  This time we can see things better.  There's some mechanical alien bug things chasing you throughout.  The rollercoaster ride itself is actually better than the first, but the alien robot bugs are just a little too hokey, too low resolution to get the intended scares (they look more like balloons IMO).  I would give this ride 2 stars.  So all together, I think it was worth .99 cents with both rides mixed in.  Pretty average roller coaster VR ride.  Could be better.  But since it's Halloween time and really low price, I do recommend it for VR Rollercoaster Enthusiasts.  Nice value for money, even if it's not the best.","Oct 8, 2017 at 3:28 PM",3, 8,"Hi Superattorney, I'm are happy to know you liked and had fun, thank you very much."

2022-05-28 19:22:42.143681,nightcat.mau,OK Coaster,"Pros: The free ride is fairly long and at least some effort went into it. It just feels like the devs had more ideas than money, though the ending of the free ride was a nice touch. 

Cons: Game was aimed at toddlers? I'm sure they would enjoy the jump scares, but they are more surprising than anything to terrify adults. Also, I was seated behind and to the left of my ""cart"" the entire time, even after resetting my game position. The scares tend to repeat themselves with only a few characters, and you will see the ending coming. 

Overall: It feels aimed at younger players which is fine, but the Halloween theme will get you in the mood to haunt your town for the little ones.","Oct 11, 2017 at 6:30 AM",3, 0,"Hi nightcat.mau, We are working on new updates, any other suggestion send for us, http://www.netdinamica.com/#contact
