2022-05-28 16:01:00.009978,XeonJa,,Started out I felt quite dizzy but soon get used to the movement. There are some many different ways to solve each puzzle. You really find yourself spending a lot of time in this game planning it out and how to come up with a methodical solution using as little number of echos.,"Nov 13, 2019 at 2:56 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:01:00.025936,LuluViBritannia,"Great concept, too easy, full of bugs","It's been a while since I've played a game with such an interesting concept. Time puzzles, that's awesome!

The ability to see our echoes is hilarious, as it allows us to see what we look like in-game.

However I see two major issues:

1) It's way too easy, due to the fact that our character is overpowered. Most of the time we have way too much echoes to complete the puzzle.
It's also easy to use roomscale and teleportation to break the limits and take shortcuts to solve the puzzle. For example, you can go through some walls without any problem.
The developers should consider making it harder. At the very least, reduce the number of echoes for each puzzle!

2) There's a lot of glitches here and there. The inertia when the character falls is not respected (the character falls straight instead of following the natural elliptic trajectory), music turns on whenever I launch the game even though I turned it off before (and it still appears turned off while it is clearly on...), sometimes my character can't close his fingers for no apparent reason, ...
But those are really small glitches, they're not game-breaking at all! I just think it is worth updating the game to fix it.
The only real issue I found is the teleportation button being on the right stick. Whenever I use the right stick to rotate, I happen to use teleportation instead...
It would be better to assign this function to the stick BUTTON: if we have to PRESS the stick, teleportation wouldn't activate so easily.


But really, those are the only issues. The concept is great, the echoes are hilarious, there's a lot of puzzles (apparently I've completed the game in 4 hours, but maybe others would struggle a bit more, thus maybe the game is actually longer), the gameplay is almost flawless and pretty natural, the graphics are great, the game runs smoothly on my laptop (i5-7300 + GTX 1050), I like the little sentences between each level, and the overall ""astral mood"".

It's definitely a great game!","Sep 16, 2019 at 10:40 PM",4, 2,"Thanks for playing! You're definitely the first person telling us it's too easy, but hopefully you still had a good time playing through it. You are definitely correct about finding ways to 'cheat' if you really try. Overall, we do have some safe guards in that try to prevent people from teleporting through walls or walking through walls but obviously it's not perfect. If people really want to find ways to cheat the puzzles they can as its their own experience they are effecting. 

Glad to hear the bugs you encountered were just cosmetic and not game breaking. We'll look into them and try to find fixes for them."
2022-05-28 16:01:00.041892,john.c.linstrum,"Beautiful Game, But...","I really want to like this game because the concept is really original, but I'm acrophobic, and wandering around on narrow virtual platforms thousands of feet in the air just isn't my cup of tea. Also, the game requires a lot of movement using the joystick, and even using teleport and click turning, the constant shifts in perspective and nervousness about falling (which is silly, but the point of VR is to seem real) get me kind of queezy fairly quickly.

It's a good game, but it shouldn't be rated on the Oculus store as ""Comfortable."" It should probably be rated ""Moderate.""  I've played other ""Moderate"" games that were way more comfortable to me than this one. Four and a half stars for the original game play, but for me it's also minus half a star for the queeziness and minus a whole star for the misleading comfort rating. :p","Jun 16, 2019 at 3:55 PM",3, 16,

2022-05-28 16:01:03.189473,JackDiddley,Unique Mind Blowing Game,"Okay, I'll start by saying I was expecting to be a little bored by this one but I wanted to try a puzzle game.  Although I am not constantly in motion, this game keeps my mind working the whole time.  It is far different from anything else I have ever played, as my first puzzle game I have to say, if this is what puzzle games are like, I'm a fan!
Seeing my past echoes walking around is fun, finding a shortcut like throwing a cube into a socket to save an echo is amazing.  There is a certain satisfaction when you finally work out the solution to one of the puzzles.  What I find the most fascinating is the use of VR, this game is not possible any other way.  There is no way to do this on a flat screen.
I haven't completed all of the puzzles yet but I definitely will.  More like this will get my money any day!","Jan 27, 2019 at 1:48 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 16:01:03.204434,IanRBland,A tool for brain development,"This is a mind-bender.  There are few games I will allow my children to play, but this one I consider a brilliant tool for the development of young brains.  Thinking in terms of time-lines is something that NOBODY is challenged with.  I wish I had been challenged with such puzzles at an age when my brain's neurons were still building connections.  As soon as my son figured out the key principle, he jumped for joy.  Transpose should not be classified under ""game"".  It should be classified under ""intelligence builder"". 

Graphics:  Trippy.   Other wordly.  Great job!
Tech:  Worked flawlessly on Oculus Rift.   Question: will the sign ""Turn to face the sensors"" pop up with a 3-sensor configuration?

This one is a GEM!","Nov 11, 2018 at 1:24 AM",5, 24,"Thanks for the review, we're happy you are enjoying the game. 
As for the ""Turn to face the sensors"" UI, yes we have options to disable this if you have 3 sensors."

2022-05-28 16:01:03.249313,nrosko,,"Only 20 min in first impressions, so far great puzzle game. 
If you like Form this has a similar look but i would say even more weird. I think the atmosphere including the music is really well done. Only issue is the game suffers from colour banding like the colour bit rate is too low in certain areas. Not sure if this is down to Oculus or the game itself. Also the animation of the other version of you looked a bit wooden. That aside it looks great overall. 
The puzzles are not too difficult so far but with this concept of time manipulation it could get difficult (think of the film Primer) so i'm looking forward to some challenges.","Nov 9, 2018 at 8:24 PM",4, 3,

 My Quick Thoughts:
An impressive looking puzzle game in VR with great scope and mind bending time travel mechanics. I must admit I was lost at first as how the mechanic worked, but all fell into place after I managed to complete 2 or 3 of the puzzles.","Nov 8, 2018 at 3:43 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 16:01:06.348025,Darcangel777,Great potential but needs more love,Graphics are good and the concept interesting. Movement is the big problem as the teleport distance is very limited and snap turn is buggy. Please Please Please include a smooth turn option for rift touch controllers.,"Nov 7, 2018 at 5:21 PM",3, 8,"Thanks for the feedback and sorry hear you are having trouble with the controls. We are implementing a smooth rotate option right now, so look out for a patch early next week!"
