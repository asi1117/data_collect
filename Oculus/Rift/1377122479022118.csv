2022-05-28 19:40:24.411324,MikeML,,"I'd love to write a user review of this coaster, but of the 15 roller coaster ride apps I've downloaded, this is the ONLY one that will not run. Intro looks GREAT, but neither the controller or keyboard buttons will start this coaster.
My system is the Samsung Odyssey with the Alienware 15 R3 laptop.
Anyone know of a workaround for this WMR configuration?","Jun 30, 2018 at 1:49 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 19:40:24.428279,nightcat.mau,Promising Start,"This game feels very alpha at the moment. Using the game pad you can either get a tiny demo coaster, and I mean tiny, or a space shooter. The coaster itself feels beta and is over just as it starts getting good. It is a decent coaster, but very short. Then there is the space shooter where your wonky drift will make sighting and firing on targets almost impossible. There are no control guides and when they tell you to go somewhere after shooting your enemies you have no ideas where. The devs are clearly trying, but if it's going to be a coaster the coaster has to be awesome like the intro. Make that into a ride and you'll be golden. PS Gamepad only, so best of luck!","Jun 18, 2018 at 3:28 AM",3, 0,

I want my $$$ back.","Oct 19, 2017 at 6:57 AM",1, 1,Touch Controller not work at tis time. Only a Xbox controller is working. With the next update the touch controlle will be integrated.
2022-05-28 19:40:27.577900,RexKibble,Awful,"As others have said, buggy, unrealistic and should be free.","Sep 16, 2017 at 12:45 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:40:27.592860,OoaliceoO,Should be Free,"Buggy Coaster, feels awful compared with others, part of Screen is covered by Car. Luckily it is extremly short. Just as the bonus level. Takes double as long to figure controls (one simple screen telling what does what on the Gamepad would be helpful...) as to shoot some stuff in space and you are done. Only interesting part would be what happens if you visit a planet, but that is where the demo ends. So I better play Eve.","May 15, 2017 at 6:41 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:40:27.608819,ksn,Just a demo for money,"Low quality roller coaster with bugs. Just one level, about 40 seconds of rolling - that's all.
It does NOT cost money at all, items like that should be free demo. It's shame to sell stuff like that.
Do NOT buy it.","Apr 28, 2017 at 5:14 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:40:27.624775,TheArtfulWedger,It would even be a waste of 1p,"Do not buy this utter rubbish, my virtual puke is all over my virtual lap, 79p and I want my money back, if I could go back I would go and spend the money on bag of dog crap from someone in the park and it would be more fun, I'm gonna put my headset back on and let my friends take turns to wack me on the back of the head with a baseball bat for being so stupid, oh and did I mention DON'T BUY THIS.","Apr 13, 2017 at 4:09 AM",1, 4,"Thank you for the nice review. But please tell me what do you don´t like.
Did you don´t see the video.It tell that this is an roller coaster simulator.
Please tell me your paypal email and i will send your money back. I think this is not your app. Best regards Claudio P."
