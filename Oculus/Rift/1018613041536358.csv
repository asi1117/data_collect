PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do something about when you take your headset off and then back on, that super annoying Bigscreen logo popping up in the middle of the screen. WHY? What purpose does it serve?

If you're just trying to use this to watch a video or play a game you'll have to deal with a bunch of online-centric nonsense being pushed in your face when all you want to use is use a screen in a comfortable environment.

It's okay once you get used to its quirks, but it would be nice if there was a ""solo"" mode that was cut-down and just let you use the screen without also pretending its a VRchat competitor.",Nov 7 at 11:27 AM,3, 33,

I went into the lobby and met Dragon67 and he immediately showed me the ropes. Taught me all I needed to know to navigate the lobby and many different things in Bigscreen. From there I met a whole new family I never dreamed I would have. I gotta say, there were times when things got sideways with people acting up, being disrespectful. But the mods have always handled it with grace and made sure that the rest of us have a great environment to be in. I found out they do it for the love of it and it gives me a greater respect for them.

2022-05-28 15:23:47.187934,FenrizUlven,Great way to emulate being in a cinema..,"I have a had a good time using bigscreen. there is cool public rooms with people streaming all kinds of stuff from their desktop and there is tons of Chanels with movies, tv shows and documentaries provided by pluto TV, im honestly suprised there isnt more people using this app and watching content. I have a couple of issues on being in bigscreen I wish the devs could fix: when I watch a movie in one of the pluto TV channels there is to many pauses of the movie, living in Denmark I only get a screen with some graphics saying ""pluto tv"" for 5 minutes (I assume this is commercials in the states instead of just the screen) This however makes the movies pretty much unwatchable, its to many of them in one movie, I could accept one long break inbetween movies and the same in the middle, but every 15-20 minutes is to much, especially when I just have to stare at nothing happening for 5 minutes every time. I think you would make more revenue on commercials with more people watching and less breaks. That being said, there is some great movies being shown, I especially enjoy the ""cult movies"" and ""Horror"" chanels. :)

My other issue is that when you put the controllers down to enjoy the movie and they go in sleep mode, your hands float in the air right in front of your face, please fix this. Otherwise great job Devs! thanks for making it easy to get that cinema feel at home. :)",Oct 23 at 4:23 AM,4, 4,

There is a delay on one end when streaming to someone, regardless of how fast your connection is - and no ability to delay the video to sync it up. 90% of the time, the time craps out within an hour. Whoever it craps out for has to restart the program and try again - a real pain when it's the host. Had to do it 4 times tonight and just gave up. Sound is a big issue, but sometimes video doesn't work. Can watch Youtube in Bigscreen, but not dis+, Netflix, Hulu, or even Spectrum Live TV. Has not been a problem for months until tonight. Buuuut, if I switch to Firefox it suddenly works - until the sound craps out.

Hosting when I connect to link it allows 12 users and worked pretty perfect. Audio was in sync and picture was nice and clear.

Has decent free tv channels that I went in and out of no problem both through quest 2 and link. I like it mainly for hosting my own stuff. Not sure why so many having problems. I guessing cause they not in US.

2022-05-28 15:23:50.345488,Yayyoung,Implementing room creation,"I believe having the ability to design a room would be a pretty nice option to have, such as creating your own house/room. The picture quality is alright, when you're watching a subtitled video the subtitles tend to be pixelated, I'm assuming it's because of the distance or resolution of the personal screen/bigscreen (could just be the headset), but I would love for long-distance viewing such as sitting at the home environment with HD quality instead of being slightly pixelated (The further away you are from the screen, the more pixelated it gets.

We correct the problem by the non-host leaving and re-entering the room.  But, over the course of a couple hours, having to do this like 10 times.... ugh.  I'll gladly invest some money for you all to make it just that much better.

Also, would be nice to have a dedicated room code.  Here lately (April 2021), the app crashes while I'm in a private room with one friend, and each time I have to give out a new code.  Takes too much time.","Apr 25, 2021 at 11:54 PM",4, 21,

Sorry because of licensing you can't watch anything BYE!!!!

What is all that about do they not want people to watch their movies?? Top Gun came out the same year I was born and is one of my best movies, love it! seen it hundreds of times but never seen it in 3D.
So here I am at Big Screen looking at everybody going to watch it and I can't even see the trailer to it.. So sad so wrong  we are not here forever we are wasting time and missing out on so many things because of nonsense licensing and copyrights etc etc.

Sort it out lol

For the response:

Yeah licensing is out of you're hands and licensing needs to change we are in 2021 where everyone is connected in real time... Not the good old days where you could roll out a movie in little areas because it was impossible to see it anywhere else... Times have changed and licensing needs to catch up otherwise this happens... Just because I live in the UK I can't see a simple movie on Bigscreen... Bit of a slap in the face either everyone should be able to view it or nobody should be able to view it, plus in order for me, if I could that is to watch Top Gun in 3D on Bigscreen I would have to pay for it, so what are they doing?? it's lost revenue.... lol","Mar 6, 2021 at 9:58 PM",3, 15,

However I acknowledge this is a beta. For a beta this is amazing and I cant wait to see what comes next. If there could be a feature to directly invite your oculus friends to your private room that would be great. I also wish the movement could reach across the whole room for easier movement. I also wish the video stream quality could be increased when sharing both screens (we kept having issues where it would revert to 720p, not 1080). Issues where someone could stream youtube, but not a video that is on their desktop seems kinda redundant, since you dont have to have the same file for the youtube video but must have the same file to watch someones replay or something like that.

Inviting friends should be simpler, and the need for everyone to rent  to movie in  a room isa bit sad. The lack of playing your own 3d movies is an obvious cash grab. Do we really need  another pseudo streaming service/ rental company. This just smacks of greed. I have no problem buying the software at a reasonable price if its fully functional or even buy the initial version and then cheaper full version updates as long as they are reasonable with what is included with a full version update.

Avatars can be turned off. It's kind of creepy to have these things next to you, when all you want a private viewing in a fun and secluded environment. I eventually found the setting to get rid of them but I spent way too much time looking for it. the settings UI is bad. 

3D is abysmal for movies. I tried to watch a 3D version of Ghost In The Shell. I wanted to see it in 3D. I wanted eye popping 3D. Nope didnt get it, and I spent hours trying to get it to work and nothing did.  The movie stuttered, froze and was just a waste of money experience.

2022-05-28 15:24:47.164518,TheReviewer,An Honest Review!,"Big screen works great on the oculus rift s, but is still a tiny bit buggy.  In this review I will give you a list of the Pros and the cons, for the oculus Rift S.  

Pros


1: You can mirror what is on your computer screen, and watch movies. 
2: You may think that sitting with a VR headset on and watching a movie may make you dizzy.  But this is not the case.  I watched Toy Story 4 and it was great!
3: Multiplayer is great, although sometimes, annoying kids get in the way.  But.. You could watch movies with your friends, in a private room!
4: You could watch and play games in any room you want!
5: If you want to watch a movie offered by BigScreen you need to buy tickets (this is good so you could avoid annoying trolls)


Cons:

1: When moving seats you tend to lose the Control screen (where you are, and the seat teleportation) and often have to remove my headset and press Computer only, then game options.
2: If I have a friend watching the game on one of my 2 monitors.  They would often see the bigScreen control panel which is on my monitor.  You are unable to move it around on your monitor.  
3: I would bet it would be less fun on the oculus quest, if not connected to a computer.


As one can tell, there are more pros than cons.  If the cons do not bug you that much, then go ahead and get this game!  It is free after all!","Feb 28, 2020 at 2:42 AM",4, 44,

Also, you really should be able to use the Xbox One gamepad with this, with aiming by just looking around with your head, and hide away the virtual hands.

They've added all sorts of useless junk and made deals with studios, but they never got peer to peer video sharing working reliably. Even when two people are on symmetric 100MB connections and a few miles apart, we see our video going to servers in Virginia while we're in California. And their UI is tasteless. 7+ character lowercase room codes? How about 6 characters of hex with a dash in the middle, or three words?

The experience between Oculus Go is completely broken too--microphone audio doesn't send to anyone else. It's not like Oculus has more than three devices for them to support...

I'd happily pay $50, $100 even for shrinkwrap software that my friend and I can use to share our screens. That's it. No effing popcorn or tomatoes or old movies we don't want to watch.

This app is junk. I've followed for years and never had one good session. I'm finally done with it and hoping they fail sooner than later so there comes a new game in town.

If Big Screen worked the way it's supposed to, it would get a 5-star rating.  Especially how well they designed the Big Cinema Theater.  It's so good, I keep on trying to give it another chance every couple of weeks.  Unfortunately, since Oculus Rift first came out (which was when I was using it), it would always crash at every session.  Watching a movie? Crash.  Reduce all graphic settings to low quality so it'll be more stable? Crash.  Just browsing on the web? Crash.  I  was hoping it'd be fixed by now, but it's worse than ever.  At this point it's unusable.  It gets 2 starts instead of 1, because they cinema is so well designed.  At our office we have several different types of desktops and laptops we use for VR and this program crashes on every one of them.","Mar 15, 2020 at 1:03 PM",5, 4,

They advertise 3d movies, so I thought I'd check it out. I was not expecting much in the way of quality. I quickly updated my thinking once I saw the result. The 3d effect is spectacular. The images on the screen are clear. Not at all distorted.

The only downside that I saw was that they charge an admission to watch the 3d movies ($4.99). The movies listed weren't that good, mostly 6.?, IMDB rating. Now, if they showed better quality movies, I'd be all in. They are showing Titanic at this time and it looks great (preview room). Maybe if more people purchase a ticket (remember movie theater), they would be willing to upgrade the quality of movie.

I think the concept is amazing and has the potential to revolutionize how we consume media.  The problem is the company really needs to devote more time and resources into fixing bugs and regression testing - every new release seems to break something.

Unfortunately in it's current state (December 2019) it's a buggy mess I often end up leaving in frustration after only a few minutes.  I have tried the app over the past 6 months on both Quest and Rift-S and I'd have to say it's slightly more stable on the Quest.  On PC, I constantly encounter issues with the microphone not working (how about a volume meter in app so we can tell if it's receiving audio properly?), volume levels, video streaming inconsistency (in server-based rooms, not peer-to-peer).

I'm looking to watch movies not socialise with 12 year olds please don't speak to me.  Then when you start watching the movie you can hear chattering and people mis-behaving and throwing popcorn.

Movie-theatres are not social places.  They're movie-watching places.  The fact that other people happen to be there is irrelevant to the core-experience.

It's a social app in which you can make friends in the lobby and create your own private rooms or joins friends rooms to watch Movies that you can put on your computer's desktop and stream them upto 12 people in one room, but also you can play video games so others can view and watch it with you, host a music night and play some songs and have a right party with your mates. And now with the new movie nights update from Bigscreen VR the whole vitual cinema experience is finally coming home yet at the moment about one movie works for the uk and the rest are region locked to different countries I hope this gets fixed so uk people can purchase a movie ticket and watch films straight from the cinemas, at the moment only older movies are being shown due to regulation and it's only new the update came out around the 16th December 2019. I've seen the 3d preivews of the trailers in the room and the quality looks beyond 1080 and look amazing this is what we need. I hope Bigscreen come out with a Netflix style subscription maybe by Paramount which would be nice if some movies from the cinema were released on here at the same time as the app version even if you had to pay £10 or £15 per ticket I would beats going to the cinema, this would also help people who wanted to go to the cinema and couldn't due to being disabled and not able to get out of the house. The App still is a long way off from doing that but as time goes on we hope and prey this app doesn't get abandoned.","Dec 22, 2019 at 4:59 AM",4, 3,

Alone, it isn't ALL that fun; you might as well just use your actual desktop after you get past the wow-factor. With my brother and our mutual friend with a VR headset, however, Bigscreen has got to be one of the most useful VR apps in existence. My brother and I actually just watched Ready Player One in the home theater setting, and that was hands down my favorite VR experience yet, just for the novelty factor. That was the kind of replayability that I feel VR has been lacking. If the BSB devs could figure out how to iron out streaming a tiny bit more (both he and I have PLENTY of up/down bandwidth [400+ megabit], yet him streaming the movie to my end had a few major buffer moments), it'd be perfect. However, I'm not some twit that doesn't understand latency and its correlation to bandwidth, and feels the need to blame any and every problem on the developers, so I will not knock BSB at ALL for some netcode problems. Also, after our movie was done, we scooted up to our desks and played some BF3 in a virtual LAN party with two other random guys watching us. Was incredible.

Great work devs, and thank you for this app.

Edit; Having read a few other reviews below me, I can say with confidence that many, if not all, of the problems one might experience while using this app are related to user-error. Experiment people, press buttons, do things. Figure it the f**k out before blaming the devs and bombing the app's ratings. Despicable.

Edit #2 7/22/2019; I did like the theater that was removed, but jesus h. christ people, it isn't the end of the world. You people got this app for FREE, yet you feel entitled to b*tch about one feature being removed. Still a 5-star experience every time I play BSB, and I have no complaints. The sound bugs that used to be rampant are essentially fixed with the simple ""Refresh Audio Stream"" button too.","Jul 23, 2019 at 7:22 AM",5, 143,
2022-05-28 15:25:34.577705,HousePainter,This is the reason I bought VR,"Had no idea this would end up being the reason I have VR.  I originally bought my Rift for iRacing, and it works really well for that.  But I took a break from sim racing and my Rift started collecting dust.  I happened to see Bigscreen recently, read some of the reviews, and gave it a try.  Now it's my favorite VR app by a huge margin.  

Bigscreen is the closest thing to playing any game in VR.  The main thing I wanted from VR was the ability to play existing games in a more immersive perspective with a normal gamepad.  Playing in Bigscreen isn’t technically ""VR,"" but it might as well be when you have a huge screen wrapped in front of you, encompassing your entire vision.  When I was doing some dogfighting in BF:V, my stomach was turning just like it would in VR.  Luckily I’m not very susceptible to motion sickness.  

On the complete opposite end of the comfort spectrum, you can finally put a huge screen on the ceiling and watch movies laying down.  Once I started using Bigscreen, I bought HDMI/USB 3.0 extensions so my headset can reach anywhere in the room.  Now I can control my computer, play games, and watch movies while sitting, standing, laying, or doing frickin power lunges and jumping jacks if I wanted.  

It's also easy to use, and works flawlessly for the most part.  Occasionally, I'll have issues trying to control the mouse on the desktop with the touch controllers, but that could just as easily be the fault of the touch controllers or Windows.  Once you launch into a fullscreen game and start using a gamepad, everything works great.  Battlefield V ran twice as smooth when I switched from a 120hz screen to a 60hz one and used Vsync.  So if things don't look smooth in Bigscreen for you, try lowering your monitor's refresh rate to something equal to or less than your headset (90hz).  

TL;DR: Best VR app ever.","Sep 14, 2019 at 2:14 PM",5, 15,

I think that would get some people in there. also I love the big cinema theater. I would however like smooth locomotion walking option. I dont like teleporting! offer both modes. also maybe make more ""home rooms"" to pick from. although I do kinda like the new space age bachelor pad with the rumba cleaning the flood but I would like more options.  anyways thanks for keeping this alive!","Jul 18, 2019 at 2:24 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:25:53.609801,user045,Improving all the time,"My TV Update review.  The new home room looks and works great.  Its lovely to see and know some new improved environments are coming our way including themed ones. The movie and cinema quality keeps getting better.  Overall a fantastic sound and vision movie experience. 3D looks great. Looking forward to buying 2D but especially 3D films such as TRON Legacy.

Small niggles worth highlighting: Avatars too bright. Hands remain in view for too long before disappearing. The assumption is that we want to watch the new TV channels in the Big Cinema or Home environment when I prefer the smaller screens. The Big Cinema environment screen is too low and too big in my face (my personal opinion - appreciate other opinions may differ on this). Some TV Channels don't work or need to be refreshed a few times before they work. For example, news channels. When I block people in Big Cinema, when new people arrive I cannot block them so need to go out and back in to block again. Hope this helps.","Jul 16, 2019 at 11:15 PM",5, 6,

They are angry and disappointed because they have an emotional attatchment to the software and wished it to be all that they dreamed.

Once you figure out that the initial scene has nothing but an open menu you then fall across finding the Lobby which is just a change of scene.
Here it has cameras I really don't know what any do and then after more fumbling around you find Rooms to join.
Once in a Cinema you are sat with the Menu Screen still Open and piss about trying to close it (= use Right Thumb Stick)
Then you got your Desktop to panic about too. Not sure if everyone can see it so be careful here!
To close that it seems to need Button B (Right Touch) on the arrow at the top right.

However this latest update has a few odd new flaws.. The biggest barrier at first is the Avatar editor, when you first load it up.. It used to give you a selection wheel with many options visible, so you knew where they were and what they would do.. But for some reason, with this latest update, they've seemingly downgaded that feature, to a ""push button to cycle through every option one at a time, and good luck remembering where the one you want is"" system.
Before this update, I could set my avatar up the way I liked it, in a matter of minutes.. Now, if I bother to spend the time, it's probably going to take me over 10 minutes to cycle through everything until I've seen the options and remember where the one I want is. ugh.","Feb 17, 2019 at 3:36 AM",4, 4,

- shared rooms for movie nights (I have not tried this as I have no friends and I am awkward around strangers :-D )
- brightness option 
- it is free 

Cons:
- lack of tutorial. Really, please make some controls guide. It was not exactly easy figuring all controls out.
- accidental screen moving. Sometimes I accidentaly move screen without wanting to do so. Make some sort of lock or more complex move gesture.

Show an audio symbol over people's heads when they are speaking. That would make it easier to mute them if they have background noise or are just completely oblivious when entering a room to watch a movie. 

Set the mute to auto when a user first enters a room. This is not a user error, but an app error because it is not intuitive for new users. Time and time again when watching a flick and someone new enters the room, more often than not they will say, ""Oh they are watching (insert movie name). Oh my god, can you guys hear me?! I think they can hear me. Sorry!""  And someone from the audience will say, ""Yeah, we can hear you, shut up!""  

Lastly, the app could really use a few more bigger movie theater environments just so it doesn't become stale. I've been using the same large movie theater to host my sessions. Please change it up :)

2022-05-28 15:27:06.461947,BobbyGophast,Fun for movies,"This is a fun little app and just what I was looking for and it's free! There are plenty of ways to view video and windows in VR. But I was looking for a proper theater experience with a proper size screen at the proper distance. This app does that nicely. The ‘big cinema’ environment feels just like you are there. The only thing missing is the popcorn smell and that’s easy enough to add and I did.
It needs more ‘big cinema’ type environments as the small screen environments just don’t have the same impact for watching movies. The home theater environment makes it feel like you’re watching in a home theater but to me that doesn’t have the same impact as a big screen. A 10’ screen viewed at 10’ may fill the same field of view in your vision as a 50’ screen at 50’ but for some reason it just doesn’t have the same psychological impact. Plus focusing at infinity is easier on the eyes (for most people) so a screen that is far away is less eye straining. Point being that more big screen environments would be great for watching movies. I’m old enough to remember drive-ins and that would be a great environment for movies. With in-car seating option complete with interiors and the option for tinny sound from a speaker hanging from your window. Then of course you can have the outside lawn chair, car hood and snack bar table seating options. That would be a fun environment for getting together in.
Another would be ‘movies in the pool’. I’ve always enjoyed this in real life and I’d probably be fun in VR too. Do forget the poolside bar. Which reminds me. Stock up on straws because pretty much anything but a bottle is a pain to drink from while wearing a VR headset and I don’t know about you but I snack when I watch movies.
Of course the other cool feature is that you can host a public or private room for whatever activity you want. But that also makes me wonder about copyright law and how long these types of apps will be around once VR is mainstream. There is nothing to stop me","Sep 17, 2018 at 12:05 AM",4, 3,

Be aware the hardware specs are high for tho.

The streaming quality is usually seemless and even has the cool feature of being able to stream video in 3D and is a go-to app for virtual desktop simulation on the Oculus. As a gaming alternative however, is horrendous. This app has been advertised to support gameplay through the oculus headset and screenshots showed Overwatch being played within the app, my experience with trying to play any sort of games has been troublesome. First off, I've noticed that whenever I take off my Oculus headset and leave the app in idle, it immediatly clocks my CPU to 100% and lowers back to normal whenever I put it back on which is concerning. And whenever a game or app goes into fullscreen, that creates issues too. I tried to play Danganronpa 2 (a game comprised of 2D and basic 3D assets) in Bigscreen and I noticed that as soon as I used my controller in fullscreen (because I use a controller on PC) the keyboard and mouse immediately locked up and still didn't work after closing the Oculus app thus forcing me to perform a hard restart. In the end, it's good for videos and bad for gaming.","May 26, 2018 at 2:38 PM",3, 3,

The dynamic lighting is a bit too strong, the ghosting is really attenuated because of this. And the Home Cinema was my favorite scene but since the update it's very woody now and very dark. like a 70's home cinema. Much prefered the light themed Home cinema, I'm back to the Grand cinema as my favorite scene. aside from that my favorite video player, like to see more cinema scenes in the future..there isn't a app that offers the functionallity that BS does, so i'm hooked. TIP: when watching movies with vlc player I highly recommend going in the the EXTRA'S menu and then effects and filters go to the video tab  and use the saturation slider to give movies the colour that the Rift can not show on it's own, then use the contrast slider and search for a outdoor scene, make sure you still can see a bit of clouds and trees in the sky.

It had extra features for behind the scenes.  The stream was about 99% with the movie screening.  Don't expect it to work 100% even when windows10 or other programs are updating in the background. Not a great idea to see it in a public theatre where people are standing up in front of you or coughing and sneezing in your ears that are not on your friends list and even with personal bubble selected.  Even in the public theatre some people's hair on their avatars are glowing which takes away from the experience. 
 Very useful virtual desktop app but when you first open the app you jump into your private room and then it reloads into a public room and you see to your suprise ""Everyone can see this screen"" your desktop!  Scary at first trying to rush the panel to open to get you back into your private room because you know, you might just have a naked picture of yourself open.  An option to first load into a private room would be really nice and not be forced to reload into a public room.  Wish I could use my ATSC Tuner with it.","Mar 10, 2018 at 4:17 AM",3, 5,

The app is not only extremely immersive and fun to use, but it also has a streamlined design which enhances productivity, for example you can use a built in capture mode alongside your recording software if you wish to record your Bigscreen experiences, easily from within the app. Recently, Bigscreen has also partnered up with Paramount pictures to bring Top Gun 3D VR, alongside it's announcement of a virtual movie theatre update soon to be available to US residents, and internationally in the future. The app is available on most of the major platforms including Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Windows MR, and there are already plans to bring the app to Oculus Go in early 2018.

Another room had a young film maker showing his portfolio on youtube and soliciting people's feedback.

What was really helpful is how Bigscreen highlights buttons on the touch controllers.  I was up and running in seconds!  Zooming in, rotating, zooming out...it was a breeze.  The ability to left-click/right-click with either controller is helpful too.  You can move desktops around with one touch controller while pointing and clicking with the other.

I created a desktop that seemed as big as a movie theater screeen and spent hours just watching movies!

It reminded me of that scene in ""Minority Report"" where Tom Cruise uses his hands to move desktops around.  YOU CAN DO THAT WITH BIGSCREEN!  Way too cool.

- The placement of the screen is good but it would be nice to not have it re-center every time I go to adjust the screen. Im not to sure how to improve this other than giving the end user the ability to ""Drag"" and place the main screen so we can see the ""Big Screen"" in the back ground.

Thanks to this app, I am litteraly reliving my childhood as it is now possible to have lan partys with friends again. And there are alot of hidden gems possible with this app.
So Bigscreen let's the user enter a virtual room where others are (solo play is also a possibility btw) hanging out. You see your own monitor and you can choose to curve it, make it bigger, use it as 3d side by side screen and set the distance.
So alot of people are using this to play together such as Rocket League and all that, but I personally am already over 300 hours playing Wii/gamecube games against other people.
You can play any Wii/Gamecube game you want together with friends inside Bigscreen using the Dolphin emulator which has a netplay setting. You can just create a internetlobby for a friend and he can join a ""local network"" game .There is also a native Side by Side setting so every game has 3d mode aswell.
So imagine playing Mario kart,super smash brawl, dragonball Z tenkaichi 3 (in freaking 3d) and all that together with people all over the world next to each other ..It's all possible in Bigscreen .. not to mention the various other functionality it provides such as movie watching/troubleshooting other people/just hang out and have fun.. It's for free, it gets updated alot and the developers are very interactive with the vr/reddit community. Don't miss out on this","Nov 13, 2016 at 11:18 PM",5, 9,
