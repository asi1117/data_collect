2022-05-28 20:39:10.012765,QAII,"Unique, Creative and fun","EDIT***** The recent update addressed most of the bugs and issues I had with the game elevating it to 5 instead of 4 stars. Great game, great developer and thanks for putting the work into a truly unique and amazing experience. If I had to be really nitpicky, some of the voice acting is still pretty quiet (greatly improved however) but other than that I have no complaints!
-Old Review-
I personally love all of tender claws games, they have a unique charm to them and are crazy experiences, and Virtual Virtual Reality 2 is no different, however I think the scale of the sequel hurt the game because there are tons of bugs (spawning in wrong areas, overlapping voices, etc.) that holds back the experience. I still am enjoying it, but it would be nice if a lot of areas were more polished. I also still recommend trying it if you're interested either way.",Feb 26 at 10:50 AM,5, 25,"Hi QAII, thanks for your feedback! We've released an update to VVR2 that includes a large number of bug fixes and general improvements to gameplay."

I would like to be able to change some settings like supersampling, anti aliasing and such, sadly those kind of settings are missing right now :/",Apr 18 at 8:36 AM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:39:10.042686,RockStarG,Great! but buggy (there going to fix it),"Im not going to ignore the bugs but I know there working on it! Its super fun and diffrent from other games. Im exited to finish, but right now I cant. there seems to be a bug because I cant go through a door no matter what I do. I would wait to buy it until they patch the bugs.",Feb 21 at 11:33 AM,5, 12,"Hi RockStarG, thanks for leaving a review!
