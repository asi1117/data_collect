2022-05-28 18:33:08.877594,cav800,Buggy mess...,"This game started off pretty cool. Then the more I played, the more I encountered things that were not so cool such as constantly losing your sword. I mean this thing is always flying across the room and then I find myself teleporting all over the place looking for another one. Another huge problem I have with this game is the awful checkpoint save system. When you die (because you keep losing your sword), you must replay the entire level all over again. Another issue is that when you come in contact with an object such as a table or door, the camera pushes you back, which causes me a great deal of nausea. The weapon behind your back thing is also extremely buggy where it works sometimes and sometimes it just doesn't. A final issue I had with the game is the awkward floating menu where it becomes a serious challenge just to select what you want. I spent over two hours trying to give this game a chance and then of course I couldn't get a refund. There are some issues with this game so be warned.","Mar 16, 2021 at 12:21 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 18:33:08.892554,lefthome,Outstanding. A real gem.,"It's not a massive 70+ hour game, but this is a complete experience. I went in mostly blind, thinking it was a chunky minecraft-graphic-having dungeon crawler and it kept surprising me. The environments are amazing, the enemies feel like they have personality, and it did jump scare me several times. Controls are simple enough to become transparent eventually although in a panic you may drop your sword or bow (or axe, or torch, or lantern, or giant cheese wheel) at times.

The sounds and music are perfect and there are a few puzzles and secrets scattered throughout the game. It's easy to play a level in just less than half hour so you can play long or short sessions, but you might be tempted to sit there for 5 or 6 hours and play straight through. I chose to savour it over the course of a week, reattempting a couple of levels if I missed a secret the first time through.

I played on the easiest level so the battles weren't terribly tough. I mostly died if I was ambushed by a few enemies or to a trap. This isn't dark souls, but the fights are fun. Velocity of your weapon definitely counts, so swing away, but watch your furniture. 

Don't sleep on this one if you like adventure games. It deserves more attention. It shows what a developer with some imagination and creativity can do, and it stays fresh the whole way through.","Oct 25, 2020 at 7:45 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:33:12.002237,FlacoCholo,Great Adventure RPG,"Wonderfully designed game. The graphics are beautiful as previously mentioned. There is a TON of content in this game. Besides the main storyline, (which can take up to 5+ hours), there is a wave mode where each wave has a number of enemies you need to eliminate, and you fight to see how many level you can survive (This part is great for replayability). Enemies drop in-game coin that you use to buy new weapons and fun potions that restore health, increase power, or temporary invulurability. I really enjoyed the grind to unlock better.  There are so many different weapons, it's amazing.  Bows, swords, maces, daggers, shields, bombs, torches, etc. Very enjoyable gameplay, and not nauseating at all (if you do get dizzy, you can adjust how focused in the screen gets when you move so you don't get dizzy).  An added plus, the devs are very quick to respond to everything. Definitely worth buying, great game.","Jul 4, 2020 at 1:15 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 18:33:15.144832,hippocoder,Needs to be smoother?,"The game is quite a lot of fun but I prefer to move with stick. Unfortunately there is no interpolation or movement smoothing for hands nor locomotion so unfortunately you get this sort of strobe effect when moving which is not very nice. Despite this, it's fun poking around in dark places!  Please try to fix the lack of interpolation though.

The PC is an overclocked monster that can play Asgard's Wrath on Epic just fine so it is not a hardware issue.","Dec 19, 2019 at 12:01 PM",4, 1,"Hi hippocoder. Thanks for the review! I'm not sure if it's a performance issue you are referring to or the lack of interpolation for moving by stick. If it's the latter, on the option screen there's a tick box for 'Movement acceleration' that interpolates based on stick position. Happy to discuss this further on our Discord if you'd like."
2022-05-28 18:33:15.161786,Defink,Best dungeon crawler IMO,"Pros:
- With this kind of graphics the 'god ray' effect of Rift is canceled out + the scenery can be quite gorgeous.
- Combat system with Parry/Slash/Stab feels good. (A little hint for new players: hit their knees).

Cons:
- Like most Rift titles it's kind of short (Early acces, they're planning to add another 3 levels if I look at the progress statues in-game: which is around 30-45minutes).
- Ranged is kind of clunky: my bow is not where my controller is, and if I tilt it up and down it kind of feels weird: also has no effect on the trajectory of the arrow if I tilt my bow or not (is what I feel).
- (Small scenery spoiler ahead) at a certain time you're in a cave with not alot of light: to engage in combat I drop my lantern and get blinded by all the lights of swinging/blocking.

A must have for Rift even in Early acces!","Oct 25, 2019 at 8:08 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:33:15.176746,HeliosTXG,Pretty good for an early VR game,"I originally bought this game on sale for around $10, and I gotta say I am loving it. The story is a little basic, like OG Legend of Zelda basic, but what little story they have so far is really creative! The simple polygonal graphics work really well on my mid-tier GPU, and the combat and controls are really intuitive.
However, I did only give this three stars for a few reasons. First of all: VR sickness. That little thing people were worried about when VR first came out is absolutely REAL, so make sure to stick with the teleport movement instead of the smooth running, but that's more of a personal problem that can be fixed with practice. Second, the collisions are super weird, like I'll try to open a door and get stuck in the wall for a full minute before I'm able to wiggle my setup enough to get out, or I'll pick up an enemy's weapon, and it'll go flying across the room and into the floor, where I can't reach it to add to my collection. And I've lost count of the number of times I've swung at an enemy and either gotten the blade wedged between the enemy's head and shoulder and stuck, or tangled up with the torch or second sword in my left that I'm using to block between swings. 
In conclusion (like anyone's actually going to bother reading this far), this is definitely a great game to get for low- to mid-tier setups for those with no problems with motion sickness, but be prepared for a few bugs, which are to be expected, as this is still in early access.","Oct 2, 2019 at 12:59 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 18:33:15.191706,Elgsdyr,,Decent visuals but feels pretty amateurish and nothing like something that (apparently) is nearing full launch. Needs much gentler transition from e.g. standing still to start moving. I have no problem with smooth locomotion in most other games but this one is... challenging. And the fighting mechanics are not very thought through. I kept changing weapon when using the power attack. Also the menu system etc. were poorly designed and very confusing. Very clear refund for me...,"Nov 2, 2019 at 8:30 AM",2, 1,"Hi Elgsdyr, sorry you didn't like the game. I just wanted to clarify that by default movement has no acceleration/transition (this is to limit velocity changes as this is linked to motion sickness). In game options you can set movement acceleration on, which allows smooth transition into movement like you mention."
2022-05-28 18:33:15.206667,Pingpongchow,Fantastic game!,"I've only played about an hour or so of this game and so far i am loving it! Great graphics, smooth gameplay on a mid-range gaming pc and amazing feel to the game.

The dev has really nailed the combat system, swinging and blocking are really satifying (not quite in the same league as Blade & Sorcery combat) but still very very good.

I love the eerie feel to the dungeons and the little jump scares now and then, very simple puzzle solving which is nice as i'm playing to fight monsters not do a mensa test ;)

So why haven't you given this 5 stars? you may ask, one simple reason.. As much as i am loving this game the only annoying thing in it is the backpack system where you grab behind your shoulder for your weapons, it really isn't working out for me, i put the bow on my left shoulder and a sword on my right, i grab for my sword and it ends up grabbing the bow or vice-versa or it grabs whatever the heck it feels like.. I'm not a big fan of this, i find myself pressing A to open the inventory and i take a weapon out from there instead but in the heat of battle that can be a little too slow.

I don't know if it's just me getting this issue, maybe the dev is aware i dunno but i still sing massive praise for this game, great job creating it and for me it's money well spent as i can see plenty of replay value here. many thanks.","Oct 24, 2019 at 8:19 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 18:33:18.321335,ParadiseDecay,A 'Must Have' VR title for 2019!,"My Quick Thoughts:
*(08/07/2019) - I'm pleased to say the developers have gone above and beyond to fix the issues I mentioned in my original 1st Impressions Video (Below). My main gripe was the combat mechanics, but this feels great now. Well done developers! - I now consider this game to be one of 2019's 'must have' VR titles!

A recent 'Lets Play' of the whole game in it's current state:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuNdH96lrZw

My Original 1st Impressions + Video Link
This early access dungeon crawler has all the hallmarks for a classic VR game, I loved the art style, the exploration, the worlds and the lore, but not a huge fan of the combat which I think needs some more work. There was no haptic feedback from the weapons and at times I didn't feel like I was hitting the enemies.
Don't get me wrong the concept of the combat is great, I just found the execution a little bit lackluster compared to other melee VR games I've played recently like Gorn, Shadow Legend and Blade & Sorcery.

2022-05-28 18:33:18.336295,drash,Very glad I took a leap on this!,"When I bought this there were no reviews yet, but I had a really good feeling about it.  Happily I have been rewarded with a fantastic experience!  Action RPG dungeon crawler with gorgeous visuals, wonderful combat physics, thoughtful control scheme(s) and options, and clearly the developer knows what works in VR.   Thank you for making the kind of game I have been looking for!  I personally have been playing with full smooth movement and turning and it is glorious.

As for feedback:  
1. It took me some time to figure out that the over-the-shoulder inventory grab/storing is done by basically positioning the hand in a fairly specific spot on either side of my neck.   Now that I've stumbled on that I'm good to go, but I can see this confusing players in general.
2. I grabbed a key from a skeleton's mouth and dropped it in fright when it came to life, and after the fight was over it was probably a stroke of luck that I could barely see where the key had gone almost under the stone box that the skeleton came out of.  Again, no problem here personally, but I wonder what happens if a key item is forever hidden somewhere?

Thanks!","May 8, 2019 at 2:46 PM",5, 32,

2022-05-28 18:33:21.474901,taquitobuddy,"Huge potential, no content or challenge","This one was tough to review, has basically one big pro and one big con.

Pros:
-Fantastic feeling, physics based combat system for melee (archery is fine too, but there's dozens of games that do VR achery fine)

Cons:
-Not much of a game to go along with the great melee combat.  The campaign takes 1-2 hours to complete and that's not even rushing.  The arena is fun for another half hour, but because it has no real progression or options it quickly gets boring.  Also both the campaign and arena are very easy.

To wrap it up, because of the extreme lack of content this is really only a 2 star game, but I gave it a bonus star for the impressive melee combat in the hopes that one day this will be a full game.  I know it is in Early Access and still being updated, but honestly I doubt if this will ever get enough content to be really great (would need at least 10x the total current content).","May 23, 2019 at 3:42 PM",3, 11,
2022-05-28 18:33:21.489860,GracelessLiar,,"Wow, this may be the smoothest, best looking VR game I've ever played. The tracking was spot on, even with my measly two sensor set up and small play space. I could even bend down and pick things up off the floor (well most things, I lost the key that another reviewer mentioned having trouble with, but that wasn't the tracking's fault) which I'm almost never able to do. Inventory is great, having the shoulder inventory for quick access is great, and a nice use of VR control. A little sad I can't read or open all the books I keep finding, but over all great dungeon exploring.

Also, after exploring the dungeon, I went out into the town and sat down on my floor under a VR tree and pretended I was in real medieval town. 10/10 would sit again.","May 9, 2019 at 4:40 PM",5, 7,

The only real issue I have currently is I have no idea how to equip the unlockable items in the town hall. Is there something I'm missing? I've tried pressing the equip button but it either doesn't work or I'm not pressing it right. Or maybe that feature isn't in the game yet? Same with the shops outside, although the ""coming soon"" signs tell me they aren't ready yet.

Anyway, Loving it, can't wait for more features and improvements over time!","Jun 12, 2019 at 11:16 AM",4, 4,"Hi Eric Rose thanks for the review and I'm glad your're enjoying it so far. To answer your question, both the shop and the armoury use the same system for equipping. Once you've picked the item up, you need to click the button labelled 'Equip' or ""Buy"". It then spawns into your hand as an equipped item. The 'In Development' label on the shops refers to the prices and items as they are not yet finalised.

2022-05-28 18:33:21.522773,jim1709,"Incredible Potential, Worth every penny","Updated Review: Having finished the game in about 2-3 hours I most firstly say to anyone who is reading this... the game isnt finished yet! And that doesnt mean not polished and stuff like that, which will hopefully happen at some point as well, but what I mean is that the others are saying it lasts 2 hours or 3 tops because the campaing has not had an end yet. So there is definitely more coming  in the future. If I had to pick out something that felt off about the whole experience was the health (and the healing items). After having multiple fights I can safely say that I never died in this game. And not because im some kind of pro but because you cant die. What I mean is that you have put in a system for regaining health with healing items but you also added healing over time (about 2-3 secs to go back to full!). That renders the healing items completely useless since I can just back out for 2 secs and suddenly im ready to fight. There also is no health bar which means that the description ""This item heals 400hp"" means nothing to me because I dont know what my max hp is or when I need to use it. Exept from that just some polishing around how the hands act around doors and other small stuff like that and the game will become perfect. I cant suggest anything for future stages and clearly dont need to since you have done an excellent job with that yourself (Those minibosses when near the end were so much fun to fight hope we see more of the same kind again). Regardless of the above ""little things"" I highly suggest this game to everyone reading this. It is well worth its money and more content is on its way so come help the devs out with some support!

I've also started speedrunning this game (My best time is 12:36 mins!): I suggest others try this as well its really fun and enjoyable.

Update Update: Nvm going to fast in this game straight up breaks it. Items dont drop, doors dont open, cant pick up emblems and stuff like that so instead just take your time","Jun 11, 2019 at 11:07 PM",5, 2,"Hi Jim, thanks for the review. Really glad you are enjoying the game. I wanted to get this out into Early Access so that I could get some feedback like this.

Imagine the combat of Gorn crossed with a Zelda-like dungeon experience and you'll have a pretty good sense of what this is about. The art and animation is well stylized, the combat is top-notch, and performance is great.

2022-05-28 18:33:24.648413,Hanover,"Great idea, still underbaked.","The first issue I had with this game is simply selecting a menu option.  Please devs, just get rid of the 'fancy floaty VR menu"" and give us a static menu?  It took me FOUR TRIES to get to the options menu.  It doesn't even highlight when you point at it with your finger.  

Second of all, I ended up getting stuck in the town.  I guess I got too close to a door and suddenly I couldn't teleport out or move away.  Of course I lost all my progress because I didn't know I had to do a manual save, and my auto save was at the very beginning before I even did the training.

This is game has a great idea, and I can't wait to see what it's like when it's finished, but when you can't even select a menu option because of how inaccurate it is, that tells you just how early access this game really is.  I'm requesting a refund, but I'll be back when its version 1.0.","Jun 9, 2019 at 7:44 AM",2, 0,"Hi Hanover thanks for the feedback. Adding a highlight is a great idea to make it clearer where the interaction areas are on the menu.

The text aligns with your index finger for selection currently, and the hand changes to a point animation.

There is an autosave for each main level and guild area. The town might have been missed (I'll check that). I'll take another pass over the town as well to check for collision issues."

The game plays very well, you can tell a lot of thought has gone into the level design and the combat system. Yes you can tell its unfinished but what there is shows so much potential. Worth £15? in comparison to other games out there, its worth every penny.  

Improvements

Would be nice to have a DOT added or showing when a lit arrow is used. 

I would like to see limited ammo for the bow in areas where the bow is optional. I found it too easy to kill with the bow and a limit would force me to use a hand to hand weapon to save ammo.

Interactions and puzzles are great, and the level design is well thought through. I'm surprised that this is ""Early Access"" to be honest... some ""finished"" games are nowhere near as much fun!

2022-05-28 18:33:27.812950,Nimarus,Very good for an early access title.,"The Morrigan, based on the Celtic mythology of Morrigan, one of the triple Goddesses in Celtic mythology. She represents the circle of life and was associated with both birth and death. There is a lot of stories about Morrigan and you should check them out.

This game, like almost all VR titles, is kind of short. However, it's early access and the developers have stated that they intend to add more to the game.

Attention: game expects you to be standing during gameplay. Otherwise, you're going to feel short compared to other characters you see. I've also read that those with accessibility issues have encountered difficulties while playing. Such as not being able to pick dropped objects from the ground.

Movement: You can walk around like other games and has the standard 45 degree turning to minimize motion sickness. However, there are options to change turning to what you prefer.

Combat: Combat is fun and engaging. You start with your basic sword that you find in a dungeon. Good damage for slashing and stabbing. Axes deal no stabbing damage, but deal more slashing damage. The weapon type effects how you deal damage, so keep that in mind. Fighting feels authentic in some ways. You can't hold your hand out and wiggle the controller to deal massive damage very quickly. There is a break between damage that would be expected if your actually swinging your weapon. So, swing it like it's a real sword. Locations you strike recieve more damage depending on where you strike and if there is armor protecting it. Thus, you'll deal more damage to a skeleton's bare skull than one with a helmet.

Environment: All the environments look great considering the art style the game is aiming for. Each level changes things up a little. One minute your climbing a wall of vines inside a dark dungeon. The next, your walking around outside in a courtyard maze with occasional skeletons animated themselves to attack you.

It may be short for now, but it is fun for what it is now.","May 17, 2019 at 3:49 PM",5, 2,Thanks for the review and feedback. The latest update adds options to set your height if you are sitting and also adds a grab projection system to make it easier to pick things up from the floor.
