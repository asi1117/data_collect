2022-05-28 18:24:09.585492,raph81,Get too difficult too fast,"Really had fun for the first few levels, then at maybe level 5 I suddenly have to touch tiny rotating targets and shoot trophies stuck on narrow shelves with a freaking beach ball? Seriously frustrating.","Nov 25, 2017 at 1:46 AM",2, 0,

I've never been a football fan every since my father drag me to football matches and even brought me season tickets. But I have found a new found love in VR Footaball experiences. I really enjoyed Headmaster which gave me a cool Portal vibe and now this one which throws zombies into the mix. - Awesome stuff!","Sep 20, 2017 at 1:28 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:24:12.774960,SlashSteel,Oculus Touch now supported :),"Thank you for Oculus Touch support, now it's better !
Would be great to add French language / voices...(5 stars if you add this !)
For now, no great interest, need to play more..
Physics are good, level is a bit hard","Sep 27, 2017 at 9:19 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:24:12.791915,AlexanderVR,Nice football game!,"If you like football, you're surely like this header game. It feels really like heading the ball and getting it into the goal. 
This game gives you alot of fun for a small price.","Apr 28, 2017 at 4:45 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:24:12.807872,Heaney-555,Almost perfect,"Very polished and fun experience! My suggestion would be to use floor-level tracking instead of eye-level, and just remind the player to stand up at the start. That way, you don't need the calibration and the floor height is perfect.","Mar 16, 2017 at 11:30 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:24:12.823830,mrleelee123,Very surprising,"I was browsing the store looking for something new to do, to pass the time before Touch launches, saw this and thought ""£7... why not"". I honestly wasn't expecting much at all... Wow, I was wrong! This game is so much fun! You're actually heading a ball, it feels so natural! If you're considering it, buy it! You won't be disappointed!","Nov 30, 2016 at 3:20 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:24:15.923539,Philbert311,Perfect simulation,i always sucked at soccer. and i totally suck at this game. thats how great a simualtion it is. enjoyed loosing the second stage for hours!,"Nov 20, 2016 at 7:33 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:24:15.938499,Tankz,Unexpected fun!,"Great little game, very clever use of the lack of touch controllers for a new way to control in VR, hoping we see more imaganitive games like this!","Nov 30, 2016 at 4:33 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:24:15.953459,AdamNaglich,Surprisingly great.,Wasn't expecting it to be this fun or accurate. I keep wanting to kick the ball. Side note: how does Axel leave his apartment if it doesn't have a door?,"Nov 20, 2016 at 1:50 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:24:15.968419,Luna-NY,,First game in awhile that makes you smile when playing.,"Dec 4, 2016 at 4:13 AM",5, 2,
