2022-05-28 15:32:22.851718,skyhawk43,It was on my quest and it disappeared,Had this game on my quest 2. Played it once and now there is no trace of it. Went on the phone app and bought it again and it refuses to find my headset to install. Just says can't find headset.,Dec 25 at 11:37 PM,1, 4,
2022-05-28 15:32:22.865680,Dejvrecord,on quest 2 via Airlink missing sound,i just got a wrench for quest 2 i play via airlink and i can't hear the sound in that game. Does anyone have the same problem?,May 1 at 7:58 PM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:32:22.880640,karben40,Very good,"Hi I just got this game. It is excellent by the way well worth the money. Question for the Devs though, do you plan to make it stand alone for the quest 2 in the future. Oculus air doesn't work great for me as my internet isn't great and  running oculus link is also a pain. That being said it is a really well made game",Oct 28 at 6:58 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:32:22.894603,TheLegendaryDuv123,Incredibly Accurate Mechanic Sim,"This game will probably only appeal to some people, but you will probably know if you want to get it by looking at it.

If you are considering it is brilliant and the devs are active and responsive in their discord server and update the game well and in good time.

I was amazed at the detail that was put into everything, with complete engine rebuilds possible and rewarding and detailed. Not only this but the ability to simulate racing with the car you tune/build is a great sign of things to come despite it's early stage of development.

I could not recommend this game enough","May 1, 2021 at 10:48 PM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 15:32:26.023235,Johnsel,Best VR game ever,"I am completely in love with this VR game. It is both an educational and highly entertaining game that will keep you coming back to play car mechanic. If you have ever wanted to fully understand car engines and work on them this is your chance to do so, and without oil and grime on your hands that won't wash off!
Even in EA this game is the pinnacle of VR technology with both DLSS and Ray Tracing support. It is probably one of the best looking games and I look forward to seeing how they will build out this game with more content. The only downside is you need a pretty hefty system to enjoy all the eye candy. Otherwise 10/10.","May 29, 2021 at 7:07 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:32:26.039192,Mixup221,Might not be for everyone,"I really enjoy playing this game but it might not be for everyone. Its very detailed so if you like cars and want to learn more about how they work, then you will like playing this. A lot of the gameplay is quite monotenous though and consists of, waiting for fluids to drain/fill, screwing and unscrewing a bunch of screws, and walking back and forth to grab different tools in your shop. I personally find this quite relaxing but you might find it boring. The game is pretty polished at the moment for what it is, but its clear the devs still have a lot of things they want to add.","Apr 10, 2021 at 4:32 PM",5, 11,

Keep coming out with more to maintain and service. This is great at show using air tools and the importance of torque wrenches. My only complaint is that the tablet can be difficult to read, but you get used to where things are over time. Thank you for the great product. Please keep up the great work.","Mar 18, 2020 at 11:17 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 15:32:29.232651,alphetto.filmmaker,Good ! But Motorcycle ?,"Very interesting !

I've always wanted to learn how to take a car apart, and now I have the chance!

It would be nice to have a mechanical part of the motorcycles (Harley Davidson), I bought the software and I give my full support!

An Italian translation would also be nice!

Thank you","Mar 19, 2020 at 5:13 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:32:29.247611,deejay.dazza,Freakin Awesome,"dont usually leave reviews, but having just purchased my Rift S, this is what VR was made for, still on the tutorial, feels like i have spent a night in the garage I dont own!

tinkering with an engine without getting cold and dirty, looking forward to hours of fun, can now dream of this having a motorbike add on/alternative, this is more than a game, this is Virtual Reality!!!! - well done","Mar 3, 2020 at 8:23 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:32:32.333359,rawdmon,Shop class in VR,"I know a little bit about cars but I've always wanted to learn more and I was blown away by this.  It's literally like shop class in VR, it's very impressive and the design is quite good.  The only comment I would make (and the only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars) is that some of the parts of the tutorials are pretty vague.  You need to do something in a very specific way and sometimes the explanations aren't too detailed.  For instance when you're putting bolts in to the top of the engine in the third tutorial I think it is, and you need to alternate between bolts in a pattern while tightening them to 76Nm or something like that (I'm going off memory here).  It doesn't say anything about how I tell whether they are tightened enough, if there are any special techniques needed.  Can I put all the bolts in ahead of time or do I have to insert them one at a time as well to complete the tutorial successfully?  I ended up just ending the tutorial but I'll go back to it and try to figure it out later.  Some sort of practical walkthrough of what's expected would be useful for people if they get stuck.  Otherwise, fantastic simulator that I'm sure I'll be spending a lot of time in.","Nov 26, 2019 at 2:46 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 15:32:32.349315,bobolink111,Spark plugs,"I love parts of this simulator and it's great watching my 12 year old play this over and over. I play on it as well.  What I don't understand is why you can't change the spark plugs. No matter what wrench i grab it won't let me take them off. So I figure maybe I can just keep removing things from the engine to get to them. Nope. So i look for any instruction. Can't find any. So please, tell me what I need to do. Or what am I missing. I know how to change spark plugs in real life. So please tell me how to find help in this game that relates to issues playing so I can easily see if it's a glitch or something I need to learn so I don't spend hours just looking for answers","Oct 27, 2019 at 12:06 AM",2, 10,"Hello,
You need to use a socket extension to reach the spark plugs. In VR extensions are toggled through the context menu (A or X key)"

2022-05-28 15:32:32.379235,Redlightning7777,,"This has got to be the best mechanic simulator I have *EVER* played.   I have not touched Car Mechanic Simulator in any of its flavors since. 

This is how it should be done.. with tons more to come, according to the roadmap. 

These guys have not slowed down since I purchased this Early Access title a while back.   If you LOVE being a mechanic this is the game for you.  Certainly NOT an arcade title.","Oct 25, 2019 at 11:34 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:32:32.393198,Master_Mold,Wrench Review,"This program is good to play, has great ongoing potential and is very well made. I appreciate the development team's responsiveness to problems and continued improvement of the game. From a learning perspective it would be good to see some electronics simulated and purhaps modern electronic testing equipment. Also, a 'hint/cheat' as to the cause of a problem would be handy :-)","Sep 26, 2019 at 2:40 AM",4, 3,Thanks for the review. We pushed a hotfix last night that should resolve all of the part bugs related to the physics change.
2022-05-28 15:32:35.506871,Tengu_Fighter,One of my new favourites!,"This is more than a game, its inspiring and educational too. I've always been into engines but it is a dark art that unless you have a go or someone teaches you, its hard to get the courage to do it yourself. Inspiring in the sense it has made me want to pick up my tools and get more adventurous. Educational, as these are real life engines and I'm learning some good basics. I'm really looking forward to any future advanced engineering tutorials this team releases.","Jun 18, 2019 at 6:21 PM",5, 26,
2022-05-28 15:32:35.520833,xgoldxbox,Keep it up guys! I mean it!,"I tried the demo version of this game, and it absolutely fulfilled my expectations. This is a great example of what VR is capable of in certain fields. Entertaining and educating people at the same time. I put this on my wishlist, and was waiting for a discount, but then I played it again and realized, this is not even a steep price for the content, plus I have to support these guys! Everyone should support developers like them who deliver this quality on VR today. Well done so far, and I hope you really keep implementing new parts, mechanics, machines, etc into it. I would even pay for DLC packs, just keep up the good work!","Jul 19, 2019 at 12:55 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:32:35.535792,JDBurnZ,"This ""game"" blows my mind.","Best feature of all: If the engine blows, you're not out a real $2,000!

I played the demo, and my mind was blown. Why? Because I have a DOHC inline-4 sitting in my garage just waiting to be rebuilt, but have never mustered up the courage due to a fundamental lack of experience - UNTIL NOW! The engine in the demo was nearly identical to the motor I'm rebuilding - it was so encouraging (and fascinating) to visually inspect every part and see how each and every piece fits together, and in which order! So many times I had to take that darn oil pan off again! I finally learned to just put that on last. >_<

Now I'm playing the game, and I'll be sure to give my thoughts when I'm ready. For now, 5 stars because I want this to succeed - You could literally change the education system and the way people learn with this sort of approach to problem solving.","Apr 24, 2019 at 1:01 PM",5, 32,
2022-05-28 15:32:35.550752,BertAudios,Exceptional Work,"I have long been a fan of the Mazda Miata. The entire vehical since its introduction has been a platform for some of the most impressive custom builds I have ever seen or drive.
Being a builder and owner of 3 Exomotive Exocets I will say hands down this is BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE BEST LEARNING TOOL FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD A MIATA OR EXOCET.

The detail has left me speechless. Yes the controls are slighly odd and I would give the control setup a 90%. But it is still an exceptional piece of gaming and for a first release it surpasses nearly 90% of all the other VR titles to date with not having bugs or any issues that I could find.

I expect great things from this studio going forward.

Excelent work development team.","Mar 14, 2019 at 7:34 PM",5, 49,
2022-05-28 15:32:35.565712,B-B-Bronsky,Wow!,"It's a pleasure to play this game, really complete and all, must have for people wanting to build stuff in general.

However: Sometimes I'm just lost... Like ""Why it isn't working"" or just ""How the F* am i supposed to do that"" because sometimes it's not explained (or I didn't found it). I mean not knowing how to go further sometimes must be the biggest problem of this game (And i'm not sure I really want to go and see how to change brakefluid on a real car on ytb in order to play this game). The controls are a littler wanky at the start, and the walking speed is just TOO SLOW, the robotic voice is more or less killing me, I HATE IT... But to be honest those are not big problems... 

Feel free to put some music when you're playing because there's almost no sound and sometimes changing a tire can seem a bit bland.","Mar 18, 2019 at 10:51 PM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 15:32:38.676392,MrPianoman38,After a patch it should be perfect,"Firstly, I really want to express how much I want this game to succeed. You've done an awesome job at really cramming in every detail, while still having it be a fun experience to people just interested in learning how it all works from the ground up. If you've even remotely interested in building things or you liked legos as a kid, this is like the ""how to build a car from absolutely scrath for dummies with a bit of patience and basic problem solving skills"".

However, I was using the part collector (trigger) and the parts seem to get stuck and become un-grabbable after the fact. There's some other small bugs that can be a bit frustrating, especially since I'm not finished with the tutorial yet, but hopefully you'll get around to fixing this stuff soon.

Other than the (mostly) small bugs, it really is an incredible game! I just want to be able to finish the tutorial :'(","Mar 20, 2019 at 2:00 PM",3, 7,

When i played the demo and relized this game hadnt been released yet i was extreamly sad and have been waiting for it to drop since.

I skipped through the tetorial because I traid the Demo vertion and already new the stuff in the demo. When in the shop I am just sitting there and can not fugure out how to get a car to work on. 
Giving it a two star until I get a respnse ane can get into game, then maybe give more stars.

Update: conclusion was that it did not want to start unless I finished tutorial of engine build after I stat it. I just skipped doing it, since I already new.","Mar 18, 2019 at 4:57 AM",4, 4,
