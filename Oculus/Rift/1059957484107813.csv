2022-05-28 19:51:19.052739,FastLawyer,"Good concept, poor execution","This game is really not that good.  It really should be a two star game.  I'm only giving it three because I like the idea and because of the low price.  I would love to control a motorcyle in VR and control it with my motion controllers like I have my hands on the handlebars.  I want to go fast and do things on the roadway I couldn't do in real life.  I want to feel the rush that you get when you're speeding down the highway while I turn up the radio.  However, that VR game does not exist.  This game looks like it might be that game from the store page, but it's not even close to it.  Yes, you do get to control a bike with the motion controllers as hands on the handlebars.  You do steer and put on speed this way.  But it's not a racing game.  It's an avoiding kamikazes running at you the opposite way.  It's closer to 
Frogger than a racing game.  Sometimes you can't even see the kamikazes from all the debris around you.  Worst, there's very little sense of speed.  The graphics are just that poor overall.  Only when you hit nitro do you ever feel like you're going fast.  It just feels like you're on rails most of the time.  The vehicles look like boxes most of the time.  The debris are coins you collect, but the visuals are so poor you can't even tell what you're collecting.  The scale of your cockpit view on the bike is way off.  The physics are all wrong.  For some unknown reason, you have to hold grip and touch on both controllers to get going (bug?).  I didn't notice any difference from the different bikes you can unlock.  At least the tracks look different, even if they are all pretty bad.  Collisions don't even look or feel right.  Why am I giving this 3 stars again?  Oh yeah, I like the idea.  Good idea, bad execution.  Some good dev out there, please get this type of game right.  I will throw money at you.  Please.","Jan 13, 2018 at 2:51 PM",3, 10,
