I am getting more and more toxic people making gestures and behaving poorly and there is nothing you can do except forfeit the game. The game itself is great but there are a few bad apples who are sore losers and ruin the experience. The most frustrating thing is that they can get ""revenge"" by just putting their headset down and leaving you waiting or having to forfeit the match. There needs to be an option to abandon the match if someone is idle for more than 30 seconds",Dec 11 at 8:08 PM,3, 96,"update 12/24:

hi curious_llama. In ranked play, there is a shotclock. Did you disable it? Check it in the menu next time you are in a ranked match.

2022-05-28 12:40:29.694542,o0steve0o,Closest to a real ping pong game,"If you want to play ping pong without having the space or the urge of putting a actual ping pong table, this is defenitly the way to go !
The gameplay is truly realistic and also the AI is great to play against.

Some notes to the developers:
-A tournament option would be nice.

-The physcis of how the ball behaves on the table itself and the directions of hitting it and giving it spin a re spot on I think, however 2 things I noticed:
1) When the ball bounces on the floor it's nowhere as realistic as it should be: try it in real life... it should keep bouncing a loooooot more. (I'm sure everyone, who has played ping pong once in real life, remembers where they had to run like crazy, at least once, to get that ball stopping :-D)

2) When performing a ""smash"", you don't seem to be able to transfer that full power potential to the ball. As you know, the ball is empty inside but the plastic shell is quite hard so you can give it a lot of power when smashing and this is a bit less I think.

Nevertheless, and all things considered, you did an amazing job !",Jan 5 at 9:00 PM,4, 14,"hi o0steve0o. Would love to chat more with about this. Can you hop onto the discord or facebook chats? Links found here: https://linktr.ee/elevenvr

2022-05-28 12:40:29.741923,FR4NCIS.QC,Very good game but not perfect !,"I love this game on my quest 2, I can play it for hours and hours but it is not perfect and here is why,

- first : I find the table a bit too small in length and width compared to a real table in real life, I know it's a game but I think having a slightly bigger table would make the game even better more realistic and more powerful strikes would have a better chance to stay on the table and give players more playability.

- second : you should really create other environments because only 3 is not enough and having environments like those offered in quest 2 would be too great and would be a good idea to help you create or take those there if you can.

- third : to have more choices of rackets in terms of models or choice of colors. This is not a necessity as you don't really notice the racket when you play but it could be a pretty cool option and add some content to the game which in my opinion could be badly needed.

So here are three really awesome ideas that would make this game even more awesome and I believe that all other players like me who start playing or have been playing it for a long time will totally agree and in my opinion would become the ultimate ping pong game that we all must absolutely have.
Thank you !",Sep 5 at 11:59 PM,5, 56,"hi FR4NCIS.QC. Thanks for the review and the suggestions. As far as table size, it is 99.9% or so within actual table dimensions. If the table looks too small, or too large, that is most likely a sign that you are setting the headset FOV to a value that doesn't match your own eyes. Many people end up doing this by accident because the image is clear enough. For many of those people, the range at which the image is clear is actually larger than they may suspect. Anyway, once you set up the FOV to match your real eyes, it should appear correctly sized to you. 
Many players have lined up a real table with the in game table for fun and it does line up very well. 

As far as the other suggestions, all of that and much more is in the works! :)

In some cases, the game is more realistic, such as rally. But when I got 1900 points, I found a serious problem: Many people about 1900 only serve long topspin to expect that you can't react. I've never encountered such a effective serve in reality.Then I conducted a service test myself. I found that it was easy to make a long topspin of 10m / s, but in reality, such a service was not so threatening, including professional games. I don't know whether it was due to the lack of body movement or the physical problems of the service. Now I surrender when I encounter a long, topspin fastball player.

The devs have done a great job building an immersive world where you truly feel like you are playing ping pong. The physics are also great, and the haptics really make it feel like you’re hitting the ball. The main thing I’ve had difficulty with are slams. But that could be a tracking issue with the touch controllers and not the app itself. 

All in all, I cannot recommend this more highly if you at all enjoy playing ping pong. I’m actually considering buying a second headset for my dad (who is 1800 miles away) so we can play together as I’ve not been able to visit home this year due to COVID.","Jan 3, 2021 at 8:00 AM",5, 65,

2022-05-28 12:40:45.554411,sH1n,It's pretty much what you hope to expect,"TLDR: Get naked and have some fun table tennis excercise!

If you can't play table tennis, because corona, buy this and you have something to scratch that itch and actually get some excercise. The physic engine is pretty good, the ball is actually behaving as I'm anticipating. Spin works great.

It only reaches it's limits when the bounds of soft and hardware are met. A fast rally is really hard to control, since everything has some lag in the miliseconds. It's still fun, but you won't be able to consistently loop balls with a human.

It get's worse when the internet connection isn't perfect. Ball seems already out, but suddenly the opponents paddle teleports and still hits the ball, without giving you anything to anticipate this.

UI is already getting better, but still not the most intuitive. This won't stop you from playing till you sweat!","Dec 16, 2020 at 2:01 AM",5, 2,"hi sH1n, have you tried the ping compensation options?

original response:::
hello Nitemare2123. The dev(me) did put a simple setting to disable these rules. At least many of them. strict serving rules are enabled only for ranked online matches, or if you manually enable them against the AI. 
If you are complaining about not being allowed to serve over the table...that's cornerstone of the sport...but maybe you aren't talking about this?

Depends on your skill level... I am exactly as good in Eleven as I am in real life, which is to say not very good, lol! Something like Racket Fury adds just enough of an ""arcade"" feel that you can still have fun even if you suck at table tennis. I'd say if you just want fun smacking balls back and forth, Racket Fury is the better option, but if you want a true ping pong simulator, Eleven is absolutely the better option.

This is just fab and runs as smooth as silk on the Quest 2 with the Quest version. I was playing and chatting with a girl from Berlin this morning, it was fluid, clear and great fun and took me back to my late teens as I used to play with my Uncle for the hospital team.

I really am terrible at table tennis and so is my girlfriend. But by playing together on our new virtual table, we have both been able to dramatically improve. I just beat the computer on medium for the first time (she is at work). The feeling I got from that rather hard fought victory prompted this review. I can not see anything they didn't do perfectly here. This truly is a perfect simulation. Any experience could have a little more icing (environments, choose your own background music, etc.). There probably is much more I haven't seen here. But the full cake is here. Eat this thing. If table tennis interests you at all, buy this thing now.... it is actually better than the real thing.

2022-05-28 12:41:01.342287,Thyphoon,Recent Update Ruined Game,"For over a year, I loved this game.  Table Tennis was very realistic, and playing it was a joy.  However, I recently received an upgrade (now runinning version 2.131.1), and the game is completely changed for the worse.  Backgrounds are changed, and methods to adjust table position (in three dimensions) are completely different.  No longer can you grab and move the table, but now you have to touch the ""floor"" so the program can set the height it wants.  Worst of all, the program causes a complete failure to the point that my (powerful) computer reboots on its own.  What a mess!!!  How could the developer take a great game and ""impreve"" it to the point that it won't even run.  SHAME!  If you haven't bought this program, DON'T.  Wait until major bugs have been identified and fixed.  If you are over age 35, you may not live long enough.  I am going to remove this (formally great) game from my system.  It is very sad for me.
UPDATE 5/24/2020
Kudos to developer who responded so quickly.  Based on his suggestions, I made the table adjustment as he described and it was successful.  I also was unable to duplicate the performance problems I had yesterday, but they were not present today.  I probably should have cooled down yesterday and given things another day before writing my initial review.  The game plays well so I updated my star rating to 5.","May 25, 2020 at 9:49 AM",5, 44,

I'd love to see more environments.  This is partly the point of VR.  Why only two that are fairly boring?  The game would be greatly improved if there were considerably more environment options.  I'd even love a mostly black environment so table and ball really stand out

The AI is great.  I prefer this to multiplayer due to the latency / ping.  It would be great if there were some single player game modes or tournaments.  I usually make them up myself.  Here's some suggestions:

Marathon Mode.  Select a starting difficulty and # of games per match.  If you win, you play a +5 harder opponent.  If you loose, you go down 5 for next match.  Play indefinitely or until beat 100 (I've only beat an 80).

Tournament Mode. Play increasingly tough opponents.  You loose a match, you're out.

2022-05-28 12:41:07.717450,kenjam,Fantastically Real,"What an amazingly real replication of table tennis this game is. It has literally had me cursing & sweating whilst trying to beat the AI at the various difficulty settings. Honestly it really is about as close to the real thing as you can get. Somehow I've managed to avoid running into any real life objects whilst lunging to retrieve an acutely angled shot from my opponent! I'm interested to see if this game does translate into being able to play real life table tennis at a reasonable standard.

I would like to see some sort of single player career mode added with playing environments that become bigger & better as you improve up the rankings. There are plenty of good examples on consoles etc. that have made a pretty good job of this. That would add further depth & enhance the whole experience by having crowd noise, improved & varied surroundings, score calling, AI opponents with varying skills etc.. Just the ability to play in different environments actually would take this game up a notch for me. Also it would be nice to see a proper human representation of your opponent moving & playing, which again would add to the overall realism & experience instead of the floating blue Elvisy torso at the other end of the table.

For me there are aspects that could take this game onto a whole other level to make this a truly immersive experience that would no doubt keep me playing for hours at a time, it feels as though there are lots of add ons that could be instroduced that would take this from 3D to 4D... BUT make no mistake, the gameplay is already supremely real & for that I applaud the developers because that alone is fantastic!

Still the very best VR experience, if you want realism.  One of the few video games aside from sim racing that can make you better in real life.  Yes it's that accurate.

Still a way to go on the AI but the possibility to program the ball machine is great and allows you to create a set of drills to your preference, a great improvement, even if the realism of the interface of the ball machine in the old version was nice and nostalgic.

I still feel something is lost here in terms of reach out and touch usability, but feature wise it's a great change.

2022-05-28 12:41:10.916520,goesBang,Great simulation,"This is one of my favorite games.

I didn't play for like 15 years - but it feels just very realistic for me (as an amateur).
The great advantage for this kind of simulation is, that the controller with it's haptic feedback is not so far from a table tennis rack (weight) and the  ball hit there - it's conceptually much easies to do than with boxing or tennis.

And the physics is very good! I think it improved with the recent updates - e.g. it was quite difficult and unrealistic to hit the ball very fast from above or with hand flicks (worked in RL) - you really had to play the classic way. High balls where terrible - free win for amateuer games in RL, automatic miss in this simulation ;) It changed and works now

What also changed (yey!) and it was very annoying: I often play against the AI. This thing managed to have like 25% net touches / rolls. It was annoying as hell. It's really reduced now.

I liked the old table positioning more than this new calibration menu, but should be ok. It's great that I can now switch off game requests from other players.

In sum - great simulation, just got better.","Jun 12, 2020 at 3:57 AM",5, 1,"hi goesBang. Thanks for the review. You can enable a positioning system virtually identical to what it was before.

2022-05-28 12:41:14.090176,Plutonium-239,Initially skeptical...then WOW!,"I bought this game because it was on sale. I was expecting to be disappointed but it turned out that it was the first game in ages that made me enjoy multiplayer. All the people I met i could feel like we were friends and enjoyed every single game, even though I lost several times. 

The environments are quite simple and limited: found just the studio and the mountain refuge. Limited choice of avatars as well. It would be good if one could use its own oculus home avatar, or adding a better customisation.

The game itself feels real, no doubt. Haptic feedback is just perfect...makes you believe you are actually hitting the ball. I am not quite sure about the effect of the air friction on the ball though. Doesn't seem to exist...that's probably more difficult to simulate, I guess.

Community looks nice so far. I felt a sort of connection with the other person and genuinely I had fun!

I am giving 4 stars because the game can be improved with further customisation, 
 few tweaks on the physics and has few performance issues (glitches and framerate drops). However I totally recommend it.","May 23, 2020 at 7:26 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 12:41:17.223849,KryptonGorilla,"Fast, Accurate, Realistic and Amazing!","In 30 years of gaming I've never written a review, but this will be the very first. I have to say that this game has totally blown me away in terms of realism and responsiveness; and that the Developer support is second to none. Below are just a few of the reasons why I fully support the game and the people making it.

1. The first day I purchased the game I logged in at 10PM at night just to see what it's all about. I didn't plan on going further than 5 minutes. I played a bot game, got wrecked, figured I was rusty. Kept getting wrecked. Apparently super rusty, cough.

2. Notification received: Person wants to join your game. Yeah, OK, why not? I have to be better than a person. Robots are like, really good at games.

3. Person joins and...what's that...I can hear them talking. Oh, they can hear me talking back. OK, this can go either way, it's the internet. 

4. Proceeds to spend the next 2 hours learning about the game, laughing at one another, talking about travels and adventures and how the top spin is so amazing. We change background areas four times. Each time I think I'll be so much better in a new setting. I'm not, I continue to get destroyed. But I get better and better (mostly) as we go.

5. My guest is awesome. I haven't had this much fun gaming with anyone, especially a stranger, in forever. We talk about museums. Play a round. Discuss how responsive and accurate things are. Play a round. Test all kinds of trick shots and silly movements. Play a round. He's gracious and courteous and fun and the game seems like we're in my garage and we've been doing this every weekend for the last 10 years. It's...everything you want in a game.

Gaming is different for everyone. VR experiences can vary widely. But this is a game that *can* be truly exceptional if you remember it's just Ping Pong and it's OK to be bad and have a great time.

Developers even helped me track my new friend down for more games in the future. 10/10. Would lose again and love it.","Jan 31, 2020 at 10:31 PM",5, 146,

2022-05-28 12:41:39.382004,taquitobuddy,Great Table Tennis Sim,"Pros:
-Realistic Table Tennis Sim
-Simple but functional with all the necessary options
-When both players have a good connection and low ping, multiplayer works great

Cons:
-The AI bots are decent quality, but don't react realistically to many things (like spin).  They are great for practice, but you'd never confuse one of the bots with a real player so unless you are brand new to table tennis the bots alone won't be much fun.
-The quality of multiplayer is extremely dependent on both players having good specs, high quality connection, and low ping.  Multiplayer works perfectly in this case, but unfortunately there's just not enough people playing to consistently have opponents like this, and if you play during non-primetime hours, forget about it.  I just checked and there are exactly 2 people on right now - one is AFK and the other has a single red bar connection (unplayable).

Bottom line: If you have a friend(s) you know will be playing this to, it is easily a 5-star must-have VR game.  Otherwise, as the AI's just aren't good enough (in terms of realistic play) to substitute for actual people, this game is really hit or miss depending on your region and what time you play.","Sep 18, 2019 at 11:47 AM",4, 11,

But with some practice, you can contest the stronger players. As for the A.I singleplayer, the bot difficulty from Professional and onward are very innaccurate in terms of handling spin. You can put so much spin on the ball, and the A.I would send it back casually with nearly no spin on the ball. It makes for frustrating play at times since an experienced online player would have to handle it far more differently. While it is possible with serious effort to beat the bots at high difficulty, it still needs tuning for more realism.

2022-05-28 12:41:52.133836,YoeyYutch,My favorite,"I thought I already did my review. I'm not a ping pong player in real life. I have played but it's been a while.  Officially I've loggged 160+ hours in the game. I play it more than any other game. Beat Saber is th eonly other game that is close. I think what tips the balance in favor of Eleven is the people. Beat Saber has a great community outside of the game and Eleven does too (both on Discord) but I really enjoy interacting with people while playing Eleven.  You can choose to have your microphone on or off and also choose whether you want to hear what your opponent is saying if they have their mic on. The vast majority of people are really cool and at the very least, not mean or rude. I can only think of one occasion in the past several months that somebody was so obnoxious and rude that I had to mute them. They were just frustrated because they didn't understand how spin works in table tennis. They were essentially projecting their frustration on me, which I can understand to some degree because learing the complexities of spin in table tennis is a long term learning experience. What makes it especially difficult as a beginner is that you have to consciously try to figure out what spin is on the ball, then calculate  how to return the ball in play, let alone hit a good shot. Then you have to actually hit the shot! So in the meantime you have to get yourself in position to hit the ball. Its a lot to do in an very short timespan. It can be rather overwhelming, but rewarding as you start to figure it out. It's still an ongoing learning process that I don't really expect to stop. There are some very skilled players out there.  Playing people who are better than you is key to getting better yourself.  They may be taking it easy on you, but that's ok. I call them ""Game 3 guys"".  I don't let anybody win, but I don't try to crush people either. You should always have to earn it. It feels good to finally get that first win against a tough opponent.","Feb 25, 2019 at 1:57 AM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 12:42:11.214990,b1u3screen,Real spin!! Ma Long would be impressed!,"Real spin that you can legitmately put almost any kind of spin you would put on a real ball. Top spin? Yes! You can put a little or a lot of spin. Back spin side chop? No problem! Pendulum serve? Easy! Ma Long serve? The verdict is still out, I have hard enough time doing it in real life but I think it is possible. The paddle customization is impressive, you can adjust the amount of speed, spin that your paddle's rubber will produce.

But there are areas I would like to see improved/wish list: 
1. For ranked play have the offical rule in place that a ball must rise at least 16cm/~6inches otherwise everyone is just going to resort to cheap shots.
2. The paddle customization is great but it can be so much better! A large majority of good and pro players use 2 different rubbers on the front and back of their paddle. I actually use long PIPs on one side and an inverted rubber on the other not that uncommon. Please add customization for both sides of the paddle!!
3. Long pips phsycis would be really cool to see in a game. Short pips is good but long pips with the spin reveral and various effects it comes with like the knuckleball effect would truly make it complete. I know this one is long shot and would probably be the most difficult to add.

Thanks for leaving a review. There is one minigame where you set a ball machine to any setting you want and hit back and forth. It is best to use this to get a hang of playing the game. Generally speaking, it is very close to 1:1 skill transfer - and table tennis in real life is not easy by any measure. In real life though, you get a lot more information through the paddle than you do through the controller (haptics tech isn't even close yet :) ). This allows you to push the ball back.

2022-05-28 12:42:26.987769,PotatoFairy,Realistic!,"I barely played ping pong in the past, and was always an absolute scrub at it. I bought ETT after hearing how realistic the physics were, and decided to give it a go. It's a really relaxing game when I'm not playing actual matches, and I really enjoy watching TV or Twitch streams when playing. 

I was really surprised, then, when I learned how to smash in-game and successfully smashed on a friend in real life. Although getting a grip is easier IRL, and the paddle is a bit heavier, the motions were exactly the same and the physics were startlingly realistic.

The only thing I'd improve would be performance on lower-end cards: unfortunately, I had to upgrade from a GTX 970 to a GTX 1080 to get consistent performance. I'm not actually sure why this was the case, and it might've been due to a performance patch, but I definitely saw a massive improvement when I upgraded.","Mar 23, 2018 at 6:56 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 12:42:27.024670,Wordsmithery,Much better than I thought it would be,"A few people recomended this to me and I thought; Table Tennis in VR? Really? But yeah, it's actually a cool game, well designed, well layed out, and fun to play.

I now play three games every morning as part of my early morning work out, followed by a session in BoxVR, as Eleven is a great warm up.

Things I liked were the AI, the choice of rooms to play in, the fact that the default New York (or whereever it's supposed to be) appartment is so cool. I love the control systems and the serve mechanic is pretty consistent and very playable. It's also nice the game opens up in Knock about or warm up mode, where I can just play backwards and forwards to get my head in the game.

Things I don't like; the table by default could be moved by the left trigger and I kept accidently moving it. I eventually found the toggle to disable it so the table can only be moved when I am in the menu system. However, I have yet to find a way to stop people from interupting my game with invites to play them. I am probably so bad they all want to play me so they can beat me.

Things I would like; a way to change the music, or perhaps even turn it off. Achievments! I can't beleive this isn't in the game at all. Also a way to make the AI get tired. So after a while he slows down like I do (because I am old).

Otherwise, this is a brilliant VR title that should be in everyones Library.","Apr 5, 2018 at 3:45 PM",4, 8,"Hello Wordsmithery,

2022-05-28 12:42:30.140460,tellmike,Wow!! Surprisingly good!!,"I got this game in the Duo Pack together with ""From Other Suns"", and I must say that this game got me hooked pretty good! Ping pong has always been readily available to me from around school age, and when I was little my parents used to have a ping pong table around so I have spent some hours now and then around the table. I'm not a big fan of ping pong in any way. Mostly think of it as ""Ok"".

But wow, when I started playing this in VR the experience of having access to a table is suprisingly fun. I played some games against the Amature level AI and managed to beat it after about 20 min of gameplay, and then had a game against an human opponent I had a good match with.

One really-really cool feature in the game is the replay function which allows to slow down/speed up/reverse time. I almost feel like a time-traveller with the ability to walk around the table and controling the time with the flick of the joystick. Really darn cool!!

There are some minor bugs though and I'll list them here:

During replay: 
- It seems like pausing/resuming always resets the time to 00:00, 
- Pressing the left the joystick to the left (and right?) also resets time to 00:00.
Selecting apperance: 
- The ""VR helmet"" selection is mixed up with the Cat / Rabbit head in the selection window.
Misc:
- It was pretty annoying when I kept getting notifications from other online players even though I was having a single player match against the AI. I later noticed that it is possible to ""mute"" online requests in the ""Multiplayer"" selection, so that's good at least. Also, I didn't have much luck with finding a way to mute the annoying multiplayer notification sounds. Not an issue if multiplayer is ""muted"" all together.

Nevertheless, this ping pong game is awesome in it's simplicity. I can definitly recommend this title to anyone looking for a fast-to-pickup-hard-to-let-go VR game/experience. -1 star for the small bugs, but really, I'm nitpicking! Thanks dev for making this!","Mar 17, 2018 at 6:59 AM",4, 4,

I've got to say: this is by far one of the most pleasing experiences I've had in VR. The physics are on point, the environments are simple, and the mini-games are great. It is such a relaxing time to just slap some balls around.

The only downside at the moment is that the in-game friends function is ""coming soon"" as is the ranking profile. The lack of the ability to add friends in-game and know when peole are in is a serious drawback, as the multiplayer for this one is probably the finest and easiest VR multiplayer game I've played.

You wouldn't think that a ping pong sim would bring you a feeling of presence in VR, yet it does - it's so easy to get into and start playing that you'll quickly forget you're in VR and just start playing like you would in real life.  I'm not a real life player of table tennis - I quickly tire of chasing the ball down, and in Eleven, this small annoyance doesn't exist!

2022-05-28 12:42:36.573994,HeadlessRoland,,"I was one of those people who never owned a ping pong table, never really had access to one, and thus always hated it when I tried it. That initial learning curve is steep, and not too fun when you're getting your tail handed to you by your friends or chasing the ball all over the garage. Eleven changed everything! Yes, it feels just like ping pong (so real I have fallen down from leaning on the imaginary table), but you never have to chase the ball, and your opponent is always just a little better (plus the taunting doesn't sting so badly coming from an AI).

This is one of my most-played and most-enjoyed VR experiences, and though I've had it for over a year (started playing it on Steam with a Vive, now play in the Rift) I still come back to it. The replayability is nearly endless. It's also super-accessible; everyone I've shown it to has enjoyed it, gaming enthusiasts, kids, technophobes, it just translates the real world experience beautifully.

Finally, the developer is active and responsive. The game is regularly updated, and the developer is quick to respond to questions or requests. I'm pretty sure I would rank this as my number-one most-recommended VR title.

I also couldn't reposition myself as the game instructed without enabling in-game positioning in the settings menu. Why tell the player they can reposition immediately, but not enable it by default?

Finally, this is just my opinion, but the floating mask and paddle is incongruous with a realistic environment and immersion breaking. I wish there was options to turn on the head, torso, hands, arms, forearms, etc.

-1 star for the default settings performance.

Update: Only 1 environment.
Multiplayer had syncing issues that made gameplay difficult.","Mar 18, 2018 at 10:33 AM",4, 2,"Hello, thanks for the review and letting us know about the repositioning - I assume you mean the label says you can, but you can't. This was very very recently changed (like a day ago or so) because too many people didn't know of the setting in the menu, and were inadvertently moving themselves around all of the time. 

Regarding performance - I thought we shipped with default spectator mode off, but I'll make sure next patch turns that off. Recording though is negligible. 
We do want to try implementing inverse kinematics (IK), but it's not very simple. It may end up that the best guess arrangement of body and limbs, leads to a worse experience.

HOWEVER, the constant ""ping"" sound from the notification are annoying, the AI doesn't seem to care about if I put spin on the ball or not. The spin is there and when you play with others it has an effect, but the AI don't care. The difficulty increase on the AI is ridiculous!! Amature AI is nothing after getting used to the controls, I can beat the semi-pro AI abour 75% of the time and I lose 0-11 agains the pro AI (it hurts man...).
In the ""Waves"" minigame the RED things fire when a ball hits the table on their side.

At first, I was awful, virtually unable to hit the ball back over the net or serve. Now, after playing most evening for a week or so I've reached a level of basic competence to where I can routinely beat the computer AI on amatuer level, and have even won a couple of semi pro matches. After venturing on to multiplayer I was trounced at first, but have now won my last three matches, something I would never have thought possible in any ball sport ever invented! I'm no longer the worst player! That for me is a huge achievement in less than a fortnight and I think demonstrates the power of VR to help people improve skills that they avoid in real life due to the pressue of social embarassment.

Because table tennis bats are so light anyway, and because in real life the ball is so light you can't feel its impact, makes this the perfect game for being so life like in VR.

Five stars because five is the closest to 4.6.  It loses 0.4 because when in a match with the AI, you should able to signal the AI player that you are ready for his next serve, maybe with a quick click of a button. In real life this is down to your position at the table, in this game if you glace at the scoreboard or make a quick change to your headset, the serve is still going to come at you. Minor thing really, the game at the price has to be one of the best games you will ever play.","Feb 16, 2018 at 8:35 PM",5, 0,"hmm, good idea.

PP is probably THE ideal game for VR as far as 1:1 immersion and of the three so far I'd say the default physics in Eleven are at the bottom of the stack.  Caveat being that I only have about 20min logged so far to get used to it, and I felt almost the same way about Racket Fury when first trying it, so it ""might"" grow on me down the road somehow.  Compared to the other two PP games it feels like there's no subtlety to how hard you hit returns, either the paddles are made with double-sided sticky tape, or it's flying off somewhere.  Spins are done well but returns just feel off.  I'll give it some time and maybe update the review but I'm a bit skeptical.  Also, noticed some performance issues and hitching I don't get in the more graphically intense Racket Fury so might need some more optimizing.  Got a request to play from someone but accepting it didn't do anything so I'm guessing even MP might need work too.","Feb 9, 2018 at 6:22 AM",3, 1,"Hello ChareL68.

There are some UI updates that need to happen; mute notification, stop dropping a ball everytime I click on something, make it easier to lock the table position, etc. Definitely in my top ten, everyone needs to have this in their library for whenever you are getting burnt out on VR and just want something simple to do for a few minutes/hours.

But Racket Fury has some good points as well.    In this game, I'd like to have the game adjust the TABLE HEIGHT so that it matches the regulation table tennis standard.

From a fully customisable ball-machine practice mode to mini-games, the opportunities to improve your game are rife - put this alongside a high quality single player mode and this game is as good offline as it is online.  The AI does have some flaws (occasionally falls into a routine of specific shots), but by and large does a great job of simulating a real opponent.  The beginner mode is very simple - basically just gently patting the ball back and forth over the net, and the Legendary mode is incredible - if you are someone who likes to be able to beat a game on its hardest difficulty, then you better be ready to sacrifice a lot of time practicing.  

Getting good will take time.  Getting anything better than rubbish will take time.  But it is so worth it - the sense of satisfaction when you finally learn how to control the spin and can sustain a rally is beyond any other game, because there is no predetermined animation - if something goes wrong, it's your fault.  In this way, this game is more realistic than any other I have played.

The multiplayer works well - I don't use online that much so I can't comment, but the few times I've played with a friend it has worked fine - no lag issues or sync problems.

The devs are very active on the Steam forums.  They are part time, so work doesn't go as quickly as some people would like, but they regularly push updates and seem committed to continuing to support this game, where other devs might have abandoned it as finished and moved on.  

All in all, if you're a fan of table tennis, or sport in general, or if you're really into immersion in VR or simply want to try out something new - I highly recommend this game.","Dec 18, 2017 at 5:33 PM",5, 4,

Racket Fury feels more arcady and less realistic where I struggled to find the right settings to get a good feel with my forehand. This game, I didn't have to tweak anything and the forehand and backhand felt perfect right from the onset. The forehand in particular, specifically with how I grip a real life paddle, felt perfect with regard to the angle of the racket with my wrist and how the ball spins off the racket including the distance the ball travels with how much force I use. It felt like a near perfect simulation and the Devs deserve credit for this.

I had bought this game on Steam and was extremely dissapointed that I couldn't get the game to feel right with the Touch Controllers no matter what I tried. That has been completely resolved with this game. 

I also want to give kudos to the Devs for not charging if you already had the Steam version. So many other devs do not do this, including experiences that were already on the GearVR. I'm extremely happy that I bought this on Steam knowing how it plays on the Oculus Rift. Again, if you want more of an arcady feel, that would be Racket Fury. This game is more if you wish you had a true table in your house. That is what I wanted.

I do hope they come out with more environments. I agree with another person that the most comfortable are the apartment and the winter one. I just wish I had a better looking apartment room than the one apartment choice there was, or an ESPN like building where it feels like you are in a tournament :-).

1. You can play single player (against AI) and against others online anytime you want.

2. You don't have to go hunting for the ball.

Matchmaking system makes it easy to pick people to play with and the physics of the ball is so accurate that I can't even tell the difference from the real game.  The game seems to have an odd placement of the paddle in this compared to the steam version of Eleven.  So make sure your paddles are aligned before starting a game the first time.

The physics are great, and very unforgiving (in other words, if you suck at table tennis in real life, you'll suck at table tennis in this game, too).
