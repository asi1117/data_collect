I am very glad they didnt take the easy way out and put in a bunch of jump scares cause given the circumstances it would of been to easy. They didnt need jump scares to create an unsettling and self torturous enviornment. It wasnt overly complicated and wasnt to dumbed down. A great interactive narative! Great story! 

Only complaint is how SLOW your character moves I understand the slow moving creates suspense but would of helped!

VERY UNIQUE!!","Mar 25, 2019 at 10:43 AM",4, 10,

My Thoughts:
I have played these types of games before and the concept works really well in VR. You have to use sound to find your way around the levels, finding objects and searching for clues. It's cleverly done.
Some of the puzzles are really obscure to solve and I did get stuck in the library so you might need to have a handy walkthrough on hand, just in case you get stuck.
It would have been nice for the developers to have a seperate echo effect (tip mode) for helping you to find clue locations.","Sep 19, 2018 at 11:11 PM",3, 19,
