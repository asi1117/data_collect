2022-05-28 17:15:41.752955,Masque1st,Awesome experience,"To me Felix&Paul studios have created the most memorable and impressive VR experiences thus far and I love all their productions. Gymnasia is again impressive, although on another scale compared to Marshall or Miyubi. It’s a very sweet and a bit creepy stopmotion movie where you have to think of the work of Quay (more so then Svankmajer). Only complaint you could have that it is too short and it leaves you with a desire for more. Very recommended!","Jun 16, 2020 at 3:35 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 17:15:41.796837,SkScotchegg,Really fantastic experience.,"I saw this and I thought why not, I think I only paid about £4. Really great short cinematic experience. The graphics were amazing, seemed like photo realistic and the atmosphere was great, I felt really scared whilst watching. 

I'm really glad I bought this short experience and will show this to all my friends. This is definitely a good experience to show what VR can produce other then games.","May 6, 2019 at 11:51 PM",5, 4,
