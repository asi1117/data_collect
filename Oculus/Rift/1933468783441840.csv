2022-05-28 18:09:01.599030,below_light,"Insanely fast paced, great concept","This is such a fantastic concept and the execution in VR seems solid - it genuinely has the feel of Quake 3 Arena but way faster, more responsive, harder to hit your opponent, and then throw in a dual locomotion mechanic (full smooth walk/run using controller + a really inventive use of teleportation) and you have the lunacy that is TelefragVR.

That said - perhaps because this is such a recent release, there is far too small a player base to make it the experience it deserves to be. While I've been playing today, it has been entirely against AI bots. Though the AI is brutal enough, I am really missing the added fun that comes with genuine human interaction in this game, so I'm waiting to see if it picks up pace and develops a (hopefully loyal) userbase over the coming days & weeks.

The matchmaking system could also do with some work, perhaps allowing the user to select an opponent or fight in teams rather than just 1 on 1, but hey you can't have everything.

The recommended spec on this is pretty low so if you have a Rift or a Vive I'd imagine it'd be fine. I'm running it on an i9 with a 2080 Ti and its been just buttery smooth so far.

Still not sure? Worth a go for sure. Maybe Oculus will promote it and help drive some other players to stick with it.","Jul 29, 2019 at 5:45 AM",5, 14,

Reminds me of the old quake arena, 1 on 1's.  Very fluid, graphics, frame rate, sound, ...   all seem really good.","Jul 20, 2019 at 8:35 PM",5, 21,
