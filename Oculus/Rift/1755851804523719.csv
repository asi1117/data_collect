Its a pretty in depth demo too., where in you get to build an entire engine from scratch. Its a little frusterating because it's easy to mess up a step and get loss and end up restarting from scratch. Its also outdated. The movement mechanics in the real game have improved and now the wrenches work a little different.

I received a response and was told to access extensions for the wrenches using A or X. I tried. Only saw the wrenches and no extensions. I was ready to write another review because I was a little mad. Well I played with it awhile and figured out I was not doing things right. So I want to apologize to the developers of Wrench for all the mean things I thought and tell all of you I LOVE THIS APP....I'm kinda old so maybe this new technology is a little hard for me.

Start the game too short, I felt like a dwarf, no way of changing settings ot be ""taller"". 
Objects you pick up and release just float where you release them, game needs gravity!
graphics isnt clerar, even wrtitten text right in front of you is unreadable, needs fixing.
Rotation is not smooth, its arc turning, needs smooth turning.

Good
no silly teleporting if you choose not to, this is something which is top of players list glad to see it included.

Thats it, couldnt actally play it for more than a few minutes because couldnt read anything and got peeved off with objects floating all over the room.

Tip: Wrench spinner only gets you to 2Nm of force. Let go of the trigger and then hand tighten until it clicks. I literally built the entire engine with 2Nm bolts and... well it didn't start. Tutorial error, but a lesson learned.

FUN!!!","Oct 28, 2019 at 1:18 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:08:11.448358,Iloveass,Very good just needs some fine tuning,"I love this game. The graphics are unreal! The only thing that bothers me is tightening and loosening bolts. It often happens that the wrench snaps to the wrong bolt and messes everything up. It would also be nice to hold the wrench at a different rotation instead of a fixed position relative to the hand, if that makes sense. Sometimes i'm really bending my wrists in weird angles when i'd rather just change the grip of the wrench. Also i couldnt get the engine to start because apparently the valve timing was off by 0 degrees (????).","Sep 27, 2019 at 2:44 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 17:08:14.602921,shuzzboots,Great!,"The app is really great. Great graphics, and all the pieces and steps as it would be in real life. It was great fun learning about it all, using the tools, and figuring out the process. I built my engine in a few hours but needed to go somewhere just as I was finishing it and putting the timing belt on. I couldn't find an exit or save button on the tablet (the thing that gives you the instructions), so I naively just shut the app down, assuming it would auto-save. Alas when I next opened it up to finish the engine, all the parts were right back on the table. If there was a save button, this would be a 5 star rating. As it is, I can't be bothered to spend another couple of hours putting it back together just to get to where I was, which is a real shame because I really wanted to see it in action.

That being said, I am currently downloading the full version of the game because I just want to build more stuff! Hopefully the full version will have a dedicated quit button. I encourage you all to try it.","Jul 19, 2019 at 3:43 AM",4, 0,

I've tried making this engine 5 times so far and it just keeps happening.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, the only thing keeping me from buying the full game is the fear that this will happen in the full version.  To my knowledge there's no way to save in this demo, so I can't just keep saving every couple of minutes like I want to.  Is there a way to save in the full game?","Jul 10, 2019 at 8:29 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 17:08:17.723574,CWC333,,"This can be a frustating and rewarding game all in one. I would recommend it. I built the engine twice. FIrst time I had a few bolts not to torque spec and didn't want to tear down the engine to get to them. Tried again another day and after solving a few problems, success! If you don't have everything right, the engine will not start. Beware, you can accidentally get your wrench on bolts that are not even part of the engine assembly process and change the value to out of spec and engine will not start until you correct it. This happened to me. Also when manipulating the engine while working on it you can accidentally grab parts inside the engine and uninstall them. And it can be a real pain to get them back where they go. (You may have to stick your head literally inside the engine).  I recommend only grabbing the engine near the edge to turn it. Timing can be a bit of trouble to get right as well, you may have to pull the belt off a few times to get it right. (Hint - turn the cams and crank with a medium ratchet to position them, turn the engine over and make sure it's right). Overall this was a lot of fun and gave my brain a workout:)","Jun 23, 2019 at 12:46 PM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 17:08:23.982833,Awestrike_,Constructive Criticism,"I should probably give this five stars for being hours of free education and fun, but there are still areas for improvement.
1) When the menu is open to select torque wrench, etc., make it impossible to accidentally grab and manipulate additional objects (beyond what may already be in your hand).
2) For torque adjustments allow a 0.2 second delay after a single click (i.e. 0.1 NM) before ramping continously.  This will make single clicks easier.  Then after the 0.2 seconds, ramp at a constant rate that is 2x or 3x as fast as the current rate.
2) Increase speed of hand-torqueing bolts to 2x or 3x.  It should not take 5 seconds per bolt that is already snug.
3) Cam timing is buggy because sometimes it gave me -359.999 degrees with no start, and sometimes +.001 degrees with successful start.  I made no changes, and just hit the start button again, but there is less than 50% success rate.
4)  I found a possible bug where I grabbed a bearing half out of the crankshaft journal while the crankshaft, pistons, and oilpan were bolted.  I should have known something was wrong when I had to skip past the crankshaft section.  The strange thing was that before I removed the bearing, it moved along with the engine block. 
5) The controls are a bit clunky when learning, and it takes a while to figure everything out to where you're good at it.  The biggest problems are A) The tutorial is not very clear that electric mode does NOT torque to the indicated value B) grabbing the wrong object, (which could be fixed by more obviously highlighting the object to be picked up (one highlight per hand) and then removing the highlight once it's picked up, and C)  Tutorial should discuss view modes (joystick depress). Reduce amount of rotation per side joystick to 1/2 current value","Jan 3, 2019 at 10:53 AM",4, 13,

Other than maybe making it so that your hands dont keep grabing the engine instead of the wrench when you letgo to stop torquing bolts. 100% AAA quality game. 
Can't wait for the full release it will be a day one buy for me. 
(also having your cam phasing off is realitively common with miatas. I advance my intake by 1 tooth, and retard the exhaust by 1 tooth. Gets you a bit more overlap in the cams and some better top end.) Only sad that i didn't get to hear the engine run once i completed it. :(","Nov 9, 2018 at 2:39 PM",5, 44,

2022-05-28 17:08:27.202222,CornelisJ12,"Great experience, bugged engine timing.","Very nicely made lil game. enjoyed building the engine alot. its just a shame ive never gotten to start it as the engine timing thing is completly bugged. The timing thing itself is already incerdibly annoying and cumbersome since the cams keep changing way more than they are needed to reach the perfect mark. However whicg I found far more annoying is that after youve finally achieved the perfect positions for timing the engine still does not start as it often randomly says the timing is wrong while the timing markers are alligned perfectly. It just randomly messes up the timing and you gotta do everything over again. mustve tried about 8 times now and ive never gotten it to work. It once even said the timing belt was -399.99 degrees off.

2022-05-28 17:08:27.217183,JohnnyLee,Fun Simulation,"Parts all look like the real deal. It's really fun doing this engine assembly. Only suggestion would be a better order of assembly. If you leave out something small, like the thrust bearings, you're up the creek and need to start over or take the crankshaft all apart again. I used to rebuild automatic transmissions and just like engines, the assembly order is critical.
EDIT:  Looks like the vanishing parts bug has been fixed. The only issue I can see now is the torque specs are a little buggy. For example, I was extra carefull to get each nut and bolt exactly to specs, but at engine startup, it failed because a few of the torque specs were now showing as way off and I know they were reading correct at assembly (at least according to the wrench torque break specs the instructions provided). That appears to be bugged somewhat. Again, as a transmission mechanic for many years, I know how to use a torque wrench. After removing and tightening the bolts again, the engine cranked right up.

I was pretty slow and had to backtrack once so I'm sure I spent over an hour on it. I was hoping to save my work and continue to the next phase at a later time but I wasn't able to figure out how to do that. Otherwise this is really cool. I'd love to be able to set my tools on the table rather than pulling them from the floating menu.

Things I'd like to see change:

1) Upon users pressing B to pull up their ""inventory"" items should pop up on their wrist allowing users to select tools that way v.s. a large selection of tools that obtrude into objects.

2) Height Adjustable Tables.

3) Backround music. Yes I was playing my own but in-game music would be nice too. Just be sure to give us the option to turn it off or adjust the volume as we please.

4) The angle at which tools are held in users hands.

5) The ability to walk faster.

6) Items (such as screws and tools) should no be able to be placed inside of tables. (I had a hard time finding one piece at one point).

2022-05-28 17:08:36.654940,Calipso,Simple but great simulator,"This is a great simulator and demonstration of what the game can become. The models are great, the instructions are usually clear enough, and the toolset is sufficient. It's limited to just assembling a single engine, but that is enough to get the point across and show what the game can be. There are non-VR games where you assemble or dissemble things, and this shows how much better it is in VR.
This can provide a great hands-on learning experience without getting your hands dirty. It could benefit from a few minor tweaks, and it took me a while to figure out that the tools really are powered, but they truly are minor tweaks. For example, it would be nice if the torque wrench adjustments had some acceleration when going through the increments, so it doesn't take quite as long to change from 15 to 50. And it takes a bit longer than I'd hope to hit the torque limit for each bolt. And there are a few stages of the instructions that could use a bit more text, even though the pictures are more than sufficient. Those really are the only tweaks I could suggest; the game is still a 10 out of 10 for its limited scope, especially when it is free.

I only had to dissassemble the engine three times because I forgot parts - which is very realistic and similar to my prior experience. The only flaw is that the oil containers run out eventually.

Just like in real life, if you do something out of order or forget a part you have to undo a bunch of bolts and redo it all. I had to remove the oil pan twice haha.

The only real issue I had was with bolt torques like some other people. I was very careful to set the wrenches to the exact specified torque for every bolt. (Yes I've used torque wrenches before.) But when I got to the end it showed all the bolts were torqued incorrectly so the engine didn't start. :(  
...I've just watched a video on the game's website and realized I may have done it wrong. So I will try again later. I was going to gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the torque issue but it seems that was possibly my error and not a bug.

Some things I think would be cool would be a save function and maybe an ""expert"" mode where everything is affected by gravity. :)","Nov 27, 2018 at 11:41 AM",5, 0,

Ok be honest who put the oil pan on then looked right to see the pistions sitting on the table?
Well done. I wish my girl friend would play she would love it.

Update
Started over. 
Put it together and tried to start the engine.
Well half the bolts were the wrong torque. 
I was very carful about this as I saw someone else had the same issue.
Disappointing as I don't want to start over or tear it down again.

1: If I had to start over every time the SO called me into the house or had to stop for the night it would get old. I hope the full version has a save progress.
2: There should be some indication when the bolts are the correct torque. If I put a wrench on a bolt and its already good it should give me another click.
3: The way the wrench is held is not comfortable and I don't see how to change it.
4: Hell yes I threw the wrench out the window, several times

- More information on what each part does and why it's needed. Maybe some more info or history
- Would love to see it 'run'. Showing timing and the path of the water, oil, air and fuel flows...
- Better SFX. MUSIC!
- The wrenches are a little annoying how they don't want to release
- Trun on physics. Or at least have an option.
- Build order was sometimes a little unclear. If you follow the tutorial strictly it's ok, but the build instructions con sometimes lead you in to doing things in the wrong order (minor)

Some suggestions for the future

* Add an extension (auto length?) between the socket and ratchet when the ratchet unavoidably interferes with components. It breaks immersion when the ratchet can move through the engine block for instance

* Allow an option for a more comprehensive build. I.E. piston pins, rings / cams valves etc...

* Electrical diagnosis-DVOM to test/troubleshoot  starters, alternators, ignition systems etc...

* Make the table surface solid and allow parts / tools to rest on it

* An optional engine stand would be nice so I don't keep grabbing and moving the block by accident

First off i really like the idea & time spent in the demo was really enjoyable. But i really hope the game is released as early access & the final product is much better. What is good:
The graphics are great, the parts looks very realistic & the dev has done a fantastic job here. The detail of the parts is exquisite.
The idea is great, there is the educational side, the puzzle element, the future possibilities of where this could go (imagine if they add not just cars but bikes, trains aircraft). 
Not so good:
Options are ok but free movement is a bit slow, its not dynamic. I think some tweaking is needed here. 
The enviroment you work in basically looks nothing like a garage & just looks like a generic house pulled of unreal content library. 
Sound doesn't match the quality of the graphics, there is no atmospheric background noise for example. Just needs more work imo. 
Controls & tools just needs refining, the tool displays are a little glitchy, need a better way to aim the scanner. These are quite minor things but the tools & way you interact with the enviroment is the most important thing imo.","Nov 9, 2018 at 7:21 PM",4, 3,You can adjust movement speed in the settings app.

The potential for this is also incredibly wide open with hopes that the full version will involve all vehicle systems (brakes, exhaust, suspension etc...) to service,  modify and repair. Also looking forward to multiple engines of different types and how the actual gameplay elements will come into this. I expect there may be elements based on how fast to repair, accuracy and tweaking performance just as a basic start.

Looking forward to more tools, to work on the vehicles too.

Some tweaking to do before full release on things like the stickyness of your hands, easier navigation in the in game tablet and some overall minor quality of life options will make it even better.

2022-05-28 17:08:49.299121,BigPinkDragon286,,"I'm giving this two stars because the idea is great, but the implementation has that feel of both being written by somebody who isn't very familiar with VR and has no experience working on engines. It's extremely off-putting to literally stick your wrenches through the side of an engine block to tighten bolts. This pretty much ruins one of the primary experiences of using tools which is, using the correct tool for the job. It's cute that you are able to break bolts by overtorquing them, but it should also be possible to break the smaller wrenches by misusing them. Furthermore, please add extensions so that the wrench handle isn't tightening through solid objects. That is jarringly silly. Next, it may sound rude, but do the developers ever used the teleport system in the program? Why am I not facing the direction of the arrow after teleporting? The movement in your program is counter intuitive, and until I figured out the free movement, couldn't get properly situated near the working spaces. Another issue is gravity. Implement some consistent form of it. I want to put my bolts into the parts bowl, not have them floating mysteriously above it. I also want my engine block mounted to an engine stand, not floating in mid air, so I can move it with some consistency and be able to work with it. As another reviewer stated, it would be good if the installation was performed in a more proper fashion. I had the windage tray installed before the pistons went in, thanks to your silly instructions. Once the more irritating aspects of this title get worked out, I think it can easily be a five star install. Until then however, one of the absolute most frustrating VR titles I've tried to work my way through. I also ran into the problem of being unable to turn the crank shafts to set the timing. Please make it clear that you can use the standard wrench on them. I get you can't turn them by hand, but it wasn't immediately obvious that my standard wrenches were what I was looking for.","Nov 11, 2018 at 2:46 PM",2, 2,

But I have been following this game for over a year, and when I saw the demo was out, I stayed up all night to build my first engine on the platform. Having rebuilt multiple engines in real life, this is as close as a video game has ever been to the real experiance. I am always chasing more realistic games that actually allow you to do the work the way it is supposed to be done. I've seen some comments that they are unable to install gaskets, try installing them on the part itself or on the engine block. As for the comment saying they didn't want to torque every bolt, I agree with the developer that there should be different modes that allow for a more casual gameplay. You should call it ""Shade-Tree Mechanic"" and in the description instruct that everything can be German torqued ""Good and tight."" It would be nice to see later implementation of boundries so tools can not go through the block and forces the player to tear down the engine if they forget to install something. But this would also require the implementation of extensions for each rachet. As for things missing from the game, my judgement is a little clouded from the excitment that the demo is out. I'm not sure if anyone else is having this issue, but I have no audio for the game. I don't mind though because I just blast music like I do in my actual shop. There's an idea though, maybe add a shop radio that players can drop their own .MP3 files into and listen to while playing. I don't know if it interests the developer, but maybe instead of a tool inventory, you have a physical tool box you have to roll to where you are working at?

I also aparently don't have any clue how to use a torque wrench.  For some reason I thought you were supposed to wrench on them up until they click/break.  I thought I did that, but in the end, when my engine wouldn't start (timing was way off) I also got a list of just about every single bolt in the system being over torqued.   So I suppose I was doing it wrong? 

With all that said, I still thought it was a very cool experience, and I wish I could get a model for an old Continental O-170, because that's what I used to have on my airplane and I would love to learn more about everything going on inside of it.

Lastly, I thought the system would be a little more ""hand holdy"" getting me through the steps, and I was actually happy it wasn't.  Part of the challenge was scanning parts, looking at diagrams and figuring out on my own the correct order to install.    After I got the oil pan on and was ready to move onto the next step I realized that I completely forgot a couple of the seals...
