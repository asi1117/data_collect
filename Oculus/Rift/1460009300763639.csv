2022-05-28 19:34:40.753206,MattIsMyName,"As a Kickstarter Demo, Uninspiring.","This is a demo that I assume is supposed to push you to fund the Kickstarter, but it's not doing a very good job of that. Yes the demo takes place right after what I assume is some kind of cave in, but the dusty view and the constant coughing is annoying. The puzzle is either going to be immediately evident or wind up like the other guy in the reviews who couldn't figure it out. There's no setup for the story, there's no evidence of the ways to use the torch, the puzzle's solution was clipped into the wall for me - I almost missed it. The pieces of the puzzle snap to one direction every time you pick them up - the wrong direction, by the way, even worse. I had to crank my hand around to face them correctly. I'd have liked to see the protagonist talking to himself as a way to nudge you in the right direction, but yeah like I said, the way things are now this defnitely didn't make me want to fund the game.","May 20, 2018 at 11:28 AM",1, 13,

2022-05-28 19:34:40.782129,Revving,Sad presentation.,This experience is far too short to truly attract an audience. The controls are a bit clunky and the graphics are dated. The walking motion will make some people feel sick.,"Jun 11, 2018 at 10:26 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:34:40.797089,SUPERSONICSTATION,Rating this as a demo as of now WIP,"Raiting on the demo alone before full release as of 8/11/18
I'm very excited and can't wait to play the finished product. I'm a huge horror fan and sometime I just like to sit in VR and get scared, jump scares. I love the invironment and from the demo it works very good. I'm not gonna complain about a free demo so.... On that note I just can't wait for them to finish the game and release it.","Aug 11, 2018 at 4:52 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 19:34:43.913847,DisplayVRC,yeah ...,"Its a demo , Its free , cant say anything more about it.  cant walk properly bec there are invisible walls , and my character needs to see a doc. all that smoke caused him nothing good. If it become a good horror game in about 6 months i will buy it. But putting this in store is waaaay to soon.","May 21, 2018 at 5:48 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:43.928807,melloVR,Nice try,"Maybe I'm stupid, but I can't even use the key at the beginning. The immersion is bad, but at least it's just a demo and for free...","May 18, 2018 at 7:14 AM",2, 4,
