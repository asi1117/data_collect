Honestly when free content is better than your paid game you've gotta reconsider some things.","Dec 30, 2019 at 12:50 AM",1, 16,

Seems like it's a bug, since it stops the game entirely... would love to leave a better review but it's made gameplay frustrating.","Jun 5, 2019 at 1:19 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 16:42:38.326397,Wingnutradio,This is a super fun game one of my favs!,"++UPDATE++ My sound won't work on this app anymore...
**** THE SOUND WILL NOT WORK ON THE GAME NOW?****
Trust me you need this game! It is super addictive and something you will enjoy for hours and hours!  I wish they had more levels to play they are fun to complete.  I also wish they updated the game more?  For some reason I can't ever to connect to play with other online players?  It's fun playing the computer but would be great to play others from around the globe! :) Please update this game for your fans, it is so much fun to play!","Jan 19, 2020 at 2:21 AM",5, 9,"Current MP is quite limited in a way that players have to be available at the MP lobby at the same time in ""Looking for Player"" mode for matchmaking to pair 2 of them.
The ""local"" duel match will then take place, with pre-set mission goal that any of the 2 players have decided.
However despite all these, PvP match still works."
