2022-05-28 14:57:37.130276,Horris1983,,Great game. My problem is the Oculus Store version is VR only.  Steam version allows both options. Sometimes I just wanna throw it up on the big screen and can’t do that.  Awesome rally game! but don’t buy from here!,Apr 17 at 12:33 AM,2, 11,
2022-05-28 14:57:37.145236,LarryGoldstien,My most played VR Game,Outside of Halflife: Alyx this is the best game on Oculus. The immersive graphics and realistic game play are without comparison. Playing it over the past year or so there have been bugs but I tolerate them for the gameplay because it's that good.,Feb 16 at 6:17 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:57:37.160196,chris.kauten.92,completely unplayable,open app and it requests you to hit enter.  you then have to take off the headset and find our keyboard and hit enter.  then nothing happiness 75% of the time. 24% of the time enter works and then you get to the main menu and then nothing else works.  How ever the golden 1% of the time the keyboard will allow you to get to settings to setup your steering wheel and the peddles will work but the steering wheel will not. You will fight it for the next 2 hours until you give up and hunt through the internet for solutions until you give up and come here to complain bout it.  At this point in computer game development why do I have to be a computer programmer just to play a game?,Jan 23 at 6:23 AM,1, 6,

I have no sound, so I did what any normal person would do and youtubed ""fix sound on dirt 2.0 VR on oculus, I also googled it. I found lots of hits of people having the same problems. One solution was to go through steam. I don't use steam as I feel not comfortable using a back door of some sort to get a game to work. I bought it on the oculus store so it should work flawlessly.  So I tried for a night or two and could never get sound. I know there can bugs in games so I emailed the company that made it.

2022-05-28 14:57:40.350663,Marcan37,Seriously .... not sure at all ...,"I find this game disapointing on the Quest 2 headset. It's like there is no improvement from Dirt 1 ... and like I have a CV1 , not a Quest 2 . Normally , Rift S games run very well on Quest 2 but this one has poor graphics . I'll try to upscale with Oculus Portal Resolution but ... driving in a cockpit without any other choice and cams ... ... is not convincing cause the resolution is very blurry for the outside... which is what I want to see better normally . 

Not impressed. Won't ask a refund but may ask a core to play in 2d via Steam cause sincerely .... it's not good on the eyes. It's like playing a really old pc game in as low as 800x600px resolution or 1280x720 px. I'd like a view without the dash so we can at least put all the headset's resolution on the outside, not the cockpit. I know it may feel strange to look around in this kind of view but I'd prefer that than to loose all the scenery quality. 

I see super good what's in my car but I don't see good what's the more important in the game , the road .

Not sure what to tell you , I think I may regret I have bought this game but I did it while it was in promotion and may play it in the future if it updates a bit cause it's supporting Link but ... not convincing on the eyes . The feeling would be good if all the scenery outside didn't look all ... blurry and.... really low res.","Jan 1, 2021 at 6:00 AM",3, 36,
2022-05-28 14:57:40.365622,alexo417,probably the WORST vr game ive played,"ok so, I hate this game because of ONE LITTLE MISTAKE. i paid for this game so that i can drive with my two controllers like im DRIVING IN REAL LIFE (thats what vr is for) but instead i have to play on my keyboard and it took me so long too figure out just to move but if I played it with my controllers, that limits me guessing what the controls are and i can play the game more affectively. this is my first game i have ever played were i was so unbelievably bored because i dont know the controls because im playing on a key bored. I dont even know how to drift so i keep crashing. why didnt i look at the controls? because i was so hyped up for driving with my hands and i like those kind of games but now knowing that i have to use my keyboard, i dont even want to know how to drift because it would be a waste of time because im never playing this piece of s*** ever again. do not play if you like playing with your controllers.

2022-05-28 14:57:46.677740,Red_Go,Way better than steam version,"I bought it from steam and switch to oculus version.  Some say they are the same now, but it's definitely not.  Oculus version is way way better than steam version.  First, steam version has weird flat screen ratio so all the HUD signs are squized, almost unreadable, but oculus verstion has no problem with ratio.  Second, it seems to use less resources of CPU & GPU so frame rate is more stable.  Just with these two things, it gives much better experiences.  

Down side is....  it's way more expensive, no DLC yet.  Force feedback and vibration is much less than steam version so it needs to be adjusted about 140%.  Sound level is also a bit low (about 70% compared to steam version).  

I guess basically Steam and Oculus version are the same game.  But for VR, Oculus version is way better, much more stable.","Mar 19, 2020 at 12:44 PM",4, 42,

only reason this is not 5 stars is, in some cars when you recenter your view in hmd your head is 3-4 "" behind your neck, so you have to slide  forward ,basically line your neck up with the view instead of the other way round

The picture is clear, but i need to use Oculus Tray Tool to adjust supersampling to the desired level (1.4 on GTX 1070). The game runs exceptionally smooth, the frametime is a way more linear than in any other racing games i've tried. You can run this version also on display with the -novr switch.

The only downside of this game is the FFB, it's so empty sometimes, which corrupts the game VR immersion. I've tried many settings, but it's basically too simple, it seems many force effect are missing from the math. If you don't know what i mean try Assetto Corsa Competizione, and you will understand.

Apart from the FFB this game is so good! Flying on the Finalnd stages or slipping in Monte Carlo is totally awsome! I grinned at every turn. If you like rallying its a must try.","Mar 31, 2020 at 5:17 PM",4, 5,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyiVbknx0-E
(Please Note: Links might not work from Oculus so please search YouTube for 'Paradise Decay VR Dirt Rally 2')

**IMPORTANT / PLEASE NOTE: I think the camera resetting (As mentioned in my Video and this Review) is a fault with the NEW Oculus BETA CLIENT, I had the same issue in 'Dirt Rally 1' and 'Until You Fall' - People say its a fault with Oculus. I am looking into it.


The game defaults to the lowest settings on GTX 1060 (6GB) and its playable on 'Ultra Low' and 'low' settings if you just want to race and don't mind all the graphic fedelity. The game does look more blurry on the lowest settings and I did get some graphic improvements tweaking textures, shaders etc, but the frame rate was good.
I think the game will slowly be optimised over the coming months so you might be able to tweak the graphics even more.
I did play around with all graphic settings and the game looked amazing on Ultra, but you will probably need a 1070 or higher to appreciate these settings. (as stated in the games specs sheet)
If you have a 1060, I would probably say give the 1st 'DiRT Rally' game a go first, you'll get a very similar experience.
This game feels more of the same on a lower end card, and you really do need a beefy card to benefit what 'DiRT Rally 2' has to offer.
My only real complaints was the camera jumping to the side of the vehicle randomly throughout the game which you can see in my video.
These jumps happened more frequently the higher the settings, which suggest either my 1060 trying to cope, or a fault/error with my Rift S tracking.
(I'll need to look into this more)","Aug 10, 2019 at 2:37 PM",4, 25,

 Nice potential, controls work and game runs at 80 FPS on my Rift S. However, there is no sound whatsoever. Sound works fine on everything else.  I also see where many others are reporting the same thing. This effects only the version purchased in the Oculus store. The Steam version has sound but no native Oculus support and it runs like crap. BTW, it's time that CM learns about the new-fangled device for a PC called a MOUSE! Please start including mouse support in your games. It's very awkward trying to navigate on a keyboard when wearing your PC headset.","Aug 13, 2019 at 5:26 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 14:58:08.837471,Ham_VR,Great game - one staring due to price,"Like many other here have said, I also picked this up on Steam VR assuming it would run fine on my Rift-S and 1080ti (like DiRT 1.0 does), to then find out the Oculus SDK (optimised) version is only available through the Oculus store at £44.99 which you can only play in VR mode (no 2D desktop mode in this version!). Compare this to the steam price which is on sale today at £17.99 and not only that, the Steam version offers both VR and 2D mode games. Very bad business practice by Facebook and/or Codemasters.  Even if you love the game, it's got to be one star at that price.","Sep 15, 2019 at 5:27 PM",1, 7,

The thing is, dirt rally 1 was a great title. But it was poorly optimised. Dirt Rally 2.0 works with all the graphics settings set to ultra, and still have 30% headroom for supersampling (2080ti). On my 1080ti, all the settings were set to medium, solid 80fps on the rift S. This helps a lot in immersing yourself behind the wheel, and just enjoy driving. I will not try to compare handling, and other aspects of the game, because that is different with every person. One thing we all have in common in VR is graphics, and how the game performs. In my opinion, dirt rally 2.0 nailed it!","Aug 15, 2019 at 1:18 PM",5, 5,

Upgraded to 4 stars. The game is terriffic however it's missing much of the DLC from the Steam version. Hope we won't have to pay for it seeing as at the time of this review the Steam version and all DLC is 50% off. I also think we need the option to play in non VR mode. Every now and then it's nice to be able to play if I don't feel like having the headset on. Performance is good.

2022-05-28 14:58:15.139615,86themadhatter,A Must For Dirt Rally 1.0 Fans,"As of this review i have played 2+ hours of the game testing different cars in most countries.

GTX 1080
32GB DDR4 3200mhz
i7-7700k 4.8Ghz
Rift CV1
Mix of Medium/Low settings 90fps with a slight stutter every few seconds (even if i'm stopped and looking straight ahead it dips to 70fps and back to 90)  I'm sure some tweaks will help.  (I'll update this when i have more time put in)

Pros:  Sense of speed, cars feel much heavier and grounded.  Physics feel pretty solid too.  Can place the car where you want it a lot easier now when going sideways.  Driver now rotates the wheel more than 360 degrees so his movements will now match your wheel rotation unlike Dirt 1.0
Easily accessable for new players.  Pacenotes seem pretty spot on so far.  T300RS wheel and custom Ebrake and shifter all recognized and easily bindable (nice work)

Cons: The price if you're mainly purchasing for rally is a bit high.  Stages are the usual , 1 or 2 long stages broken into multiple stages and ran forward and reverse.   Lack of WRC cars (personal preference)  
From what i can see and i'll edit if wrong, replays are projected on a screen in front of you instead of being fully VR.  

All in all, a nice step up from Dirt Rally.  Can't wait till the DLC arrives to the Oculus version so that we can enjoy some stages i absolutely loved with a new physics overhaul","Aug 11, 2019 at 5:24 AM",4, 6,

SOUND FIX
A fix for anyone else having a problem with no sound in game is to disable all other audio devices except the one you want to use. Bit annoying but only takes a second and is well worth it.

An issue I have is you can't use the steering wheel to navigate the menus, neither the mouse. so you have to use the arrow keys on keyboard to navigate which can be awkward, especially when you have to find your ESC key with the VR headset on! Same issue with the non vr version though","Aug 11, 2019 at 6:05 AM",5, 6,

 Cars have more weight in them and you can feel the grip or when losing it. 

There are also some not so good things like bad force feedback (tested on g920) and lack of information of different options and what they do.

Game also runs playable with 1060 6gb. Preset low and anisotropic x16.","Aug 9, 2019 at 7:47 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 14:58:18.301159,Nightfrost00,"Great rally game, improved over DiRT 1","DiRT 1.0 is easily my most played VR title, tracking into hundreds of hours played. So my expectiations were high for the successor, and Codemasters managed to deliver! This is easily the best rally game out there, surpassing both the original DiRT as well as Richard Burns Rally.

Dont let negative comments in forums regarding force feedback and graphics fool you (as they did me, while waiting for the VR version). Everything worked fine straight out of the box. Device management is well done this time, and graphics work wonderfully on mid settings on a Geforce 1080 (non-Ti) with a Rift CV1. Force feedback is excellent with a SimuCube DD1 wheel (very similar to DiRT Rally 1, no filters whatsoever required despite reconstruction 1). So there's no need to go back to the previous version now.

Regarding the price: It's comparably high, especially with additional content, but rally racing is really a niche. As long as the money is used to continue this awesome series, it's fine with me :)","Aug 9, 2019 at 8:25 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:58:18.317116,JoeKsux,Very good game that needs a little work,"System Specs: 8600K @ 4.8Ghz, 32gb ddr4, 2080 TI, Rift S, Thrusmaster TX

This game is quite beautiful, though I'm a little suprised that I can only run the game on high settings, and not on ultra. Ultra settings introduce a lot of stutter and frame rate dropping :(

The wheel feels decent after tweeking the settings a bit, but seems like they might need a bit of work on the forced feedback side of things, as it can be a little underwhelming right now. The in game settings also seem to be a bit bare bones right now, so hopefully they will patch and fix this stuff in the future. 

The VR spectator screen is displayed as both lenses rather than a full screen view, and I can't seem to find an option to change it in game, which is kinda annoying. There also isnt an option to assign a button on your wheel to 'Reset VR View' which means you have to pause the game, or use the controller to do it.

Overall Id say it's a pretty good game so far, but it could be an amazing game with some performance tweeks and more FFB/wheel settings and customization settings.","Aug 10, 2019 at 9:57 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 14:58:21.456718,brenttwalker,It was good for an arcade game,"Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations, but I simply found this title to be good or acceptable for $59.  I have raced a lot of racing titles, both VR and non-VR.  Formula One 2005 to present, iRacing since inception, Nascar when it was called ""Hawaii"" for online play, the Corse series,  and a Rally game that I can't really remember (but was incredibly fun with just a gamepad).

Perhaps I was just expecting too much, but the steering is vague (I have a Logitech G29) and I had damage turned on but I saw no damage occuring while I was massively wiping out and rolling.  I'm sure I'll be able to get better at the game, but I will stop playing it pretty quickly if the ""realism"" is what I think it is.  I'm not interested in arcade driving games for $59...
