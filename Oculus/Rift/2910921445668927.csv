My Initial Impressions:
From the creative minds that brought us the Amazing Fisherman's Tale comes another blinder of a puzzle game.
This game is superb, unique and would ONLY really work in VR.
This is something refreshing, new and bound to stick in your minds for a long while.
My only gripe if anything would be a puzzle element to make finding the ingredients a bit more challenging.
All in all superb!","Apr 22, 2021 at 1:19 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 20:38:21.281105,RuneSR2,Awesome game - a true must have!,"When you put on the VR hmd, it's like going through a portal and suddenly you're in another world. This is exactly what Maskmaker is copying - and it works great. 
It's a beautiful game, especially the game does impress with great vistas and extreme view distances - when it really opens up (for example in the mountains).
Using my Rift CV1 I get solid 90 fps with high levels of super sampling (ss) and in-game graphics maxed (=High).  Thus performance was great using ss 2.0 with my GTX 1080, but ASW 2.0 did kick in here'n there. One bridge - felt like 1.5 km or 1 mile away, was still possible to see clearly with the CV1 ss 2.0 - that's the true power of ss 2.0. Colors totally pop with the CV1 being oled - this game has some of the most awesome colors ever seen in a VR game, at least with the Rift CV1. 
There's a lot of great story telling, which may mean that this game is mostly made for adults - who have sufficient cognitive abilities to really comprehend and appreciate the story. But sure kids can have a lot of fun too, this is not a scary game. 
The game feels somewhat like Myst, so it's not really a social game, but a great place to be alone - also to reduce everyday stress. Or maybe to provide a feeling of getting out in the open in these closed Covid-19 times.  
The game is not like A Fisherman's Tale apart from having to do some puzzles. You have to create different masks to access new locations. The combinations of masks, mask add-on items and mask colors are great - so the masks are puzzles in themselves, and what drives the game.
Controls are fine - and there're smooth turning and full locomotion.
The games has many high-res textures, but these cannot be seen in the game trailers. Poly levels are fine - there are many round objects, and in locations with great view distances poly levels are certainly quite high. This is a true PCVR game - and I look forward to enjoy it more later this evening.","Apr 27, 2021 at 5:47 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:38:21.298060,shaudog108,game breaking bug/ soft locked,"Let me start off by saying I love this game, hands down 5 stars under any other circumstance but this one. the puzzles are entertaining, the mask crafting is insanely fun, the worlds in both graphics and lore are extremely well built, I can't express more how amazing this game really is. But *SPOILERS AHEAD* i was about to start my final ""ascent"" after opening the flood gates in the desert, and as the purple masked character, I fell through the ground and into the water pit below the tower. Confused, i restarted the game before it could save, and repeated the scene again. Still, clipped through the rising platform and into the water. I tried to switch into the red masked character during the ascent, and i watched ""purple mask"" fall through while i stayed on the platform, and upon switching back, in the pool again. I tried going back the workshop, basically resaved my game and now i can't even hear the story being told while i helplessly flail around in the water pool. I tried resetting my height, seated play, glitch-walking, in-game walking, teleporting, everything i could think of, and still nothing solved my issue. This is my first playthrough, four hours and 10 minutes in, and i have truly fallen in love with this game, and i'm so emotionally attached to the story that I'm embarrased to go into detail. But this glitch has ruined the magic for me, and even if i restart a new save file, it will just feel like a video game again, and not like a heroic adventure like i believed before. If the developers could respond and maybe help, I would greatly appreciate it, and it might just bring back the magic that i found playing your game. I'll change my review if my problem is fixed, because this truly is a 5 star game.","May 3, 2021 at 5:34 PM",2, 3,"Hello there, so sorry for the late reply, thanks for your kind words and sorry you had this issue! 
Since your review we have worked on a patch to solve this issue actually. It will avoid users having the same issue in the future but it won't automatically fix your save file. That said we can patch it manually and would be happy to, so you can finish the game properly. Please shoot us an email at support@innerspacevr.com and we'll tell you how to proceed. Thanks very much!"
2022-05-28 20:38:21.314017,Bird-boy,A great game with a great story,I loved this game the story was pretty good and the puzzles were actually a little challenging my only problem was for some reason I was getting head aches and a little nauseous while playing now im not new to vr I have played many vr games for many years but I just cant tell why I started feeling that way other than that definitly worth 20$,"Apr 22, 2021 at 12:28 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 20:38:21.343937,G4mb10r,"Good, but buggy","I actually really enjoyed the game and wanted to give it 4 stars for a great story and fun gameplay (though perhaps too simple of puzzles).... BUT I had to drop stars because I ran into a game-breaking bug and couldn't finish the game.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

The Bug: So, I was on the last mask (purple and red), rising up the tower with my other self. The voices were talking and preparing me for the end. I accidently took off the mask. I quickly put it back on, but the voices had stopped and without any movement on my part, I got pushed off the platform into the water below, where I was then stuck for eternity. I tried reloading without saving, hoping to get back to a good spot... I loaded and was still on the platform, but again, an invisible force kept pushing me off. Tried again and again, kept ending up in the water below. Now I'm stuck down there permanently... no way to finish the game. Very bummed because I was really enjoying it 😔","May 12, 2021 at 8:50 AM",2, 0,"Hello, thanks for your feedback and sorry you had this issue!

2022-05-28 20:38:24.444644,xxSILVxx,Loved every minute,"An enchanting game with great narrative and art direction.Hooked from start to finish. A great vr studio with a growing library of quality vr games. Well done to all.
P.S if possible give option to increase turn speed for smooth a little bit more than its max.👍","Apr 28, 2021 at 12:27 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:38:24.459605,MartienAnonyme,"Very polished, but sadly repetitive...","A lot of love has been obviously put into this game by the dev team, and the first times experimenting the different mechanics that will be used further as the gameplay base, are really satisfying and even mesmerizing.
But the problem is that passed the first say 30mn, it is a repetition of the exact same principles (can't explain without spoiling, so will refrain) all the way to progress into the story, which is actually totally linear.
The only ""challenges"" that I faced were:
1. Not understanding that you have to use teleportation instead of free move to offboard the gondola (very bad game design here)
2. Overlooking some ingredients placed into the environment

Graphically wise, the artistic direction is very solid but not exploiting the PC platform resources, and it looks like it could ported to Quest 2 (but probably not not Quest 1?).
Sound atmosphere is great, but some phrases in the workshop are repeated too often.


Without any replayability after the 4~5 hours it last, pricing is very honest though, hence 3 stars for me.","May 5, 2021 at 8:47 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:38:24.474565,chuck.ungar,"Impressive, creative, expansive puzzler",This game starts out kind of slow but as the worlds expand in complexity and design it becomes a great puzzle game. Don't give up if you find the first level boring. It gets a lot better.,"Apr 26, 2021 at 5:56 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 20:38:27.581255,Skrunkster,I was just a goober at first,Thanks to the developers for getting back with me.  I feel like a bit of a goober for saying something I did was a bug.  Part of it was but most of it wasn't.  It's a really great game.  A must have.  Really great story and fun gameplay.,"Apr 27, 2021 at 8:32 AM",5, 1,"Hello, thanks for your feedback and sorry you had these issues. There two things here:
1. The reason why the left joystick is deactivated is probably because you chose to deactivate Free locomotion in the menu (maybe inadvertently!) If you go to the main menu>movement>free locomotion you have three settings available there: Head/Hand/Off. Yours should be set to 'Off' currently, but if your want your stick to be operational you can choose one of the others.
2. Unfortunately, we just discovered that the ""Off"" setting was incorrectly implemented, and could cause some of the issues you encountered like ""frozen"" character etc. This will be fixed soon in the patch we'll try to push this week.
Anyway, don't hesitate to shoot us an email at support@innerspacevr.com. If you can't further progress in the game because of this issue, we'll be happy to provide you a fitting save file so you can resume your adventure! Thanks."
