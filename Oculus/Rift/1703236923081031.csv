2022-05-28 19:49:04.282507,Max_Immelmann,nice chess game,"was looking for some thing a bit different, not just a plain old chess board.  this fit the bill nicely.

could use a little more in the animations.  eg. instead of captured piece just falling in to floor, a mound of dirt (grave) covers it up, then all ""melts"" in to floor.

a version with more gore.

a good game to sit back and relax from the more physically demanding games.","Aug 10, 2019 at 5:44 PM",4, 0,"Hi Max, Thanks very much for your kind review. We really appreciate it! At this point, the game is on hold due to minimal sales and apparent lack of interest. It was a self-funded project, and the current level of sales and interest makes it difficult to invest more time and money into it.
 
Best, Tak"

Then task manager starts to lock up.  Install at your own risk, trying to figure out how to get a refund myself.  

How do you respond to a response in Oculus?  The developer seems very concerned and legitimate, I can only promise him that I am not making this up, and am nervouse to try installing it again.  If no one else is having this issue, then I have zero idea what is going on with my file.  Anyhow, ty for the response, and GL!  And no I never requested a refund or support as I cannot figure out how to in Oculus, Steam is much more user friendly in terms of an intuitive menu.  thnx again","Aug 15, 2018 at 2:51 PM",1, 0,"Hi MrFroug, I have no idea how this could happen. The version is the same one which has been there for several months. The program has nothing to do with Leapfrog. I will inquire of Oculus and see if they have any ideas.

*** UPDATE *** Please contact Oculus support and try to resolve the issue. Response from Oculus:
