They all exist within a spherical kaleidoscope of space, the rainbow stars of which can be distracting at times. There's no splash page when starting up to explain things, so the app hopes you'll have read the description or at least this review now. You can press a button to bring up the sliders and the next/previous buttons. Nothing is labeled or numbered, so you have to experiment with each slider to figure out what it might do. For Touch controls, the sliders are not nearly as responsive as you would hope they would be. Overall, this is a pretty interesting app that explores a new idea within the VR space. I just hope that it gets updated to fix the responsiveness and I would really like labels or numbers on the sliders to define what they do or at least what variable they are set at.","Jun 21, 2017 at 10:50 AM",4, 6,
