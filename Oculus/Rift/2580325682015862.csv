It s sometime very frustating, i hope it will be more accuracy in the future.
But in generally the game make me happy !! And give me the smile of my day.
I have a suggestion i will be a good idea if we create a fan group on strava ?
When i play your game i post on strava","May 28, 2021 at 11:19 PM",5, 0,"Hey JCTrickY, thank you for playing and enjoying our game ♥ Could you elaborate a little bit more about what you mean when you say accuracy of your position? Do you miss gems or hit the barrier when you don't mean to? Please keep in mind that your hands and head cannot touch the barriers or it will count as a miss.

2022-05-28 20:45:54.873907,user_of_this_name,It's alright,"I'm a beat saber guy, so I came over expecting to like this. The prospect of custom levels was exciting to me (I wanted to add songs as I bought the quest version of beat saber). I bought the game, and yes, its fun. However, the song selection is small and by custom levels, they don't mean add your own songs, they mean add your own choreography. If the song selection grew and custom songs were added, I would definitely give this 5 stars.","Apr 5, 2021 at 5:37 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 20:45:54.889864,MomBomb1,Best VR Dancing Game I've Played,"I have really enjoyed this game so much! I was looking for something fun, and with a good workout experience. The choreography is great, and the cardio is really working for me. I love the music, and hope to continue to see great music added. I researched many similar games before deciding on this one, and I'm not dissapointed with my purchase and experience. I ""play"" nearly every day. I've purchased this on two different platforms just so my kids can play it, too.","Feb 19, 2021 at 12:21 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:45:54.904825,pacxx03,One of the best rhythm games!,"I think it's one of the best rhythm games in VR. From an objective point of view, I think it's much better than well-known competitors like SynthRiders for example. Here I really have the feeling of dancing a choreography. The graphics are good and I like to play it on my PC VR but also often on my Quest (2), both versions are really good. At the beginning there were only a few songs, but some new songs has now been added since than. Still, I would like to have much more songs, especially songs like the ones that were added recently, so more pop or funky ... or RnB, I would even spend money on song packages like Beat Saber. So, a rhythm game that is not so well known, but which has the best ""I dance a choreography feeling"" of all rhythm games. Well done and thanks to the developers for this pearl!","Jan 6, 2021 at 6:03 AM",5, 7,"Hi pacxx03 - We're so glad to hear you've felt the joy of dancing while playing! That's powerful, and exactly what the two of us set out to do from the very beginning of designing this game. And personally, I'm humbled and honored that you think the choreography shines through. I've been a dancer my whole life, and choreographed for different groups and such, but never had my choreography danced on such a massive scale as this - it's incredibly fulfilling to hear that you enjoy it and that you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down ;) Thank you.

And on more songs - we hear you! We'll be releasing multiple songs at a time now, so stay tuned!

Keep dancing and having fun in VR! All the best ~Ashley"
2022-05-28 20:45:58.025478,VR4EVER,Absolutely fun cardio workout!,"I play this on the Quest2, since the freedom of movement is very important here - because you will move a lot!
Great music, awesome movements (in fact, much better than Synth Riders or Beat Saber) and you will sweat your butt of in no time!

Speaking of time: When you think you danced for like 10 minutes - and it's actually 50 minutes, you know you're in the right place.

Would love more songs as DLC to support those awesome developers, that bring so much joy into my life! Thank you!","May 3, 2021 at 1:48 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:45:58.039440,krissyagain,Fun and a decent workout,Fantastic game. I am  very not a great dancer by any strecth but this was so much fun. I hope more songs continue to be added.,"Jan 30, 2021 at 10:58 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:45:58.054400,orbital,Awesome Game,"At the moment this is my favorite fitness game and one of my favorite games to play on my Quest 2. Really love the music and the pacing, rhythm and flow. Would love it there was more tracks and maps available for DLC. Perhaps licensing some of the same electronic/dance tracks from Audica or Synth Riders would be possible? 100% recommended.","Dec 29, 2020 at 10:57 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:45:58.083323,jamesd256,Just buy it already.,"This is an early stage review.   For me, this is now the go-to rhythm game on Quest and CV1.  I don't know much about the depth or longevity of the game, but my first plays left me with a whole mind and body 'wow' experience.  I've tried this out on quite a few people alongside Beat Saber, and while the old master still has a real impact on new-to-VR gamers, the universal opinion has been that Audio Trip is the next level up.  Nothing else I've shown people puts such a smile on faces as this.  Clearly it's not just me, this game creates intense and highly pleasurable sensations.  I think it's because the game calls for a more varied and interesting series of movements.  It gets you really dancing!  Also because the play list and choreography really have been done fantastically well.  There is also a tool you can use to create your own levels.  Time will tell if the game matures, in terms of play career, multi player, etc.  But for now, what are you waiting for?","Aug 15, 2020 at 6:28 AM",5, 6,You've found the joy that we were hoping to share in this game! Thank you so much for your kind words. Keep a look out for all of our features yet to come as we continue to develop Audio Trip - we think you'll enjoy them just as much! <3
2022-05-28 20:46:01.180040,Chazmeister,Fun and gets you moving.,"I was looking for a rhythm action game that would make me move around a bit and give me a bit of an aerobic workout beyond just standing in one place and waving my arms about. This one seemed to fit the bill and it does so very well. It’s an orb catching game essentially (they’re actually triangles in this game though), but you also have to hit drums too and follow lines, as well as dodge or duck out of the way of walls. The game will have you stretching out, doing squats and dodging from side to side and give you quite a reasonable workout that will get you sweating and the heart rate up.

I play the game in a 7ft by 7ft space and pretty much never hit the sides of my area as the game does a great job of keeping it all contained within my play space and yet still manages to have me dodging about and stretching out for the corners. I’ve found forward creep is more of an issue than hitting the sides. The game does have a “Step Back” warning but it seems not to work all the time, in fact after I’ve played my first track, I never seem to notice it again during my sessions. So I’ve enabled the Guardian barrier and just have the floor space show up if I’m approaching the edges. The game scales to your height so whether you are short or tall, you should get the same level of difficulty when reaching for the orbs.

The music tracks are really good and I haven’t yet come across any that I don’t like. It has support for the free YUR Fit VR app, which you have to run from Steam, but it all works really well and has leaderboards for that in the game too.

I just play on novice difficulty levels at the moment, as despite being able to often get 100% of the orbs and stuff or very near it, and accuracy that’s generally in the 90’s in many of the tracks, the jump up from novice to regular difficulty is just too huge for me. There are other minor issues I'd like to see addressed but I appear to have hit my character count for this review, so I'll have to leave it there.","Aug 22, 2020 at 1:46 AM",5, 1,"Wow, Chazmeister - thank you so much for taking time to leave such a thorough review! We want to hear more of your thoughts as you play, since we're still developing the game.

2022-05-28 20:46:01.195998,MinouBadou,Love it <3,"Saw it pop-up a few times on the YUR.fit discord... tried the beginner was a bit too easy for me... regular is just right and expert is still a bit too hard, but we'll get there with practice. Deffo a must buy for beat saber/synth rider fans!
Love to see more songs added to it soon! I'd like to see some packs to buy so we can sponsor you guys for this great and fun game!","Jul 5, 2020 at 6:24 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:46:01.211955,RobRuffo,"Absolutely beautiful and hypnotic, but..","This is a wonderfully active and visually hypnotic game, that has your whole body moving - as such it's a rare VR game that works out not just arms and shoulders + cardio, but your legs and abs as well.  The songs are great too- real EDM tracks from known artists, and each song has a different environment.

Each song has you moving in different ways, doing different things, in a wonderful flow that matches the feel of songs WAY better than any rhythm game I have ever seen - and I have tried them all.  Same holds true for how the environments morph and shift in a way that is almost like a music video for the tracks. 

However, I rake off one star due to shortcomings that I hope will be fixed:
- No structure.  Just pick a song, select a difficulty, rinse and repeat.  I would LOVE a campaign that moved through tracks in increasing difficulty, as well as Box VR style workout set, with varying lengths and difficulty settings.  Even just a button that said ""Next song"" and would play through all the tracks in order would be better than the nothing we have now.  Come on guys, I know enough about coding to know that both of the above would be extremely easy compared to all the work you've already done here.
- There is no score recording of any kind - you have no way of knowing if you're improving between plays of songs unless you write down your score.  Again - how hard would it be to record your score and its date - so you could see your progress.
- No leaderboards
- No unlockables.  Guys (Girls?  Don;t know enough about developers) unlockable stages, tracks, etc are fun motivators.  No game design theory book would ever say different.  It goes to how humans are motivated.  This is why in a Karate class they don't just give you all belts when you show up and say ""Have fun"" - because no one would  show up for that class.  Maybe other rhythm games (except for the most popular ever - BeatSaber) have no structure of progression, but that does not mean it's a good  idea.","Apr 9, 2020 at 12:36 PM",4, 13,"Hi RobRuffo!

Thanks so much for your comments and suggestions! It’s awesome to hear you’re enjoying Audio Trip and its music, choreography, and environments. We spend SO much time on all of these things, and feedback like yours makes it all worth it.

The two of us have been working hard to address the concerns keeping us from earning your fifth star you mentioned, and wanted to touch base with you regarding our progress and plans for the future. :)

Addressed:
-    Score recording has been added! Detailed score tracking that includes information on Accuracy, Success, and Star Rating now available. 
-    Leaderboards are here! This was definitely a top priority for us to get out. Challenge your friends in local (Party) mode and claim your spot on the global leaderboards. 

Upcoming:
-    Unlockables/Achievements/Campaigns — one word: YES. We are actively working on (and incredibly excited by) this new phase of developing Audio Trip! Steam achievements, in-game achievements, unlockables, modifiers, and challenges are all things we have been brainstorming about and working on recently. In fact, we’d love to hear more ideas from players like you on the things you’d like to unlock or the types of achievements or challenges you’d like to see. 

Again, thanks so much for the feedback and for playing our game!

2022-05-28 20:46:01.226915,MillsBiker,Great! I love it!,"This game is so much fun! It took me just a few minutes to learn how to use it and then I was having a great time! It will definitely get you moving and I was actually getting a cardio workout using it. I did not think that the easiest level was too hard. It felt fast initially, but after two songs I was getting the hang of it and was able to make it to the end of the songs without getting a game over termination. This game redefined my image of what it means to be a gamer. I had pictured gaming as an unhealthy, sedentary activity where you eat junk food and gain weight. But with Audio Trip I am getting a cardio workout.","Apr 7, 2020 at 8:34 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:46:01.241875,Manydoors,Put on your trip shoes and dance.,"I must own every vr beat games going but Audio Trip is the ONLY one that has me actually dancing.
They have very cleverly positioned the targets in such a way that not only does it keep with the beat but has you dance along with the beat.  Even the mighty Beat saber can't do this as it has a tendensy to throw blocks at you in the name of challenge that have nothing to do with the music.  The result being you are knocked completely out of the rythem.
Audio trip is the game I have been looking for and I hope the developers keep taking the game to new hights.
Audio Trip looks great sounds great and does the job it was intended to do.  Makes you dance like your life depended on it.
At the time of this review the game only costs £15.  That makes it a steal.  Grab it and disco the nights away.","Feb 27, 2020 at 8:29 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:46:04.325627,Yangsters,You won't regret it!,"This is my favorite game right now.  It is so incredibly fun, I play it every day. I specifically use Oculus for exercise, and Audio Trip makes exercising, getting my heart rate up, etc. super fun.  I've played Beat Saber, On Shape, Beat the Blitz, Box VR... This is the game I keep returning to.  You can play this in a relaxed way, where you just touch the gems, or you can use it more like a fun exercise program like me by punching the gems with a lot of strength. I turn on my Apple Watch exercise app, and I can get my heart rate over 140 - 170 if I really exert myself, all the while totally enjoying myself.","Feb 10, 2020 at 1:09 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 20:46:04.355547,mykgerard,Adjustment needed on skill levels,This game looks like it has a lot of potential but I found myself very frustrated. The beginner mode is rather difficult and regular is extremely hard. This game makes synth riders and beat saber look like a piece of cake comparatively. Those games have difficulty levels which are more fair. If the creators of this game dial down their difficulty levels and maybe add one more on the top this game will be more inclusive and likely much more successful.,"Nov 27, 2019 at 11:25 PM",3, 10,"Hi mykgerard, thanks so much for your feedback and playing our game! We heard you and others about the difficulty on beginner, and have dialed down the speed and choreography for that level especially, and have also included a couple of ways players can practice - including 'No Fail' and creating custom copies of any of our choreography with whatever gem speed you like! We also are prioritizing modifiers, including gameplay speed, as we continue to develop the game. We hope you find any and all of those options helpful. Thanks so much! <3 Kinemotik"
2022-05-28 20:46:04.370507,Tony_Digital,Regular is Impossible,This is a great exercise game but why is the regular option so hard. That option is impossible to do which shouldn't be the case when it's just one level up.  Regular is dialed up way too high. I don't even want to know what expert is like. I enjoy everything about this game except that drastic change from beginning to regular. I have a feeling that whoever made that option that hard can't even do it.,"Nov 24, 2019 at 12:52 AM",4, 5,"Hi Tony_Digital - this is Ashley, one of the two developers making the game, and the choreographer of all the trips. We've put a lot of work into adjusting the speeds and moves of each trip so that there is a natural progression between all levels of each song, and also now included many options to practice trips, including 'No Fail' and making a custom copy of any trip to adjust the gem speed. And we're also definitely going to be releasing modifiers soon, one of which will be gameplay speed. So hopefully those help! Also, haha yes, I do dance all of the trips, but I created them all, so of course they're easier for me :) They're definitely possible though! In fact, the dancer in the game, if you turn on that option, is actually me mocapped dancing the trips! Anyway, thanks again for the comments, and I hope you keep enjoying as we develop more! - Ashley Cooper"
2022-05-28 20:46:04.385467,JonnyMoo,Good but not five star... Yet.,"I do like the game but with the triangles that you have to hit in a certain direction feel to strict like i have to hit them hard and in a very specific direction which ruins the flow. And the walls are also a little unforgiving. There are also not very good indications of what i'm doing wrong so when I fail I don't know why, good indication helped me get to expert+ in beat saber a lot faster. As the creator you need to help train the player as they go even when there not in the tutorial, if you guys added better indication, more forgiving walls and make it so i don't need to hit the triangles so hard I would recommend this game. But for now good job!","Nov 17, 2019 at 5:15 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 20:46:07.491160,prvncher,Fantastic beat saber alternative,"Unlike beatsaber, this game makes you really feel like you're dancing - and boy does it feel good. Also unlike beat saber, there is really great licensed music that comes with the game!

After a few runs on regular, I set the game to No Fail and tried out expert. 
This game makes you move all over your space, so ensure it's big enough! When you're in the game, it flows incredibly well - much more than any other rythm game I've tried.

It's also a fantastic workout - for which you don't even realize it's happening.
After one song on expert, my Apple Watch thought I was doing out for a run.

Give it a chance!","Oct 25, 2019 at 9:31 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:46:07.506120,ParadiseDecay,Dance like a Pro!,"My Initial Thoughts:
I've had the pleasure to play some really great Beat Saber alternatives this month and Audio Trip is one of them. This game will have you dancing in time with the music as you reach for those notes and also keep you fit in the process.
It also sports a cool soundtrack with tracks from Lady Gaga to Benni Bennasi and the beat matching is spot on! 
If you like games like Beat Saber and Audica, here's another one to add to your list.
