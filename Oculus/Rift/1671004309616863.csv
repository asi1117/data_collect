2022-05-28 15:44:36.382323,OoaliceoO,Very touching experience,"Bring some time, this is a slow, meditative experience featuring the audio recordings of professor John M. Hull who became blind in the middle of his life. Some of these thoughts moved me and made me think. The experience has 6 scenes, amongst them a scene in a park, a scene illustrating ""panic"", a scene in a house and the choir, which I enjoyed most.

Note that it does require touch controllers for some scenes, even though not stated on the store page.","Jun 1, 2020 at 3:59 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:44:36.425208,Matt_MR,Absolutely wonderful,"I was instantly captivated by this.  Very immersive, powerful and moving.  The way the visuals evolve as the narrator describes his experience is quite magical.  One of my favourite things I've ever done in VR (and I've done quite a lot!)","Apr 3, 2020 at 5:01 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:44:39.586752,Hbharrison,cant play,It doesnt say it requires touch controllers. But it does. Wish they would have stated this before i purchased as i only have a gamepad at the moment.,"Jan 27, 2019 at 3:04 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 15:44:39.601713,meilensteindigital,A must have Experience !,"Stunning how they used VR to let u dive into a world you  don´t like to be in reality. I think it´s the right way and a good example why VR is so special and where of for what it could be used. VR is not just gaming, it´s a new universe.","Jun 27, 2018 at 5:19 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:44:39.616672,SodaBoy1000,,Thank you for this beautiful and enlightening experience. As a person suffering from degenerative hearing loss I associated with many of your thoughts... wishing you peace wherever you are!,"Jun 21, 2018 at 6:56 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:44:42.746302,proven28,Beautifully done,"The combination of his actual recordings with the visual representations of sounds in VR felt perfectly done.  As someone with a child who lost most of her vision at 4 yrs old, this was a deeply personal experience as well.  This is definitely worth a few dollars and 15 minutes for those looking for a different type of VR journey.","Dec 8, 2017 at 1:30 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:44:42.760264,that_lightworker,Very well done!,"This experience demonstrates VR capability of spatial audio.  You can selectively hear individual sounds depending on which way you turn your head, making for a life-like auditory experience.  It felt like a good fifteen minutes or so, was meditatively relaxing, and had a few nice interactive prompts.  Also the integration of this man's story with form-mimicking light particles was very professionally done!  Great buy!","Dec 8, 2017 at 8:34 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:44:42.775225,ericobnn,Incredible!,"This experience consists of 6 sections of about 3 minutes each, tacking different aspects of the experience of blindness. Mr. Hull's remarks are really insightful. Even though I almost never cry with media and stories in general, by the end of this I was crying. It's a powerful story! Absolutely worth paying for, even though it's short. Props to the dev team!","Dec 11, 2017 at 2:51 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:44:42.789188,Anarchae,Sound Issue,While the concept is interesting I have an issue on my system with Soundblaster Z  5.1 sound card.  I can barely hear the narration if at all.

2022-05-28 15:44:42.804147,PatHightree,Phenomenal,"His recordings are very eloquent and powerful. 
The VR experience puts you in his shoes and beautifully illustrates the message.
I'm a VR dev too and was worriend I'd be distracted by tech, 
it brought tears to my eyes.","Dec 9, 2017 at 7:46 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:44:45.895878,mrboeien.oculus,One of the best VR-experiences,"Very interesting, immersive and emotional experience... one of the best I had so far (and I've sampled a whole lot, over the last year). On one point I actually experienced some slight panic myself (but panic wasn't the main ingredient here... its about perceiving reality in another way and going through the process). Highly recommended.","Jan 3, 2018 at 11:18 PM",5, 5,
