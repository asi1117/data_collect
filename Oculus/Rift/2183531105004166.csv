2022-05-28 19:44:22.932114,PicoPlanetDev,Amazing Rock Pinball game,"UPDATE: Just wanted to say that the dedicated developer's recent updates have improved Metal Multiball tremendously, and I highly reccomend purchasing this game if you are still on the fence!

Cool game!  The pin ball physics (motion) is realistic and immersive.  The arcade-style game play mixed with a heavy metal beat is awesome.  I can't wait to get better at this game, improve my bouncing abilities and discover new levels, alternate music and how many multi-balls can be played at once. Any arcade gamer should definitely give this a try - I think that it is worth the $3!","Sep 8, 2020 at 4:00 AM",5, 1,Thank you PicoPlanetDev!
2022-05-28 19:44:22.948072,nukkuepuss,Light ‘em up or die trying!,"Metal Multiball puts you in control of the paddles that provide force for the pinball, using the Touch triggers as you’d expect. Heavy-metal music plays along with the fast-paced action on the stage, with the band, equipment and rigging acting as the static targets.

The twist is that you can also point-and click the ball with your virtual hands as they’ve turned into paddles as well. This mechanic requires skill - like all the best games it’s easy to pick up but difficult to master - giving the title longevity by rewarding the player with higher levels and a rotating metal soundtrack. And when the Multiball of the title is unlocked you’re going to need some of that skill.

Metal Multiball™ has avoided the trap of trying to be UltimateVRPinball™. Instead it confidently delivers a solidly playable pinball mechanic with a metal theme. A low-cost indie that hits all the right buttons.","May 10, 2020 at 3:32 PM",5, 3,"Thank you milliepuss, not only for the rating but also for taking the time to create a well written review. You inspire a boost in creative energy for the next upgrade.  Cheers, Steve Hinan."
2022-05-28 19:44:22.964029,uno.aphex,It's okay,"First of all I really like the concept but I do have a lot of issues with the game. 
Firstly the camera is pretty bad
I wouldn't call this Metal, it's more like Classic Rock. 
Animations are pretty stiff and its sort of hard to keep your eyes on the ball. 
It wasn't expensive so I can't complain too much but There needs to be a bit more pinball and metal about your game..about pinball and metal.. As it stands its more like.. Racketball and hardrock. It's alright. Pretty mediocre.","Mar 5, 2020 at 9:34 AM",2, 0,"Thank you uno.aphex, I have recently uploaded a significant update and I hope you play again!"

I don't care what ppl say but this game is better than beat saber by far. this is very fun to play. LOVE IT","Jan 28, 2020 at 5:14 AM",5, 1,"🤘🤘
Thanks wirelitesoft.dev!
Better than beat saber by far, I agree!"

2022-05-28 19:44:26.113684,Jazmin,I love it,"I feel like I'm a goalie at a metal show trying to keep a human hamster ball from getting on stage and it's awesome. It's a bit hard too which is good. I like a challenge. It's also funny! When the ball hits an object, you'll hear a voice say what that object is, like ""drums!"" if you hit the drummer and ""sign!"" if you hit the sign lol it's a good kind of silly","Apr 3, 2019 at 2:24 PM",5, 4,"Thanks Jazmin!
A human hamster ball, a wonderful future update!
Cheers,

2022-05-28 19:44:26.129641,dunkygamer,What a Pickup!,"I love getting in on the ground floor of these awesome indie games! I thought this one was complete but it still has updates to come and an inspired Dev, and I can't wait to see how it gets even better!  Very natural pinball controls and concepts and just a great game all around.","Mar 18, 2019 at 2:17 PM",5, 3,"Thank you dunkygamer! 
I'm working on adding new voice actors, motion captured musicians and (hopefully) multiplayer! 
Cheers, Steve Hinan"
2022-05-28 19:44:29.233936,CYBL4DE,When metalhead wants to chill,"I love sitting and relaxing with this game. Poking the ball around with good background music.

Pros:
- easy to play
- HEADBANG COUNTER!!!
- simple yet nice graphics (looks like gig in Sin City)
- glowing touch controlers are looking awesome
- good music

Cons:
-uncomfortable intro! Dude, you are too close. GET OFF MY PERSONAL SPACE!
- repetitive after some time
- leaderboards display cities, not player names","Jan 22, 2019 at 3:57 PM",5, 7,"Thanks CYBL4DE.
Great feedback about the intro video being too close.
Edited response:  I removed the intro video from the startup sequence.
Cheers, Steve Hinan"
2022-05-28 19:44:29.249893,juaninja,Fiery indie VR pinball game!,"When I found METAL VR PINBALL I was immediately drawn in. There's no game out there like it and it has all original music by the developer and his friend. There's a lot of hard work that went into this game and it shows. 

Hit that skill shot, angle up playfield targets, headbang, score multiball, and headbang some more! Get up on the leaderboard and enjoy seeing your avatar in front of you in the song selection room. My sick Oculus armor looks good in METAL VR PINBALL! (Haven't seen this done before!)

I really enjoyed the different venues and look forward to seeing the game evolve over time. I'm a fan of rhythm games, but METAL VR PINBALL gets me and my dark soul! Can't wait for new songs and would totally follow on Spotify!","Jan 25, 2019 at 3:22 AM",5, 7,"Thank you juaninja! 
Your review has me stoked to create faster.  You are awesome! 
Cheers, Steve Hinan"
2022-05-28 19:44:29.263856,citizen12,Still love this game,Started playing this on the Go and now have it for Rift.  Nice work with the adaptation for touch controllers! Love how the only way to keep the music coming is to keep smacking that ball around.  Would love to get some new music!,"Jan 17, 2019 at 10:02 AM",5, 5,"Thank you citizen12!  
Special thanks for playing on 2 Oculus platforms, you are awesome.  
Currently working on song #8 called 'Tiamat', coming soon!"
