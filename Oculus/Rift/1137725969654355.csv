I didnt really like the control system, it would have been nice if the coffin stayed still when you moved around too because if you move around too much the coffin moves with you and it doesnt give you the feel of being inside the coffin. The clues are OK difficulty, I dont think you will get stuck on this. I would say the one thing they really need to sort out though is how small everything is! my body looked like I was a small child. However a fun little experience with OK graphics and a great jumpscare.
Check out my video and see for yourself.
