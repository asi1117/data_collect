2022-05-28 18:15:07.728764,FastLawyer,Not sure why so many low ratings,"This game works fine and it's free.  It's an escape puzzle game type with cinematic cut scenes.  Touch controllers work, but I suggest a roomscale setup so you can easily reach objects (this is not a point and click game unless you choose the gaze option!).  The cinematics are good.  My main complaint is that you move very slowly, painfully slow.  However, the puzzles are pretty logical.  The first room puzzle is basically given to you.  You just have to guess the lockpad combination.  If you pay attention to your surroundings, that should not be difficult at all.  The second room puzzle involves thinking a bit about how to get the radio working.  It should be pretty easy to figure out.  The only hard part is that it is timed so you do have to find necessary items quickly.  But you get to start right over and the end of time, so it's not a big deal if you ""lose.""  I would only give this 4 stars, but because of so many low star reviews, I decided to bump up to 5 to counterweight those idiots reviewing this low.","Nov 16, 2017 at 11:59 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:15:07.745718,grekb,Seems like it needs some work,"UPDATE 10-11-2017
I recomment to NOT INSTALL this app since it seems to be poor coded. EVERYTIME you run the app it creates a new ""Program Files"" folder in your c:/ drive and who knows what else it does to your pc...
Old review:
For those trying first time, you will know there is interaction with an item when you see your finger move. You interact with the trigger button.  Graphics are pretty nice. The videos were problematic, maybe because of bad quality they make you dizzy. Also there is no sound at all... Its a nice idea, i hope you can work on it more","Oct 12, 2017 at 4:51 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 18:15:07.761676,XanadoX,little point and click adventure,"It's based on a TV program, that it's like NBC's Timeless (NBC copied it, http://deadline.com/2017/05/timeless-lawsuit-settled-shawn-ryan-eric-kripke-sony-nbcu-1202103021/ ). Netflix is now producing the original, so expect it to arrive worldwide.

For me it's a better experience with xbox controller than touch controller. 
A bomb is going to explode and prevent one agent to come from the past. You have 15 minutes to scape from the room you are and get the information needed to defuse the bomb.

No problem with the reported program files carpet here","Oct 13, 2017 at 2:55 AM",4, 0,

I really liked this one!","Jan 11, 2018 at 8:25 PM",5, 0,
