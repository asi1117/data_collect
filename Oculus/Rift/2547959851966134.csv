2022-05-28 19:46:59.198131,Dave Razor,It would be cool if the website worked,I just picked up this application. I was jazzed until I tried to click the link to install the ControlRoom Hub and Plugins. The website they link to is dead and unresponsive... Therefore rendering this application next to useless.,Dec 31 at 11:49 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:46:59.214088,Maus318,This app is not FREE,"Even its for free to here to download, its not for free and you can do nothing with it.
You need to ge to the home page Perspective and the when you logged in you can download a tool for trail, but thats not gonna work becase you need also have to buy the program self... sorry for my bad english bud i hate when i must buy when i cant try out!!","Oct 11, 2019 at 10:00 PM",1, 45,"Hi Maus318, thanks for checking out the app. Sorry you didn't have a good experience at first.  There is a standalone mode which allows you to experience how the tools perform when you connect to your DAW.  If you want to try connecting to your DAW please create an account on our website and purchase a license with the code OculusTrial1019 for a free two week trial period. If you like, it please consider revising your review. If you have any other questions or concerns please contact us at info@persp3ctive.com Thank you! -Persp3ctive"
2022-05-28 19:46:59.230046,willhensley,Mixing in Minority Report,"Wow! This is a really innovative way to interact with your Protools and Ableton sessions. I think it could be the future of music production… or atleast mixing. Being able to reach out and set the volume and placement (and DEPTH) of your tracks with spatial mixer is something that must be experienced to truly be appreciated. The VR drumpads are a blast and automating sends and levels/panning feels like working on a real console. The FX cubes can be set up to do all types of insane (and incredibly useful) things. I’m trying to incorporate it into my workflow as much as possible because I think the expressiveness it offers for automation of levels/panning/sends and anything that’s mappable to midi is SO ADDICTIVE! Having your studio layout with you in a hotel room (w/ some good headphones, laptop, and a rift) seems like it could be a creative touring dream!","Oct 17, 2019 at 7:01 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:46:59.246003,NachomanZe,Game changer for music production,"Mapping these tools with ableton is some of the most fun I’ve had coming up with new sounds. The possibilities are truly endless. If you’re into music production at all, I’d recommend checking this out and purchasing the full license to control your DAW.","Oct 14, 2019 at 12:40 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:46:59.278422,gb3724,Bought a license,The download here is pretty basic as it just lets you play with the tools in standalone mode but I picked up a license after seeing some demos online. Next level. The FX Cube is incredible in Ableton and the spatial mixer is nuts!,"Oct 12, 2019 at 5:45 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:47:02.437034,Mrs_Feathers,Testing it out,"Thought it was kinda lame, but was able to try it out. will update review when i've had more time to test it. however my questions were answered so i'll at least update 1 star to 5 stars while i test it out","Oct 22, 2019 at 5:49 AM",5, 1,"Hi mothgirlgames, thank you for your thoughtful review. ControlRoom requires an Oculus Rift(with PC) or Quest for the VR rendering but controls your Mac if you download the ControlRoom Hub from www.persp3ctive.com.  If you use the code oculustrial1019 you can download the Hub as well as the ControlRoom Channel and Master plugins to see how all these components work together to control your DAW with ultra low latency over your local network.  We have many updates coming soon which will allow you to do even more. Please take some time to check it out with your DAW and you'll see it's much more than a midi controller. Also, if you are interested in buying the software, the Hub and plugins can be purchased for a discounted price. If you have more thoughts we'd love to hear them so we can build an even better product. Please shoot us an email at info@persp3ctive.com

Thanks!

2022-05-28 19:47:02.453989,Dyslogix,,"$249 $139 ? ... It's nothing more than a VR midi controller and you want the price of a standard Ableton license for it? lol i guess some will for the novelty of it, but no, not me :) I'll stick with actual midi controllers, i don't need to sweat like a madman to create my track, the immersion will lose it's lustre eventually, but gl to those buying into it :)

Update : This has to rival DAW midi controllers, VR needs to be much better before this becomes the "" new thing ""  i just don't think VR is ready to be made a piece of production level equipment, so i believe this is way too steep a price for something that could be obsolete after a while. Maybe a party piece composer, but hours? lol thanks anyway but i'll pass. I'll use VR for the gaming side of things in short bursts, hours creating? oof i can barely spend 2 hours tops in it before having to take it off. 
Have a good one and honestly, best of luck with it :) And i do mean that sincerely.","Oct 14, 2019 at 5:33 AM",1, 12,"Hi Dyslogix, Thanks for checking out the application. The full version of ControlRoom is a DAW controller, MIDI controller and comes with a fully integrated plugin with our own DSP. The combined price of comparable hardware and software would be much greater and we think the benefits of using these tools in VR alongside your traditional workflow are great. We invite you to try a trial and see what you think. Use the code OculusTrial1019 on check out."
2022-05-28 19:47:02.468949,JakeMaymudes,It just keeps getting better and better,"The free download is fine and gives you a glimpse. But the real meat and potatoes is the pro version that’s compatible with Protools or Ableton or any DAW according to the website. Running a Mac OS session of Protools and controlling it and mixing with it in virtual reality. Now that’s bonkers. Gesturual commands, amazing. It really is wild and it’s also nice to get out of the chair and still be working on cool stuff. Also impresses the guests in the studio.","Oct 29, 2019 at 8:42 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:47:02.484907,kylecmoore,WOW,Unreal! ControlRoom has opened up a huge realm of potential with music production. I'm already finding ways to implement this into my workflow. I feel like I have a new way of expressing the feeling I want out of my production and / or mix. Already very excited to create with this!!,"Oct 12, 2019 at 5:32 AM",5, 4,
