As it started to unfold I wondered was this about the Holocaust, a war, future disaster due to climate change, Covid? And I see now it’s about Syria, but in a sense it doesn’t matter. It’s about any unnecessary man made death toll. The app itself is eerie, horrific but even beautiful at times and eye opening. A very well done artistic representation of the horrors that can be perpetrated by man.",Jan 22 at 8:28 AM,5, 0,
