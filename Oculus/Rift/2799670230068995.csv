2022-05-28 20:40:25.175732,johnnyb2012,good one,"UPDATE #3:
Just started the game, played and voilà it seems to be fixed!
I would only wish easier topmost cubes, otherwise it is good playability!
--------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE 2021 OQ2: I have not played it for a long time, but now unfortunately, my current experience is not as good as before. In custom mode I have to use lowest speed (still fast) to be playable and still not registering some of frontal straight hits, quite frustrating.. However, I like 360 degree mode. Usually first play not using vibration/haptic feedback, ok after game restart. I have not played campaign mode yet but taking back one star for not entertaining custom mode..
--------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: After releasing version 2.9.3 I am adding one more star (giving 4 stars)! I play only custom (MP3) mode with all having unlocked and with my heavy customization and it works well except few details that could be polished in next versions!
--------------------------------------------------------
Yet another rhythm based game.. You will have to probably play with game settings for a while to get the best prepared scene for your gameplay. There is a good level of customization including custom/MP3 songs and the game gets frequent updates. The developer listen to my observation/suggestions and he is constantly fixing and improving game features.. I would like it more fast paced, waiting for an update with custom speed/difficulty..","Feb 12, 2021 at 6:36 AM",4, 0,
