2022-05-28 18:55:05.198416,Markari62,Whipped the Llama!,"First, I apologize to the creators of this program. After purchasing, I had not even tried the program before writing them to see if they could make a program like the Milkdrop visualizer that comes with Winamp. Turns out that they already did it! Not exactly, but very close and well worth the money. Quite an interesting way to experience old songs. Thanks!","Feb 6, 2021 at 6:50 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:55:05.212379,libbytripp,The Visualizer I wanted!,"Made for Darkside of the moon!

The app developer on this one deserves great parise! I have looked at maybe all the music visualizers available and this one is the best by far! This is hte first time I have ever left a review for any app but just wanted to reach out and say good job. I would have given 5 stars but the menu controls seemed just a tad clunky but I'm sure I can get used to them","Sep 13, 2020 at 2:14 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:55:05.243297,dunkelhaus,For sure worth the $10,"Solid visualizer, looks great, works great!","Jul 4, 2020 at 12:42 PM",5, 2,Ever so kind of you :) Glad you like it!!!
2022-05-28 18:55:05.258256,melissachodz,Definitely not worth $10,"All it does is pretty colors, but it doesn't react to music at all. Get Mirage instead for 5 and actually reactive visuals.","Jul 2, 2020 at 7:16 AM",1, 1,"Thanks for your feedback. I put an awful lot of work into this project and can ASSURE you there's more to it than ""pretty colors"" & that the effects are quite reactive to music. Sorry you didn't enjoy the experience as much as so many others have."

2022-05-28 18:55:08.396862,TimG,This is amazing,"I love the new hand interactions, makes some of the transitions less bumpy.  I agree somewhat that cutting to the next visual is sometimes less fluid, but timing the change to a breakdown or change in music works adequately.
Have had a bit of trouble playing an MP3 using the interface as it crashes somewhat but works fine with external audio source (although I noticed that some visuals will not work with external audio).
Other than that, it truly is a wonderful experience and I really hope that you will make more visuals to add to the collection because I could spend hours dancing away to my favourite music with this VR app.
Excellent work.","Apr 3, 2019 at 1:11 PM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 18:55:08.428777,Metalsech,A Visual Treat,"Super music visualizer! Stunning variety of effects that portray the music very well indeed. As others have said it would be lovely to have smooth faded transitions between them or just a fade to black/white/texture if it's not possible to switch like that. Another idea I'd love to see implemented would be the ability to make scripts for MP3s that switch to chosen effects at set times e.g. 2.7 seconds in switch to this visual, at the chorus at 22.3 seconds in switch to that visual etc. This would essentially allow the creation of music videos to go with fave songs. What you reckon dev?","Mar 24, 2019 at 7:43 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:55:08.451715,GreaseNoice,Great app. Has anyone else seen the man?,Really crasy and fun visualizer. Has anybody else seen the man though? We were watching through it for abit and we saw something i've never seen and I have like an hour on here. But i swear god there was one effect that ive never seen before where there was a person standing in front of me that was black and featureless,"Jan 26, 2019 at 12:49 PM",5, 8,"ROTFL! Thanks so much! I'm not sure about ""the man"", but if you see him again grab a capture & let me know: goodfootgames@gmail.com. That said, I'm wondering if I didn't accidentally leave one of my ""dancers"" in there & that's what you saw. I was experimenting with a few things that didn't quite work out to my satisfaction before release, so they were set aside. If I missed one though (and knowing me, it's likely), that might be what you saw. Let me ask you this, was it dancing? Email me and let me know. I'm ever so curious. :D"
2022-05-28 18:55:11.549430,stormleader,Wohooo!,"That's a good one! I really like the visualisations. You can just completely immerse and danse, relax and meditate. Nice work!","Mar 4, 2019 at 11:58 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:55:11.565387,ElCuco68,WOW !!,"I've tried every visualizer in the Oculus and Steam stores, and this one is pretty much the best! I would like to second another reviewer's request for the ability to stay at an effect that you like (important when in, um..certain states), and it would also be pretty cool to be able to choose different types of fireworks and effects to shoot out of your fingers when you pull the triggers.  Another visualizer has this (the name eludes me at present), and it really adds to the experience. I wonder if there's a way to fly around in this virtual ""room""?  Other than that; perfection!","Jan 12, 2019 at 1:18 AM",5, 1,"You're ever so kind. I have a complete rework in the works, if you will, and will be including a better interface, controls, more effects & more toys. I really wish I knew how to approach the ""stay"" feature you guys are requesting, and I totally understand, but it's going to take me some thinking and tinkering to sort out. That said, I'll do my best to include something along those lines as quickly as I'm able to work it up & out. As for locomotion, most of the existing visuals are meant to be enjoyed from a central point, but I do want to create some explorable environments as well, so stay tuned. Ever, ever so glad you're enjoying my work. I'm a solo dev & this was my very first VR project. More to come!!! :D"
2022-05-28 18:55:11.581345,D0NIC,Amazing!!! But needs more content!,All said in headline. Great visualizer! Works perfectly with some substances and good music. :),"Feb 15, 2019 at 5:27 AM",5, 1,"Ever so glad you're enjoying it! I do have an update coming together with lots more effects, toys, a better interface, etc. I am only one guy though, and I'm currently juggling quite a bit. Stay tuned & thanks so much!!! :D"

2022-05-28 18:55:11.611265,gayface_johnson,"Amazing visualizer, however...","To the dev: could you implement a way to make the visuals transition smoother? Is it even possible? As it is they just suddendly cut to the next visual which can be really jarring in particular states if you know what i mean. Also, as cool as it is to have the texture maps change to the music, could you implement a way lock the texture? I don't mean locking the scene transition, i know you can do that already, i mean actually stop the textures from changing to the music. It would really help to delve into the music while on acid. Thanks dev!","Aug 20, 2018 at 2:50 AM",5, 8,"Thanks so much for your feedback! My apologies for the sudden visual transitions. I'd originally tried to implement a fading system between them, but it was buggy and unreliable so it's been set aside for revision and inclusion in a future update. I'll do my best to have it properly included in a future release. As for the textures, I completely understand but will need to consider just how to go about implementing it as I'd need to allow you some way to choose which texture(s) are included. There are two effects that ""sort of"" do what you're after in that they pick a main texture at the start of the visualization and don't change that main image until the effect is reloaded (one is a spherical kaleidoscope and the other is more of a box). If you lock one of these effects and then choose Next/Previous effect from the radial menu, it should change the main image on command. Not terribly elegant, I know, but I hope it will do until I can get some improvements in place. If you've any other suggestions, feel free to email me at: goodfootgames@gmail.com. Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 18:55:14.688035,WG1,Music Visual Essential,"Favorite music visualizer atm. One of the unique features is the texture maps changing to the music (instead of just changeing colors and shapes like most do). High resolution and detail keep the sequences interesting. Best laser toy so far, allowing you to ""paint"" with tracing and latency.  Great list of FX for a new release, thanks!
Feature Request Please: I love the FX bomb throw toy, but the gravity makes it drop so fast it ends up too far below at your feet. Can you please reduce the gravity so that the color bomb can explode in view. Thanks again, great work !","Jul 27, 2018 at 6:35 PM",5, 5,"Thanks so much for your kind words & for your suggestion! I'll be sure to make adjustments to the kaleidoscope ""grenades"" in the next update. If there's ever anything else I can do to be of assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me: goodfootgames@gmail.com"
2022-05-28 18:55:14.702995,thoiter,Very trippy.,"The best app of this type that I've tried. Some very nice visual effects here that make music a much more interesting and immersive experience.
Developer was very helpful in troubleshooting some audio problems with my PC which were preventing the program from running.","Jul 21, 2018 at 1:57 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:55:14.717955,Shockerz1000,Cool!,"""Mindblowing"" is an accurate, if not literal, description of this fun eperience. Good to see a developer tuned in to and responsive to users as well....
great work!","Dec 9, 2018 at 8:30 AM",5, 1,Ever so kind of you! Thrilled to hear that you're enjoying the visualizer! :) I have an update in the works & hope you enjoy it even more then.
