2022-05-28 17:22:51.073676,Red_Go,somewhere between for kids and adults,"I like the concept of the game.  It's very polished game with such small volume.  It was fun experience at first however... this game feels like it's in somewhere between for kids and adults.  The design and animation itself is very childish but the actual theme (story) of the game is for grownups. (as the protagonist of this game is an adult, my daughter didn't understand the story of this game).  The puzzles would be too difficult for kids but not so complicated for adults.  My 10 years old daughter was only able to solve the first puzzle by herself.  I finished this game in about an hour and I don't think I'll play it again.  It was great for just one time experience.  I'm not saying it's a bad game but it should have more contents to be priced 15 dollars. 

If you want a smile on your face for an hour with sweet memories of your childhood, this game would be a good choice.  If you're looking for something for your children, I wouldn't recommend it.","Jul 22, 2020 at 8:33 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 17:22:51.088635,JamesDWestoby,Ridiculously cute,"Shortish but seriously you HAVE to see this. It is quite amazing how much can be built into a simple structure (yes, I know it's not limited by reality). Would have been nice to be able to move a bit further away - VERY in your face! But just the solidity of the 'toys' - storyline was nicely done too - not too smaltzy pitched perfect. Worth a tenner? Definitely.","May 30, 2020 at 9:17 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 17:22:51.102598,JLN0910,cute and relaxing puzzle game,"Very much enjoyed this, though it is short to play thru, it was still a fun experience, please do more like this! : )","Apr 23, 2020 at 1:32 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:22:51.117558,Desynchronize,"Charming, Sweet, Very Short","This game is great for children or if you have young children who love to watch what you're doing on the screen.  Each scene is beatifully crafted with adorably animated characters.  It feels sort of remiscent of playing with a snowglobe and it engages creative thinking with clever puzzles.  I highly recommend this game.  

My four year old can't yet use a HMD, but she loves watching what my son and I are doing and backseat driving.  So we put the sound on the computer speakers and let her play a very active role in this one, and she was full of giggles.  My only dissappointment was that we burned through it in one session.  For the kids though, it has a bit of replay value.","Jun 4, 2020 at 11:54 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:22:51.132518,larsonmattr,Good for finding secrets,"This game has a beautiful animation style, beautiful scenes, and a nice audio narration that matches the world. I've played it on both the Rift-S and Quest, and I prefer it on the Rift-S because it can let the quality shine even more. The puzzles are really interesting and overall it is a great game. I play it with my kid and on the Rift-S we can see on the PC screen what the other one is doing and give hints. Really fun. Great developers!","Dec 15, 2019 at 10:45 AM",5, 15,"Thank you so much, great to hear your kid liked it as well!"
2022-05-28 17:22:54.259156,RuneSR2,Solid VR Childhood Dreams,"While this game may not be long, the quality is top notch. The PCVR version has much higher texture resolution and post effects compared to the Quest, so this game feels like a true PCVR game in every way. 
The polish is perfect and the game is magical, much like Luna. Graphics are amazing, maybe Stormland and Asgard's Wrath are better, but no other game looks more detailed than this gem. There really aren't any graphics settings, but I got solid 90 fps forcing super sampling 2.0 with a GTX 1080, and I'm blown away by the detailed graphics. Using CV1 you're very close to all in-game objects and this greatly minimizes the CV1 SDE - to a point where I thought it's not far from my Index. It probably has to do with eye accommodation, but SDE primarily gets pronounced using CV1 when looking at very distant objects - and you really don't do that in this game. In short, it's one of the visually most impressive games I've tried using the CV1.
Of course this isn't even close to action, it's rather a small puzzle game that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. You can play either sitting or standing, there're buttons for recentering. Controls are much like in Luna and Moss, you don't have fingers but it all works flawlessly. This is one VR gem that should be in everyone's library - it you like the genre.","Nov 15, 2019 at 5:56 AM",5, 15,"Thank you so much for sharing this, we are really happy to hear how much you like the game!"
2022-05-28 17:22:54.275113,ParadiseDecay,A Relaxing and Charming Puzzler Diorama!,"My Initial Impressions:
I have to admit I am a massive fan of Fast Travel Games who have made some incredible VR experiences so far and I'm also a massive fan of Diorama style games like this.
This game is oozing production values and is more of a relaxing style puzzler with some great characters and animations.
This is also a great showcase piece to show you kids or the younger generation as well as new people to VR.

2022-05-28 17:22:54.305033,IbegU2Rift,"Amazing experience, but short","One of my best experiences in VR, i would give it 5 stars. but will give you 4, cause i think 20 bucks, is a bit steep for a 30 min game.
But it is great.","Dec 12, 2019 at 7:22 AM",4, 1,"H, thanks for sharing and happy to hear you liked it! The game is not 20 bucks but 15, and if you finished it in 30 minutes you must be really good at puzzlers as it seems to last between 1-2 hours for most people:-)"
