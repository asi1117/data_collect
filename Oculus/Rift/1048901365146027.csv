Get the message ""TVOEC cannot download, contact Oculus support."" Support told me to write you guys.  Worked just fine when first installed over a year ago.   Hopefully you can help resolve the issue with Oculus.",May 1 at 12:56 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 17:07:49.844142,TheReclusiveGamer,Don't install,this game won't even install and neither Oculus nor the Developers will address this...there's been alot of people experiencing the same exact issues...it looks like the reviews on here are being cherry picked etc this isn't right,Apr 28 at 4:29 PM,1, 3,
2022-05-28 17:07:49.858105,GuppiePooh,LaPew,"great mystry game.  The graphics are great and the interaction with the clues build the suspence.  My touch controler worked perfect. The game requires a 
lot of thought. One of the best games I have found so far.","Jun 20, 2018 at 11:03 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 17:07:49.873064,Worpath,,"Do not buy!  VR developer quit and there are bugs about half way through that will likely permanently stop you from continuing just after your refund point.  Beautiful game with lots of potential.  I loved it until the game would crash every time a certain critical event in the story would fire and turning to google there are many with same unresolvable problem and confirmation developer will never fix.  If you can't resist, play on desktop.","Apr 5, 2018 at 12:40 PM",1, 33,
2022-05-28 17:07:49.889022,durtyrico,This game is broken!!,"Once i started the game, I noticed that the center camera was off which throws the game off due to the fact that you have to look at certain things in the world and match them up, and these things are no where near where they would usually be which makes the game pretty much unprogressable from the very beginnning. The site says that the main VR developer on the team left and they have discontinued fixing any of the issues going forward. Therefore I have no idea why this game is still here its a broken mess thats been givin up on and these people are still selling it. This is ridiculous, I want my money back!","Apr 4, 2018 at 2:29 AM",1, 21,
2022-05-28 17:07:53.026630,RuneSR2,Larger than life! Works perfectly in VR!,"So we've got Lone Echo, Robinson the Journey and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as the 3 best Rift games, right? Well, maybe not, Ethan Carter isn't for everyone. Ethan Carter is a sinister and bloody game, and it's certainly not a game for kids. And as said early in-game, ""this game will not hold your hands"". Then again that sentence would be even more true for Obduction ;-)
Ethan Carter is probably the most beautiful Rift game of all, to some degree the scenery reminds me a bit of the game Alan Wake. Ethan Carter is an experience much like ""What Remains of Edith Finch"". It's also a great adventure game, and I'd even consider this game to be art. Even with super sampling at 2.0 graphics were smooth as butter (GTX 1080 oc'ed to 2100 MHz boost and 11 GHz ram, i7 7700K 4.5 GHz cpu and 16GB PC3200) - ok, I deactivated antialiasing, because you don't need that with super sampling at 2.0. Touch controls are nicely implemented - you really don't need hands in this game, you'll see, just give the game a try. You've got full locomotion and smooth turning, but can choose more comfortable controls if preferred. And ""always run"" just requires holding a button on a Touch controller. The only problem I've observed was that subtitles are placed too low in VR, so I can't read them - the problem seemed to start the second time I launched the game.  
I had this game on my wantlist for long, because I didn't want to pay $30. Now I feel kind of bad, I should have paid $30 for this gem of a game - even $60 would be a steal. This is not just a game, it's an entrance to another hauntingly beautiful and nightmarish world; welcome to the Vanishing of Ethan Carter in VR!
Update: Looking in specific directions to match up words is working perfectly in VR - I don't understand some of the negative reviews in here, the game is working flawlessly, I've completed the game in VR - a few times I did think there were errors in the game, but it was just me not looking hard enough for clues!","Apr 14, 2019 at 7:13 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 17:07:53.040593,elliotttate,Beautiful!,"TOUCH CONTROLS DOES WORK. I'll write a full review later, but I mainly wanted to let people know how to use Touch Controls. 

In games that say ""Gamepad with Touch Controller"" that means the touch controller emulating an Xbox One controller. One limitation of the emulator is that it can't have a controller plugged in if you want to use the touch controller. Unplug the controller (or disconnected it) and you'll be good to go with the Touch Controlls.","Mar 1, 2018 at 2:14 AM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 17:07:56.178201,csomi,Amazing landscapes,"I have never played so realistic game like this one. The scenery is breathtaking. Just ambulating and enjoying what a wonderful places are found. Brilliant map editing, fantastic feeling and sound atmosphere, very talented developers! I have a little problem with the free moving system so I have to use teleporting instead. Unfortunately this not free to go everywhere implementation you can just teleport to predefinied spots. If it was free-teleport-to-everywhere, I would give six stars but so I can give just 5 stars. 
Very-very impressive game!","Jun 23, 2017 at 9:58 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 17:07:56.209118,neuro27,Keep Coming Back for More,"Throughout the massive wilderness you will mostly be walking about hoping for some clue on where to go next. But at least you always stumble across something new to discover or amazing to look at, sure you feel alone in the game, but also happy to be there. I definitely had to use a guide, as I got lost quite a bit. While I did find myself just walking around aimlessly the beautiful scenery kept me company. I have, to be honest and tell you that by the end of the game I was no longer interested in the story line, I was just happy exploring. I lot of people complain that there isn’t much gameplay length on this game because I think a lot of people rush through it, not necessarily taking the time to enjoy the sights, sounds and story line. I think this game is what you make it and I made it a beautiful adventure with new surprises around every corner…and I enjoyed every moment of it.","May 21, 2017 at 12:43 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 17:07:56.238041,kgian76,Really beautiful,This is a great game. Really beautiful graphics and sound that transport you in the game. Puzzles are logical and easy. The game is a little short but I got it in a sale and for the price it was totally worth it. It is one of the most polished and fun titles for the rift.,"Apr 5, 2017 at 4:59 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:07:59.339744,joesel22,sick,"I literally got sick playing this game. Graphics  is great though, but I'll still give it 1 star just because it is unplayable for me.","Apr 10, 2017 at 9:32 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 17:07:59.353707,Greyhawk101,No Nausea,"This game is very atmospheric, the graphics are amazing and for once you can actually MOVE!! I found that just using the left joystick and walking where you look gave me no nausea at all. I then used the right joystick a little at first so i could get used to it. Now I can use both with no issues at all. I don't even get a hint of nausea. You have to figure out whats best - take it slow. I hope all games are as good as this one. One issue - just remember if you press a button and get a black screen - you may be looking in the wrong area!","Jan 2, 2017 at 7:25 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:07:59.368667,kamiklase,Game can not be completed,"Warning! The game can not be completed in 'free movement mode'. If you start in this movement mode, you cannot return to 'teleport movement mode' (you teleport from one position to the next instead of walking with the joystick of your gamepad). You have to start all over again. When I got stuck after completing more than half of the game, I looked at all the comments on Steam / Reddit, and more people reported this exact problem. The developer has reacted to these messages and told that the VR developer has left the company and these bugs will not be crushed. I found a clever tip and could bypass the first bug, but then got stuck at a point further into the game. 
Please keep in mind that this is some kind of ""David Lynch"" story, where it is impossible to understand the different layers of the story. You can discuss forever what actually happened, and some people do so on the internet.
I had some small problems with moving through houses, which could make you woozy. I had no problems outside the buildings. The graphics outside building are also much better, you get a strange feeling in a building.","Nov 24, 2016 at 4:34 AM",3, 14,
2022-05-28 17:07:59.386620,porco556,Here comes the vomit...,"Oh my god, the controller makes me 100x more sick that the version of Redux I have with mouse/keyboard support.  I run at a full 90 FPS (with full detail + 130% scaling and GPU still only at 45%).  A little more detail as well would be nice for us with better video cards.

Great game/narrative, but the VR experience needs more options (like bring back mouse and keyboard and more graphics options).

TO be fair, the game does offer a ""teleport"" mode a la early days of Myst where you magically appear on the dot you click on.  I guess modern terms this can be called the Google Street View of Ethan Carter.","Dec 21, 2016 at 12:09 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:07:59.407563,zenshin,,"This gorgeous game could be one of the great VR titles, if only they'd make a few concessions to the medium. They appear to have largely dumped a VR camera in a PC game, and as you would expect, it's a recipe for motion sickness. Winding your way up and down stair cases may leave you shaking your head, wondering how hard it would really be to add a teleport system. It's a shame because the atmosphere and scenery is beautiful and haunting.","Oct 30, 2016 at 5:27 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 17:08:02.527219,karrtoon,Great graphics,"This experience is nearly photorealistic which gives me some of that ""presense"" feeling and would highly recommend it for that. 

The only major downside is the gamepad stick turning makes me kind of woozy, so I would recommend using a swivel chair and just turn your whole body. Even with that though it can create some nausea for me, because when I slightly look left or right when turning my body the camera still moves a little left and right. (like I'm swimming)

I am hoping when the touch comes out the devs could maybe update the locomotion to be more like the SteamVR game ""Onward"" In that game you can look anywhere with your head while traveling forward, but the games knows where you body is facing by where the controllers are pointing. You would have to try it out to understand, but it feels very natural and doesn't make me as nauseated as swivel chair turning does in this.

I doubt this will ever be updated again, but just a thought for the devs in case they are reading. We don't even need full touch support, just matching what onward is doing would go a long way.

I give this 4 stars, buy it if you have an iron stomach only. If you can tolerate it be prepared to be blown away by the amazing graphics.","Jul 15, 2016 at 4:12 PM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 17:08:02.542179,AtlasP,Absolutely Beautiful,"Absolutely beautiful, some of the best outdoor graphics of any VR game to date, and easily within my top 10 VR experiences so far. There's really one main bug with teleport and it's super easy to avoid: just don't try jumping nodes super fast in rapid succession (clickclickclick)--pause slightly between teleports and you're absolutely fine. Kinda annoying but not the catastrophe made out by the outrage-culture sky-is-falling circlejerk. Source: Encountered bug in first 30 mins, immediately realized obvious cause, restarted and played through whole game afterwards to 100% completion with zero issues. Also apparently there was a patch May 2018 and maybe this is all fixed now.","May 16, 2018 at 2:21 AM",4, 1,
