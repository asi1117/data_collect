2022-05-28 18:51:33.084746,Yogurt312,The best option you've got,"This game shines through lack of competetive other options. Fine to settle for.

It is on the whole passable and most of it's glitches, which are very apparent can be bypassed. The user interface is awkward but not arcane resulting in what I'm going to describe as usable... just.

However the conclusion I have reached is that this game was made by people with no love of firearms. Example, they have a SMG/SBR catagory, that is fine except it seems strange to lump those together and it doesn't contain any SBRs (yet, which is fine). However, the thompson sub machine gun appears in the machine gun catagory, as does an AK 47 (as opposed to the existing and somewhat barren assault rifle catagory). In fact the machine gun catagory doesn't seem to contain any actual machine guns and is more a repository for things a 7 year old would call a machine gun because they saw it in a movie once.

Shotguns fire 4 pellets and seem to have twice the expected spread. I'm sure you could have a cartridge that has these properties but the question I have in that regard is, why would you? You can make shotguns in any arbitrary size, why would you use this cartridge for target shooting?

Those are some prime examples but there are many more to find.

The game also shows a remarkable lack of polish (it has many bugs), in almost all cases it fails to capitalise on the fact that it is in fact a computer game and doesn't have to rely on real world mechanics for accuracy feedback and the one time that it does, the feedback window cannot be moved, obscures 1/3 of the field and cannot be shot through.

I would call this a solid two months work but it's been out for three years. The game overall gives the impression that it is an assembly of prepurchased assets (although I don't think it is, the art quality is too consistant) more interested in expanding content that fixing it's existing cut and paste content or capitalising on even low hanging fruit from the digital age.","Aug 2, 2020 at 9:14 AM",2, 11,"Yogurt  
First thank you for taking the time to play and review our game. A few points we would like to expand upon from your review.  The decision to make the armory categories broader was done to not make the menus seem so cluttered which is why some categories such as the SMG / SBR category are combined.  During the interface design the thinking was the player did not want to have to scroll through 20+ categories of weapons to find something they wanted.  Most of our players are split between two categories such as gun enthusiast and casual gamers.  We have actually received feedback from both groups either stating the firearms don’t operate authentic enough or the exact opposite they should be easier to use and more arcade like even though the firearm does not operate that way in real life.   Trying to strike the right balance has been a challenge but we appreciate all the feedback from our players as we can get.  I will forward your information along to our dev team.  Our next patch coming out in a about a month is updating our hand animation and haptic feedback systems in the game.  Please feel free to reach out to me directly regarding any more feedback you have to offer for our game. justin@invidiousstudios.com"

Cant get Sub menu's access, vis displays float, but can't select options on bottom
If when loading mag in tut. or firing get ahead of talk, cant exit or restart!
Have to kill app from Oculus and start again.

In Tut. menus, can't get back to menus or selection screens.

In Ranges, can't access wepons/ammo menus.

Thanks, still fun.

Like the ranges, like the guns, like the phisicks.

Speaking as A Crack shot, (3"" group at 300 yds with all but Long&Short Bows),
Like with all Games except Oblivion and Unreal, I cant approach my real life
abillities.

I Suspect this could be a good training aid!","Apr 1, 2020 at 10:58 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:51:33.146579,Breatheheartfire,"Fun for the money, could use some work","granted, this is still early access.  Me being a firearm enthusiast (gun nut) I decided I would give this a try!  Theres multiple issues that make it not really super realistic, partially just the physical mechanics of the controllers (not much can be done about that) though I would suggest there could be some tweaks to the program to make it better.  For instance I should be able to hold a rifle with my off hand and manipulate the safety with my trigger hand, however I cannot.  the recoil animation axis' is on the pistol grip and there is ""flip up"" on the rifles... this one is a bit weird and not how muzzle rise or recoil should appear.  another thing that may or may not be able to be simulated in vr is a proper looking  CCO, Holo, red dot optic with its parallax free functionality; I havent seen it emulated in a game yet, but I would think in VR you have true depth perception, and though it cant be properly seen on a 2D screen, in 3D it should be possible..  Maybe im asking too much for such a cheap game?  Keep up the good work guys, its a good attempt... I know I'd love to see an M14/M1A added and maybe some other non Stoner AR varients as to me, one AR shoots the same as another.. Maybe a Kel-Tec RDB lol","Mar 1, 2020 at 12:59 PM",3, 5,well pass on to the dev team. a new update is launching soon. stay tuned.
