2022-05-28 17:25:21.321815,Surgeus,Chilling,"Fits the niche genre I love most - existential problems concerning the creation of AI.  It was rather short, and while that was a bit disappointing, sometimes you don't need much to get the point across.

Only real bit of criticism is that being attached to a character with a body that looks nothing like my own broke the immersion for me - I'm not really the victim because of this, so I think it was a little less horrific than it could've been, and I have no info on who this person is for the most part so there isn't an emotional attachment to them either.  I know this was made in 2016 so there's probably not going to be an update, but if there were, I'd honestly probably recommend removing the viewer's body.

It's free, short, horrific, made me think, and in the end glad I gave it a go.",Apr 18 at 1:04 AM,4, 1,

Stories are supposed to have exposition, development, climax, conclusion.  This simply never leaves the exposition. You *spoiler* sit and listen to what would be a tear jerking monologue from a beautiful robot if it weren't for the fact that it's rather obvious what the conclusion is.

Was quite unnerving. 

It is just a tech demo though, a show of what can be done and a pretty good one at that. It seems UE4 handles VR very well which is a postive as it's behind many games these days and will be for some time to come. With more content my 3 would have been a 4, though as a demo it's almost worth that anyway but compared to other games etc on here it's very limited to wouldn't be right to give it higher. Worth a go but once you seen it once, the suspense goes forever making it pointless to own. Nice to show off to friends and family though I guess.","Jan 25, 2018 at 11:06 PM",3, 10,

2022-05-28 17:25:52.960194,FastLawyer,Nice demo,"I'm not sure I understand the 1 star reviews.  This is a short, VR demo cinematic experience.  You have the perspective of the hostage of the robot.  The robot is talking about your soon to be demise.  This is where you, as the audience, can either accept or reject this reality (perception is reality).  Blue pill or red pill.  I enjoyed it.  But my main problem was that for whatever reason, I wasn't situated exactly where the hostage was.  So I lost a lot of the immersion because where I was wasn't exactly where the hostage was.  I think before the movie starts, they should give you an alignment of where you're supposed to be so that you don't lose immersion.  Not the best dialogue, but for a VR demo, it's up there in quality.  Graphics could also be higher quality.","Sep 5, 2017 at 1:54 AM",3, 6,

So if this was your first experience in vr it probably would have been graded much higher.","Jan 13, 2017 at 6:42 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 17:26:15.077040,VulpinePanther,Thrilling monologue.,"I have to admit I installed this and put it off for the longest time out of fear not being able to stomache it. What I thought was a snuff application, is a rather interesting view into the philosophy of an A.I. that doesn't understand its own use of human emotion. Perhaps not the most original concept, but interesting all the same.

The gore that was present didn't warrant the worry I had. There are no jump scares, just a little blood.","Nov 16, 2016 at 8:15 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:26:15.122917,chmodseven,"Not great, but shows what's possible","For a robot philosopher, Abe rambles on too long, somewhat like those dull Architect scenes in The Matrix movies.  Before long, you just want him to shut up and get on with the cuttin'.  That said, the sense of body presence is done very well, and you can definitely feel the helplessness; as a precursor to future potential horror games along the same lines of imprisonment and body horror, it shows hints of what might be possible.","Nov 27, 2016 at 6:50 PM",3, 1,
