2022-05-28 16:53:08.578213,ThatGeezer,It's Finally Fixed,"Though its a little short, I would say it is definatly worth a play through especially if you are a fan of the Psychonaughts series. and if you have played through both  the main games it is a nice add on. Even with Dr.Loboto making me jump at 4 in the mornig. 

Thanks to the team that actually fixed it and made it playable.",Aug 29 at 3:12 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:53:08.594170,Wricken,Wait until it's fixed,"I bought this game, and I was really enjoying it at first.

But, like the others, my game always crashes in the underwater lab, which is like 10 minutes into the game (if that). There doesn't seem to be any way to get past it.

This seems like a solid game (and exactly what I would've wanted from a Psychonauts VR experience), but you should hold off on buying it until it's fixed.","Nov 14, 2020 at 3:25 AM",1, 5,"Hi there!

Unfortunately the game gets stuck loading with white screen until it eventually crashes and I’m looking at my library once again.. it happens right after the scene with the father..
I’d give 5 stars if was working","Oct 30, 2020 at 10:39 AM",1, 4,"Hi there! We apologize for the inconvenience.

2022-05-28 16:53:08.625087,David Wagner ITTR,Update ..,"Update: Devs fixed the problem. 5 stars.

I loved this game way back when on PSVR. But when playing on my Quest 2 AND Rift S, a fatal error freezes on a white screen. Each time it happens I’m almost done with the underwater psychonaut’s station where they’re holding Lilly’s father. As soon as the game puts me back in her father’s mind while he’s hanging there, the screen fades to white and freezes up. I did quite a bit of troubleshooting on my end with my setup and restarting Oculus, switching USB 3 ports, lowering the game’s resolution, then tried playing it on my Rift S, same exact thing. The game in general is great, but I need it to work for me to give 5 stars.","Jun 25, 2021 at 3:20 PM",5, 4,"Hi there! We apologize for the inconvenience.

2022-05-28 16:53:08.641045,Palieus,Loads of fun :),The graphics are done well. The characters are entertaining' some good laughts. One to have for the Library for sure.,"Jun 29, 2019 at 2:08 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:53:11.773666,Marchewiusz,Good in every possible way!,"It takes a few hours to complete this game, but this is by no means one of those cheap games that jumps on vr-hype-experience bandwagon.
This game is actually well made. Great voice acting, animations, graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack. 
If you like puzzle/adventure games you can't go wrong with this one. 

I got it on sale and it was a steal.
Totally hooked on psyhonauts right now. Waiting for Psyhonauts2!","Dec 27, 2018 at 7:57 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:53:11.789624,XtremeHardcoreGamer,"High Quality, Great VR Production.","People always complain about VR being riddled with ""indie"" games--- this is not that, it has all the spit and polish of a AAA game or Hollywood movie. The gameplay isn't the best and the puzzles are simple-- yeah, but Rhombus was still engaging with terrific writing, voice acting, animation, and art design. These devs know how to put quality products together. 

One sequence in particular was amazing with a stop motion flair to the animation.

The game was a little on the short side- but long compared to other VR fare. Expect 4-5 hours. This is obviously a labor of love. If you played Psychonauts 1 and are familiar with the characters and enjoyed them, then this is a must buy. Still worth it if unfamiliar too.","Dec 27, 2018 at 7:01 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:53:11.803586,RuneSR2,Great point and click adventure,"It's not the same as Day of the Tentacle, but the utterly insane and crazy spirit is so well preserved. If you're into Tim Shafer's humor, give this one a try - in this adventure game genre and in VR, it's the best you'll find for now. Worked perfectly using super sampling 2.0 and a GTX 1080.","Nov 12, 2018 at 4:24 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:53:14.892325,SparkyNinja1583,Awesome but wait for a sale,This was a fantastic point and click style game. If you like the Psychonauts you should grab this. I got it on sale for a couple bucks. Well worth the price I got it for. The game can be completed in about 2 hours and there's little replay value so I'll let you decide if the 15 dollar price tag is worth it. That's probably the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.,"Jun 12, 2018 at 10:13 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:53:14.907285,IzzyGrizzly,"Great mechanics, technical issues","I got an hour into this game and loved it! Great story and mechanics, as expected. The following time I rebooted it, however, I had issues with resolution. For some reason the graphics are now very blurry. The graphics options are limited as it is, but even the resolution bar is locked. 

I found no forums addressing this issue so I hope I will find answers here. I want to keep playing this game, but the resolution issue is just too much to overcome!","May 17, 2018 at 7:19 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 16:53:14.921248,syrent,It's a VR point and click adventure!,"With the right kind of writing, style, and scenario, a point and click adventure can really be a ton of fun. Tim Schafer's works are just that. If you come in aware that this is a VR adventure game experience in the vein of Grim Fandango or Day of the Tentacle, you will almost certainly enjoy this as much as I did. A shame it's short. I can only hope that Double Fine makes a full length, full priced game in this style some day. I see so much potential here for visual storytelling and puzzle solving. Just...less fish hopping next time.","Apr 22, 2018 at 8:09 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:53:14.936207,ryansv,"Point and Click ""Adventure""","The game is less than 2 hours long and has no replay value. No free movement, no motion controls, and the movement system is not at all enjoyable. 



Might be worth it for die-hard Psychonauts, but as a casual fan this just doesn't have enough content or interactivity.","Apr 23, 2018 at 4:16 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 16:53:14.952165,rh_galaxy,A real solid game on first version,"No bugs seen, great controls, excellent gfx, good story, good voice acting - much humor.

2022-05-28 16:53:18.076807,paw9k,Fun Point/Click in VR,"Great personailty to the whole experience!  Bright and colorful, fun, and halarious.  Doesn't make use of the touch controllers in displaying your hands but the way the game plays you don't need them.  You use the controllers to use psycic powers based on where your looking.  Here's hoping we see more Vr expereinces from Double Fine!","May 3, 2018 at 3:56 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:53:18.091767,nrosko,,"The art & production is first class, its short but i didn't feel short changed. you basically transport your self around the enviroment by teleporting into somebody elses mind. You manipulate the world using your special powers & solve simple puzzles. Lots of humour, ridiculous story, you can't lose at this game its more an interactive animation.","Apr 22, 2018 at 4:57 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:53:18.105730,AlexLen,Great but it has potential for much more,"The game design is beautiful, funny and creative + the gameplay enjoyable. It is short yet not too sort - would love to see more content with updates. What would give the game 5+ stars would be the ability to move with some characters around all the beautifull invironments and solving phisical puzzles as well ... it would enhance the game machanics and the depth of the gameplay. But the game is from Doublefine productions so it is brilliant as such. 
What would be even more mind bending for me would be to revive the developers game The Cave in VR. 

Thumbs up and keep up the good work.","Apr 23, 2018 at 2:04 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:53:18.120690,SpectralVenom,Visually great but lacking...,"I'll start with playtime since many base time you get from a game with its cost, it took me about 2 hours. And once that 2 hours is up there is no replay value here. I'll start out with the good, the visuals are great and it starts right from the events that took place in psychonauts 1. But beyond the visual and nostalgia from seeing the characters again thats where the good ends. The gameplay mechanics are lack luster and it's essentially a point and click game in VR. And more than half the game is leap frogging from fish to fish using this. They use this to flesh out the story which to be honest isn't really anything compelling and almost comes across as artifically increasing the time of the game. The puzzles are very basic and when you are trying to figure out what to next the characters give hints way too quickly. I really enjoyed psychonauts 1 so this was a disappointment, for the current price of $15 I would pass.","Apr 22, 2018 at 6:45 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:53:18.135650,TheRealBeta64,Fantastic! (even if it was only 2 hours),"So, I literally just finished playing Psychonauts Rhombus of Ruin, and wow. This is the best VR game I've played. I liked it so much, I played the entire game in one sitting (i.e. a little over 2 hours). Fantastic visuals, great world building, fun gameplay... I only wish environments were more varied and it was longer, but overall... BUY THIS NOW","Apr 21, 2018 at 3:24 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:53:21.213418,BoginDA,Very enjoyable puzzle game,"This game was very comfortable, had and AWESOME art style, and fun rewarding puzzles.  I was a little sad it was only about 2 hours for me, but I enjoyed the story and the humor, so I give it 5 stars.","Apr 24, 2018 at 9:50 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:53:21.228378,ntkoopman,,"Fun game that fits nicely with the first Psychonauts game. If you haven't played the original game this one will probably not make any sense to you. The art and production is really good, but it's very short (like an hour).","Apr 21, 2018 at 3:32 AM",4, 9,

My Thoughts:
As a massive fan of the original pancake version, I had a feeling this was going to be something special, and it is.

The cool and wacky universe really comes alive in VR and adds an additional cool element to the lore.

The graphics, characters and environments are unique and full of charm and wonder and the puzzles are refreshing and the narrative as funny as always.
