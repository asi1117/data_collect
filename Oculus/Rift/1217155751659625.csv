2022-05-28 16:46:37.620883,Bluray Charles,Great first experience for VR beginners,"If you have a parent, grandparent, or non-gamer that wants to give VR a shot, this is a great way for them to see what its about. There's no movement, no potential for motion sickness, no jumpscares, and it moves at their pace with no stress. It's also just a fun and charming experience.

But then, I all of a sudden find myself standing in an RV.  ""We are not in Kansas anymore."" I said to myself after that I think I was reduced to giggles and the occasional ""woah"". 

THEN a robot shows up and wants to play with me. I'm talking to him asking his name, trying to pet him. He's a he I guess I decided. I went into like insta-toddler mode. What a unique experience that I will always remember. I only wish I could relive the magic again for the first time.

A Vr headset means to be a display that's all. I have an Htc vive and we have to use revive to play that demo which I loved , but for now I wanted to show that to my daughter , guess what oculus did , an update which will stop you from using it from revive , such frustration. You have to pay an oculus or <3<3<3<3 you ! Nice move ! Compared to steam vr which is and still be an OPEN  platform  , something that you don't have a clue about , is how things needs to be. Oculus, I wanted to buy an oculus rift but as I can see , you guys are a bunch of selfish and money grabbing folks , but gosh , people actually don't buy your stuff because of that. But hell , Facebook bought your company so what you do now you'd still remain with no issues I'm a right ? Let's see that in some couple of years.","Jul 23, 2018 at 7:11 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 16:47:06.159553,onceinAwhile,Could not make a better starter app,"To be honest, I was totally blown away when I did wear my headset and this launched. I had the oculus in its infancy, and used to play some of the early games; but then I got into this very detailed room, with atomsphere and interactable items all over, and just got a feel that maybe we got VR right this time.

The various activities are mundane and really simplistic, but that WOW effect you get once you are in that van, interacting with the friendly robot, with somehting that is more than just point or grab something, is insanely addictive and really well done.

You can see value in VR when you play products like this: great graphic that is not ""cartoonish"", and at the same time, you can get good details (I think robo recall is the only other product with the same look and feel). You can have simulations of many jobs in this way; or wacky fun stuff that still seems realistic; and this product show that it is possible, when you design a product from the ground up, to be VR based, and not a generic product with VR functionalities slapped on, for the sake of saying ""it is a VR game"".

You will see if you can pick up the robot's hands before you turn him on (you can't).  You will try to put the cartridge in the machine when there is already one in there, and realize you keep forgetting to take the old one out before you try to put the new one in.  You will try pressing random buttons around you. You will realize that you can print out more objects if you keep pressing the button next to the printer.
