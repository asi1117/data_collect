2022-05-28 17:38:07.812246,julian.hettich.92,Considering that it's free,"Interesting Visuals create a memorable (short) experience. 
The only thing missing is a real end.",Sep 11 at 7:13 AM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:38:07.827206,BiovizierMantrid,Decent But Short...,"...other than that, what the cheezwiz is Alice Cooper doing in there?","Jun 12, 2020 at 3:13 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 17:38:07.841168,Pokento,,"I liked the world but you dont have to much things to interact with, neither the lanscape, it would be better some music and a travel by Dali world.
The images are not soft so in every move u can see an unstable view.","Jan 30, 2020 at 11:25 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:38:07.856128,mark garroutte,One of my faves,"This is so surreal and so Dali,I really love the immense landscape,could just sit and relax while taking it all in.","Oct 28, 2019 at 6:16 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:38:07.870091,Dietsoup,I'm a big Dali fan so I loved this!,I hope you add onto this! Ill be keeping my eye out for more content! It was short but it made me want to see more!,"Apr 10, 2019 at 8:01 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:38:11.005704,theemarkhumenik,Cool. For 5 minutes.,I was fortunate to experience this at the Dali Museum in Saint Petersburg Florida. I was with my brother and his wife and they were able to experience a little bit of VR. Cool.  They loved it.I downloaded the app hoping for more. There wasn't. That said it was a cool 5 minutes.,"Nov 4, 2018 at 10:16 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 17:38:11.020664,Jesus_Silence,Great visualization of Dalí's paintings,Nice detour into a slower parallel universe. Loved it.,"Oct 4, 2018 at 11:42 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:38:11.035624,Obskura,Not a lot here ...,"There just isn't much to see here, it's as if an art history student in college made this as their final. It doesn't fully explore the artist's life or seek anything more from his work than just a few simple set pieces.","Jul 26, 2018 at 8:26 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 17:38:11.050584,jeff.xu.7,Amazing Giant Spider Elephant!!!!,It's free! It's worth playing just to see the amazing giant elephant spider things! So trippy!,"Jul 10, 2018 at 2:44 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:38:11.064547,nightcat.mau,Very Cool!,"I’m not sure why people didn’t like this. The distant voice over is a nice touch, and I liked the dayglo, um, whomever he was. There were long-legged elephants that will walk right over you like something from Star Wars and some odd characters. A little bit spooky in some parts and blasting up the towers is fun. Not sure if I really got a deeper appreciation of Dali’s work, but it was still enjoyable.","Mar 19, 2018 at 6:19 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:38:14.178220,WG1,,"Environment is awesome, teleport to several viewpoints marked by white globes.
Would be cool to have some freedom to move, but this app is very optimized , small download for the content.
Limiting to teleport and just look around at each spot eliminates the need for collision models and keeps the focus on viewing the artwork. Thank you !","Mar 21, 2018 at 6:43 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 17:38:14.193179,GusmanB,Wasted opportunity,"Daly has some of the bizarrest worlds in his paintings, restricting this to the most bland creations of Dali and just some fixed view points is a waste,  maybe in the future if the devs add full locomotion and expand this to more of the Dali's work may be worth to experience, but for now, no way, there are a lot better free experiences than this.","Mar 16, 2018 at 5:18 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 17:38:14.208139,TimDillon,Amazing Experiential piece,Check it out,"Aug 26, 2018 at 1:29 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:38:14.222101,metafish69,Great for a first time VR experience!,"This is one of the better free tech demos that I've come across. It's beautiful, not to intense, easy to navigate, and also very easy to restart from the beginning if you wish to switch viewers. The image clarity is very good with little to no blur. Dali is so surreal and interesting that his vision translates great to a VR space.

The only thing that pulls this down to a four-star review for me is the limiting of movement. If there were to be implemented some simple locomotives to move around the world a bit more freely utilizing the touch with this it twould make the experience one of the best tech demos.

Still a four-star and, in my opinion, a must have!","Feb 25, 2018 at 3:55 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:38:17.356718,notsniw1,Just one criticism,"It was too short, but can't really complain cause it's free. This was definitely different than any of the other VR experiences. I can see this becoming a popular way for all types of artists to showcase their work. That includes musicians in possibly a laser light show format etc.","Mar 15, 2018 at 6:28 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:38:17.370680,lowtechdroid,,"Not much to see, the rendering isn't very competently done, and you constantly have to turn ~180° to progress to other points.","Apr 16, 2018 at 12:40 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:38:17.386638,FastLawyer,Do you have be tripping on mushrooms,"To enjoy this VR experience?  Because I have no idea what that was.  There's some weird audio going on in the background.  You teleport by looking at these white balls.  Then at some point, you see a lobster trying to answer a phone that keeps ringing.  You then teleport high above these towers.  Then finally, you get to these elephants that look like they are walking on stilts or maybe they have gigantic cricket legs.  WTF?","Feb 16, 2018 at 10:20 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 17:38:17.401597,pshift,Cool start,"If you aren't culturally ignorant like the negative reviewer below, then you will likely be familiar with Dali and his work, and won't find this a ""confusing"" experience.

It's a creative concept, but I'm hoping this is very early access because there isn't much to it at this point.  Nevertheless, if the idea of stepping into a Dali painting appeals to you, this is worth checking out while it's free.  

To the devs: you need to add controller support so people can point and click on the balls instead of having to stare at them.","Feb 18, 2018 at 2:03 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 17:38:17.416557,Elpoc,Not bad,"Beautiful and strange environment, much as you would expect. Also the usual basic flaw of having moving creatures (elephants) with rubbish, inorganic animation.","Apr 4, 2018 at 1:43 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:38:20.525243,Vic0348,Couldn't move past the second waypoint,Looks promising. Unfortunately I couldn't get past the second waypoint; looking at the next white ball didn't 'activate it'. Also the audio sounded badly muffled; the conversation between father and son (?) wasn't comprehensible.,"Feb 24, 2018 at 6:44 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 17:38:20.540203,FriendCalledFive,Great free Dali experience,"I like the fidelity in this, it looks a lot better than a free app should. It has some lovely Dali imagary, the main moving animals are really good.

Only downsides are that the audio of Dali talking in the background is very quiet and you can hardly understand any of it, and the teleportation nodes are a bit big and obtrusive.","Feb 23, 2018 at 12:30 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 17:38:20.554165,thoiter,Pretty cool,Small but perfectly formed Dali-esque experience.  Weird and wonderful graphics.,"Feb 15, 2018 at 4:20 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 17:38:20.568128,DreamerO,3/5 as it is now,"I loved the visualization...but it was certainly too short, and it could become so much better. If updates ever come out for this to include more of his works I will increase my star rating and update my review -- For now it gets a solid 3, and is worth a free install.","Mar 18, 2018 at 4:25 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:38:20.583088,Bob-Rolha,Very little content,"I thought I would like it, but it has very little content and the way to explore the environment is not the best. I think an automatic low-speed air ride would be better. But it's worth it to use at least once. It's free.","Feb 21, 2018 at 7:57 PM",2, 0,
