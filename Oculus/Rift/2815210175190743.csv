2022-05-28 19:25:08.963989,PhilthyRiffs,Lovely VR Art - Must Have!,"I recently stumbled across The Omnigallery during my quest to explore VR art. I've not only found what I was searching for - but found such an astonishing VR experience that I now consider a must have for VR enthusiasts! 

This experience is amongst one of the coolest I've had the pleasure of diving into with my PCVR setup. I love how immersed one can get when simply viewing the masterful artwork of others. 

Thank you so much for creating this - hats off you to! I'll be showing my support and also picking up The Surreal Imaginarium - can't wait!",Feb 20 at 3:06 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:25:08.978949,Master_Eiji,Far Out..,"Seems with this app, you have to think in fourth (or even fifth) dimensional terms... since it seem the ""usual"" rules (up, down, left, right, here, there..etc) dont seem to apply in the normal sense... (like getting into the classics area..)
Since you can move into some of the pieces.. I mean..talk about ""getting into art""...
can hardly wait for the next exhibit...",Nov 27 at 12:56 AM,5, 1,"Wait is over, the next universe, The Vault, is out!"
2022-05-28 19:25:08.992912,leoI3ug,One of the best experiences with VR art!,I cant wait to see the next exhibits. It was all so unique! The rooms with immersive VR art installations. WOW. When I looked at the watch 4h has passed. Congratulations!,Jan 22 at 3:44 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:25:09.008869,nightcat.mau,Truly Amazing Experience!,"I got lost for over an hour amongst the artwork and statuary. Bravo! Honestly, is there anything better than artwork, architecture and classical music paired together? You can even watch the clouds drift by. I've seen several VR art galleries and this experience is by far the best.","Jan 21, 2020 at 3:41 AM",5, 5,Thanks so much! Cant wait to finish the next exhibition :D
2022-05-28 19:25:09.022832,FastLawyer,Really nice app,You get to see masterpiece paintings in VR. Plus it's free. What else do you want for free?,"Dec 31, 2019 at 1:27 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:25:12.123539,makispatrinos,,"Excellent software with many well known art pieces. For all us art lovers, it''s one of the reasons we bought a vr set! And the fact that it is free is a reason for everyone to check it!","Mar 16, 2020 at 2:31 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:25:12.138499,LeeoSeven,REALLY NICE !,"I really enjoyed this, very relaxing & a great way to spend an hour learning about famous paintings & sculptures whilst listening to the relaxing classical music. I knew some of the paintings & found it very interesting learning about the ones I hadn’t seen before. I can’t believe it’s free! It’s an extremely solid experience. Top marks from me.","Sep 29, 2019 at 2:21 AM",5, 6,Thank you so much for the feedback! it means a lot to me :D
2022-05-28 19:25:12.153459,UrsulaMajor,Incredible app. Want more!!,Spending lots of time in it. Ready to pay for it. Please add more content.,"Nov 2, 2019 at 7:19 AM",5, 0,"Glad to hear you enjoy it, and dont worry, this will always be free, including the coming exhibits. If you want to support me you can buy The Surreal Imaginarium, my first virtual gallery with my own paintings and crazy effects. You wont regret it."
2022-05-28 19:25:12.169416,Queherain,Quite good !,"An art gallery with a good choice of famous painting works. The text explanations are a bit fuzzy, but can be read aloud. The only thing I would improve is the presentation after centuries or style.","Sep 21, 2019 at 12:50 PM",5, 3,"Thanks for the feedback! Ill see if I can do something to make the text sharper, but I think its because of the Rift's pixel density. Im working on a port for the Quest which is higher resolution and it reads great. And yeah, I get the last comment a lot, but one thing I wanted to avoid was exactly that, having all the art in its different groups or categories. I wanted to mixed it up a bit. Maybe in the future when I have more pieces Ill do more ""focused"" exhibits. 
Look out for future exhibits, they are definitely coming. This is the first of at least 10 exhibits I have planned."

2022-05-28 19:25:15.294059,bneiderman,Cool but buggy,The information for each picture is at some strange angle and you can't adjust it or read it that well. Otherwise pretty cool.,"Sep 21, 2019 at 3:58 AM",3, 1,"Yeah, I tried to do it the best I could. Reading its always awkward in VR unless its huge. And you can adjust the text. On the sides, at the bottom, there's 2 arrows, one to move it to the left, and another one to the right. Ill try to make the text sharper but I think its limited by the Rift pixel density. Im working on a port for the Quest (higher pixel density) and it instantly looks a lot better. 
Thanks for the feedback!!"
