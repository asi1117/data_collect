2022-05-28 17:10:26.691631,WhitesideVFX,"Good idea, mediocre execution","Like the other experience in this series, I like the idea of it. It's just that the setting is mostly un-inspired.
The graphics in this one are more interesting and better scaled than the one about the carribean troops, but without a central character to connect to, it was more about looking at the environments while the narrator talks. 
This would work better if the environments were more dynamic. 
But then again, it's free. So it's still worth experiencing. Just a shame they couldn't have taken it from interesting concept to great execution.","Dec 4, 2019 at 1:05 PM",3, 0,
