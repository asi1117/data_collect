2022-05-28 20:48:28.617697,Gonzaxpain,Great VR version of a classic,"I've never been a big fan of point and click games but at the same time I've always loved puzzles and stories. I tried Myst many many years ago and got tired of all the clicking so when a VR version was announced I thought this was the right time to get immersed into it.
The VR implementation is fantastic, you can move very fast, both when walking and running (thanks for that), controls are great, it looks gorgeous on PC and puzzles are varied and good; the same goes for all the different places you visit. Some are quite hard (others seem hard but are actually quite easy once you realise what you need to do) but overall with some help here and there you can finish the whole game without issues and it's totally worth it. The world they've created is beautiful and very immersive and it just gets better in VR which is IMO the perfect media for this type of game.
You can take pictures with the in-game camera which is a very helpful tool you can use in order to remember codes and other clues. It is pretty much everything you need for that. 
If you're a fan of puzzle games and like a challenge, Myst VR is probably the best option there is and as I said  before, the VR implementation is very good, not an afterthought like in some other games. I absolutely loved my time in the world of Myst, if the sequels get the VR treatment someday I will definitely buy them on launch day, it's that good.

I played the game on Quest 2 via Link (which worked very well) and also at times on my Index, which also worked great. I tried the Quest 2 version as well since the game is crossbuy on Oculus and while it was really good for the device it couldn't hold a candle to the beauty you get on PC. Still a very good and recommended option if you don't have a VR-capable PC.",Mar 10 at 12:09 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:48:28.631660,Don0lper,Unbeliveable,"Me and my 2 kids love this game. I have played the Myst in 1997 and now again in 2022. What a welcome back to Myst in a whole new experience. My daughter on 11 love to solve puzzles and my son just got hooked at once. This game is one of a kind and in VR its just getting even better even though I did not think it was possible. From a scale from 1-10 where 10 is best Myst get 12. If you like a good story, lost of puzzle and a great grafic play this through your computer via link caple otherwise its getting a bit downgraded. Hope you will enjoy like me and my kids. Best regards.",Feb 15 at 10:03 PM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:48:28.647618,zita,Bug fest!,"Increddibly buggy experience for me at least! I love the series and wanted to replay it in VR, but this is virtually impossible to play with graphical glitches and bugs that makes me go nuts. For instance the main menu cannot be accessed most of the time, so forget saving your progress and look at hint-photos you take.",Jan 26 at 8:42 PM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:48:28.672551,watsonz1211,Cyan brings back the Classic,"I have been a long time fan of Myst, as I'm sure most people are who are interested in Myst at this point. I have played pretty much every iteration that's come out over the years, from realMyst, to Myst on Mobile. I was very excited to hear Myst was coming to VR, especially after how well Obduction was, albiet the VR-portion wasn't the best, it wasn't terrible either.

I'm glad to say they definitely learned their lesson. I only encountered one or two game-breaking glitches in the few hours I played, and thankfully they didn't take too long to fix. I did however run into a bizarre glitch in the Stoneship Age where I couldn't get the generator to work, no matter how long I spun the wheel in either direction. Fixed it by playing Desktop and doing the same thing again several times. I reached out to Cyan support, and they responded the same day, which definitely impressed me.

If they can iron out some of the issues with textures with text not fully loading until you're close, causing it to be blurry at what I consider to be a normal reading distance; I would say its a phenominal remaster. I wasn't very taken in by the new 3D cinematics, thankfully they left in the old quicktime videos, which I absolutely love.",Dec 22 at 12:45 AM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:48:28.687511,Ashok,Great VR game with a few minor quirks!,"Myst has always had a special place in my heart from its very roots with the CD-ROM back in 1993!  It's a perfect world for VR and Cyan... mostly delivers.  The game runs beautifully on my PC and the new textures look fantastic.  Interactivity is also well executed and the locomotion options are great.

My only major complaint is Roomscale movement seems to have problems.  I'm playing Myst VR in a large play area and while the game works great with analog movement, it seems to have some issues with Roomscale movement. The game will randomly ""blackout"" when I am walking around in real life and I have to move back a few steps for the video to come back. It's like the game thinks my avatar is clipping thru a wall but I'm not even close to any walls or objects.  I hope Cyan will look into this issue further and release a fix.",Aug 27 at 9:47 PM,4, 35,"Hi there, thanks so much for the kind words! With regards to roomscale movement, do let us know where you are experiencing the blackout issue. We do blackout the screen when you approach a boundary (on purpose) so that folks can't peek/peer into areas that could be spoilers. We would like to improve this experience though if you have any feedback -- please let us know at support@cyan.com."
2022-05-28 20:48:31.785225,ShocksVR,"Looks great, Crossbuy/Flatscreen support","I originally purchased the Quest2 version of Myst. 

As a Crossbuy title I was able to get access to the Rift/Desktop copy for FREE (thank you!).  My Quest2 is currently not available for service, so I was pleasantly surprised to see Cyan included FLATSCREEN support - this means we get 3 copies of  Myst - Quest, Rift(PCVR), and Desktop (PC) [right click on the title and select desktop mode].  Thus, I'm playing the flastscreen version until my Quest2 is good to go again.

Thoughts
- Myst looks great and is a considerable visual upgrade over the Quest version.  
 The world environmets feature a lot of detail, and it truly looks like a modern 2021 title. Plus there's Ray Tracing support for those of us sporting the latest RTX gpus.

Thanks Cyan for the great remaster and including access to all 3 versions of the game.",Aug 27 at 2:54 AM,5, 26,Thank you so much for the kind words!
2022-05-28 20:48:31.801183,jutorres91,Absolutely Incredible,"I remember playing through the Myst series with my parents for the first time about 15 years ago. I played through all the titles on my Dad's very old computer and the whole while I was thinking it was the most amazing experience ever. Cut to today, I'm browsing through the Oculus store when suddenly, the MYST advert appears in front of me, my jaw drops to the floor. 

 I downloaded it immediately and I got choked up when I heard that music again for the first time. The familiar tune of the Cyan logo brought me right back to my childhood home from 15 years ago. I'm not exaggerating when I say tears welled in my eyes as I took my first steps, I had to actually lift my headset up and wipe my eyes a bit. 

The game is obviously not perfect, but no game ever is. For me, the visual beauty and emotional significance far outweighs any bugs. And honestly I’m about halfway through and have yet to experience any major bugs. 

I recommend Myst VR for anyone feeling nostalgic about the series. I also recommend it for anyone that’s new to the Myst community because once you put that headset on you won’t be able to take it off. I can’t wait to see what Cyan does for the next VR remake.",Aug 31 at 7:48 AM,5, 8,Thank you so much for the kind words!
2022-05-28 20:48:31.815146,thomasg86,A VR Masterpiece,"A must have if you are a VR fan and have any interest in the puzzle genre. Cyan did an amazing job re-imagining their 1993 classic and making it absolutely shine in VR.

Either version, 2D or VR, is stunning. This is about as good as games look at the moment. There are a couple of concessions I noticed they probably had to make to get the VR side to perform, but unless you are looking for them you probably won't even notice. It's one of the best looking PCVR games out there. The game is well optimized and provides DLSS support. Ran smooth as butter for me on my 3070.

Also, the quality of life improvements for VR (and just updating the game in general) are really well thought out. Cyan has definitely improved their VR chops from Obduction. There are a few minor bugs here and there that I am sure will get patched out soon. Nothing even remotely gamebreaking.

This title is full CROSS BUY which is great, so if you have a standalone Quest you can play on the go. All in all, a hearty recommendation from me!",Aug 31 at 12:27 PM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:48:31.830105,LANFEUST,Very good VR conversion of a masterpiece,"I have played it a bit on Quest 2 then installed it on PC.
This game need graphic power to shine and the PC version is far better than Quest. My GPU is a 1080Ti OC so there is no problem to run this game on Epique settings (50% of load).
Please, could you go further with the supersampling setting, cause it is actually limited to 100%. Thanks.
Great to see the original cinematics with the last patch 👍",Sep 6 at 5:57 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:48:31.845066,PencilWhipped,"For The Love Of Pete, Just Get It.","If you’ve played Myst before? You’ll feel like you’ve hit a new milestone in your life.

Gone is the clickable 2D slideshow of the 90’s, and the flat-screen 3D remakes of the 00’s. 

Thanks to VR, your brain will now remember Myst as a place you’ve ACTUALLY been to.

If this is your first time? I hope you like exploring, solving puzzles, and cracking mysteries…

…’Cause this one’s a real doozie!

There’s a reason this game started a whole GENRE of gaming… called ‘Myst Clones’.",Sep 13 at 9:52 AM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:48:34.923831,Retribution,A real VR treat.,"I really love this VR game. I havent played this since the late 90s and bringing it to VR is a nostalgic dream.  An immersive puzzle solver that really makes you think. I really hope there are plans to release Riven and all the other Myst 3 , 4...etc in VR format. 

Is there a chance you could add the Age of Rime in a future patch",Sep 5 at 7:55 PM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:48:34.938791,SICMaggot22,Almost Perfect!,"I'd give it a solid 9 out of 10. Everything is perfect except for the new 3D Character models for Atrus and his sons. I'm not yet sold on this decision although I understand why they did it; in preperation for future Myst remasters. Everything else though, the graphics, atmosphere, music, tone, perfect. I can't help but feel like they could have found a happy medium somewhere in there between 3D characters and live actors. The camera function is perfect for VR users who can't otherwise keep notes. I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that it doesn't take them very long to produce a remaster of Riven on this level. I may never leave VR if that happens!",Aug 30 at 2:26 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:48:34.953751,MajorAlpha,Bug….?,I play it with quest 2 with PCVR. The menu function doesn’t work. It only shows the black screen. Please fix it… I cannot save and load this game….,Oct 27 at 12:18 PM,3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:34.969708,DZWX,So fun,"My dad brought the original Myst home one day when I was a kid. It was a CD -ROM game but our computer wasn't powerful enough to run it. I have always wanted to play this, and Myst VR was worth the wait. The puzzles are unapologetically difficult (if you're not used to it), the environments are fantastic and romantic and the story is clever enough to give the whole experience some depth, yet void of cutscenes and unskippable interruptions. There really aren't any  enemies, its truly a puzzle game.",Sep 16 at 10:26 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:34.985665,saedus101x,Fantastic experience,"Thank you ofor the crossbuy, as i originaly bought this on quest 2 and it was really good. But the pcvr gfx are so much more detailed.",Aug 28 at 5:25 AM,5, 8,Thank you for the kind words!
2022-05-28 20:48:38.081386,kane100574,It is fantastic!,Beyond the bugs in all games at the start these days. It is amazing! Why does the quest stand alone version NOT have a camera?,Sep 2 at 2:00 AM,5, 3,"Thank you for the kind words! We're still working on getting a new Quest patch out, the photo album stuff for Quest has been a bit more complicated than it seems behind the scenes unfortunately."
2022-05-28 20:48:38.097343,MusicallyInspired,Best version of Myst yet,"Overjoyed with the Crossbuy offer! I owned this on the Quest 1 since December but the PC version is just so much more beautiful! What an experience! I'm just sad that the day/night cycles from realMyst (and to a lesser extent, realMyst Masterpiece Edition) are no longer present. But the art direction is so good. The giant sunset block by clouds look in Stoneship is breathtaking. Though, I do miss the rain at night. Still, what an incredible experience! 3 versions of the game in one! Thank you again, Cyan!

Also missing the Rime bonus age. But I gather that that's still on the way. I wonder if since the Starry Expanse fan remake of Riven became melded with Cyan if they're working on a preview for it in the Rime age! :D",Aug 28 at 8:13 AM,5, 6,Thank you so much for the kind words! We do hope to include an update for Rime in the future.
