I have beaten it multiple times, and each victory was extremely satisfying. I really like the fast paced doge and parry system, and the wepons and world have polish. The only thing that I am sad about with this game is the fact that there is only one campaign to go on. I would love to see more levels, different zones, and more story, but the game is still great. I would like to see more like it in the future",Jul 26 at 7:24 AM,5, 14,

Just make sure you have plenty of space as I have damaged some things swinging swords to hard. Good difficulty, very challenging.

2022-05-28 20:12:17.875504,Vantablack_,Hard to play without 360° tracking!,"It is really fun, this game brings you right into the action. The graphics are pretty fine, I love the character and map design even tho it could variy more, I hope they add more in the future. But the best part about this game are the fighting mechanics. You need to swing block and dodge at the right timing so you realy feel like you are in the fight and not just pressing buttons. This game has big pontial and should be a must buy, but I would only recommend it to people who have 360° tracking. Because I have the Oculus Rift with just 2 sensors and I keep on loosing because enemies attack you from each side very fast and I keep on loosing track to my sensors. I am buying a third one just for this game. I hope it helps.","Feb 4, 2021 at 5:14 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:12:17.890464,jac,"Fantastic game, needs more content","This is the best melee combat game I've played in VR. This includes the great Asgard's wrath and walking dead saints and sinners. I've heard it called the VR dark souls, and it has earned that title, at least with respect to gameplay.

Co-op would be great in this game.

The main complaint is the lack of content. The game has only 10 different enemies (including the boss), half of which are stronger versions of other enemies with a few new attacks. The game has you replaying the same areas many times with shuffled enemies and orders as you try to make it farther into the game.

But the games fantastic combat, smart use of upgrades and great gameplay loop keeps the game from feeling stale for the several hours it takes to beat the game. Beating the game only takes about 20-30 minutes IF you're good enough to make it that far. But it will take you several hours to get that good.

But this is no triple A game. There just isn't a lot here after you beat it and I wish there was a world I could explore with friends using this combat. This does not have the rich world building or variety of a game like dark souls. But this is how VR melee combat should work and I hope someone builds that kind of experience.

I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for really engaging VR swordplay.","Oct 28, 2020 at 12:17 PM",5, 21,

It's one of those ""one more run"" games where you keep unlocking more upgrades and keep getting further in to the game.

2022-05-28 20:12:21.060104,Iván R. P.,recommendable,"After writing a review showing a bit my disappointment at the lack of updates, the developer answered in a matter of a couple of hours to tell me that they are working on it.  Also, I have been informed by the Twitter / discord group and it is true. They are also going to release a version for Quest, which according to the developer will be Crossbuy, which just made happy my day 😁. 
  I rectify my previous review and was waiting for the news and the new launch in Quest.

 Say about the game that it is very entertaining, a rogue-game, in each game makes you try to go further and further. It is difficult, but fun and requires skill. Very advisable; If they manage to keep the game in Quest similar to Rift, it will be a must have for Quest 100%","Sep 24, 2020 at 11:15 PM",5, 10,"Champion, hang tight! The 1.0 version of the game is launching this fall. In addition, there is cross-buy with the Quest version, which is coming out next week on September 29.

2022-05-28 20:12:21.090025,Jinxluck,polished early access,"overall content/price:
content wise, even in an early access state, it has just as much (if not more) content as most other titles in the same price class, so for an early access it is a good price, if not a bit on the cheap size.

performance:
performance wise, it feels really polished, and the controls doesnt feel clunky at all, though it will take some fights before your totally used to the controles, but they are introduce in steps, so it's not that bad. The graphics are not top notch, but it's still really good, compared to most vr titles.

lore:
lore wise, there is some lore to the game, but it doesn't feel like it is the primary focus (in the early access state), but more of fun way to introduce the enviroment, and give a little feeling of purpose, to why your slaughteringyour way through wraiths.

ingame content:
in regards to abilities and weapons, there's a decent amount of choice, so you want get bored with just the starting weapons, and it seems like you unlock the weapons as you progress through the game. mob wise, it seems as there's a okay amount of variaty.

difficulty:
there's a good amount of different difficulties, although unless you start on the noob/chill difficulty, you will probably die a lot, but that's one of the games intentions, but at the same time, it doesn't feel unfair in it's difficulty (at least it hasn't yet for me.

fitness:
it is kinda fast paced and stressing (not in a bad way, just makes it more realistic), when in combat, so you are gonna work up a sweat.
just as a referance, i start to sweat faster in this, than when playing normal beatsaber (not counting the beatsaber lvl's where you have to get an epaleptic seizure to keep up)","Sep 16, 2020 at 11:01 PM",5, 4,

Only issue I had was movement outside of dashing; which has more to do with my personal preferences than a game issue. Almost wish there was some sort of auto center as I don't want to turn my body too much due to a smallish play area.

2022-05-28 20:12:24.256691,FlacoCholo,Amazing Game,"This is a really enjoyable game. It's comfortable in VR, it's engaging, and it's a blast to play.  There are ~21 levels/stages that you play through, and the next level is more difficult than the previous. You fight 'until you fall' which is where the game gets it's name, and if you fall, you start over at the beginning.  

You can upgrade your weapons with ingame 'ether' which is gained during each level, which grants your weapons special abilities, and more power.  Upgrading weapons is undoubtably my favorite part of this game.  There are 12 different weapons, and using the ether you gain, you can upgrade them. Each weapon has a max level of 10 (starting at 1) and each level allows the weapon to become more powerful.  This makes replayability amazing.  Each time you begin the journey, it's different because your weapons have something new to offer.

All in all, I would buy this game again in a heartbeat, and huge thanks to the devs for imagining and creating a wonderful immersive experience. As of now it's still early access, but I can't wait to see what else they will add to this game.

Recommendations: 
I would really like to have even more weapons (12 is a lot, I know, but I consider this to be the main point of replayability in this game so I'm a little biased) Maybe something like a weapon store, where you can unlock new weapons? Also, I think a some longer range weapons would be amazing! Bow and Arrow (or a cross-bow to make it one-handed), Ball and Chain, maybe a particle grenade type thing that you can throw. I'd be interested to see how a shield might be used too.  Or if you could hold a third weapon and switch to it if that weapon suits your current enemies more. Another review mentioned that having a random special enemy that gives a reward would be cool, which I agree with. Also, I hope that support for Oculus Quest comes quickly. I know people are waiting for that before they buy this game.","Jun 8, 2020 at 2:29 AM",5, 21,
2022-05-28 20:12:27.334033,Glitch Fandango,I love this game !,"This game is absolutely fantastic, possibly one of the best pick up and play/quick session games that I’ve come across. It’s an arcade style slasher, not a physics driven Sim, so if you’re looking for that this might not necessarily be for you.

I actually bought this a few weeks ago while looking for a “proper” sword fighting game. I was comparing this to Blade and Sorcery and Hellsplit, and I ended up refunding it because it wasn’t what I was looking for. Fast forward to the free weekend and I decided to give it another go, and with completely different expectations just fell in love with it!￼

The gameplay is fast paced, intuitive and extremely addictive. More importantly, it’s just fun! It’s a real “just one more run“ type of affair that will just eat time without you realising it (And it’s a halfway decent workout when you really get into it). When this comes to quest it will be an absolutely must have!

Well done everyone involved, you’ve delivered something to be really proud of here.","Jun 18, 2020 at 12:00 AM",4, 10,

2022-05-28 20:12:27.364951,HiredGunSG,Superb visuals and game play!,"Beautiful visuals! It's refreshing to see a developer go the way of introducing some nice color variation into their game.

The game play is fantastic! The combat is fluid with no stutter feelings. 

A good variety of different weapons which you unlock through progression which is great! Nothing should be handed to the player, they need to work for it and this game will make you work for it.

It would be neat to see something like being able to gather some type of resources that might drop off of certain enemies and forge new gauntlets that could also be augmented with some different things. If you wanted a new set of augments for your gauntlets then you could do away with the augments you have but they would be destroyed. Meaning, you need to really think about the augments you are going to use in your gauntlets before you actually implement them.

Another thing the devs could do is implement random battles with special higher tier enemies. Only when certain events are met. Add to them drops not found on norm enemies. Procedurally generated also.

I see this game going somewhere deep in customization with different builds with weapons and augments if the devs would let that happen. This would open up some more play style which would really add to this already great game.

I recently purchased this game on Steam but, I did buy this now on the Oculus store because I believe in supporting the devs of great games such as this with buying their games multiple times on different platforms.

Now, my only gripe about this game is the transistion to a new part of the area and sets of enemies. The screen will go blank and the new area and enemies will load in. Meaning, the transition from area to area and enemies is not seamless. Hopefully, this gets fixed in an update.

All in all, this game is really something to behold. Seeing how the devs keep going with progress on this game is really fantastic. This game is a beautiful addition to anyone's VR library.","May 12, 2020 at 11:44 PM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:12:27.380909,Saliken,Excellent and Addictive Melee Combat,"I've been waiting for a really good sword-fighting game to come along, and this is it. 

Until You Fall combines realistic feeling weapons with arcade-like gameplay for a best-of-both-worlds experience. 

You choose two weapons, one for each hand, and charge into battle to see how far you can get against the growing difficulty. Once you fail you're given the change to unlock new weapons and upgrade the ones you already own to become more powerful for the next run. That loop of running/upgrading is very well done and keeps me coming back to this game.

The only low-point for me is the lack of variety in the enemies and locations. It all starts to feel very ""samey"" after awhile. This does not at all detract from the core experience, but I feel that if Schell Games added a few more enemy types and changed up the environments a bit more it would help the game feel fresh for longer. I sincerely hope they continue to add more to the game, even in paid DLCs, as I greatly enjoy the core experience and would love to come back to new weapons/enemies/locations in years to come.

Great job Schell Games, with this and I Expect You To Die you are officially my favorite VR developer.","May 29, 2020 at 2:47 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 20:12:30.546532,coronbale,How melee combat is done in VR,"So I wanted to wait until I came across a game that really sparked it for me.  Sure Saints and Sinners and Alyx are 5 star worthy, but neither of these games do melee combat perfect.  Until You Fall is about as close to perfection as you can get without getting actual sword/mace/dagger props in your hands.  Here is what you can look forward to.
1. Weapons have weight!  Yea, I said it.  Swing a dagger and it feels fast, but swing  broad sword or mace, and you get this weight lag that after a few minutes feels like your wielding a physical weapon.  I found myself giving practice swings back and forth before engaging an enemy, just to get the feel right.
2. Jitter - You ever watch a Skyrim style VR game, and it looks like the giant weapon they are holding is vibrating?  Its because the response is TOO accurate.  This game (and to their respects Alyx and S&S) have a smoothing code going, so your sword doesnt feel like its made out of tissue paper.  It gives it a much smoother feel.
3. Blocking done right - The skill of this game is understanding your opponent, knowing your positioning, and timing block and attack effectively.  More than once I found myself leading enemies before the block pops, just because I know their movements well enough to anticipate it.  This comes in handy in nightmare mode, when you dont have time to wait for the block symbol half the time.
4. Awesome Arsenal - Each weapon has its own feel, and mix/match combinations kept me busy for dozens of hours.  I also could not find an over powered combo, which means the game is very well balanced.

Overall, get this game.  Worth the full price, and a testament to where melee combat in VR is headed.","Apr 20, 2020 at 1:54 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:12:33.620401,FatSCRUBLORD,Nearly perfect,"This is one of those vr games that just feels great to play. Menus are really easy to navigate, game runs flawlessly and is incredibly responsive, and it screams character. Graphics and artstyle are very nice and it runs amazingly well on my 580 8gb with no stuttering or performance issues at all. There are many different weapons and playstyles to go for, with many upgrades available for all the weapons.  
  
There are a couple issues though, the blocking doesnt always register if you're moving too fast. You have to keep your sword in the blocking position for a moment until it registers, so in intense moments you may miss a block even though you really shouldn't have.  
  
Dodging is also kinda iffy as it seems to be registered by the movement, not your position. If you dodge bottom right and then immedietly have to dodge down you have to stand back up and then crouch, going from bottom right to bottom middle doesn't register as a dodge.

2022-05-28 20:12:33.651318,cScottD,Very Close to Being a 5-Star Game,"This is the perfect game for when you just want to spend a little time hacking and slashing things… but be warned: whenever you die, it’s very tempting to play just one more time, and then one more, and then one more, until you completely lose track of time. Seriously, it’s that much fun.

Admittedly, it’s a little light on content, but the developer has a good track record for adding more to their games over time. Besides, there are lots of different weapon combinations that have different effects and offer a different gameplay experience.

The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of two issues: [1] No option for smooth turn. The controls are otherwise great, with lots of options for different play styles, but the lack of a smooth turn option seems to be a glaring oversight, and I personally find it annoying. [2] Even worse, there is no option to reset the view. Even using the Oculus reset option doesn’t work, and this is the only game I’ve seen where that’s the case. This is especially a problem because sometimes when I start the game, I only see a “TURN AROUND” message and the only way to fix it is to exit and then reset the view inside another game.

One other positive that I feel the need to mention is that, unlike other games of this type, this one is handicap-friendly. I am severely handicapped, and can’t play games that require me to stand, bend down, or turn completely around. I can move my arms and upper body freely, but I still encounter a lot of games that are unplayable. This one works surprising well for me. I have some trouble dodging down sometimes, but otherwise it’s very playable (so far, at least), and has quickly become one of the games I play the most (at least until “I Expect You To Die 2” comes out *hint* *hint*).","Mar 11, 2020 at 3:17 PM",4, 14,

2022-05-28 20:12:36.833945,TheUnternerhmer,"Hahahaha, Vanquished!","This game, man.

From the moment you boot it up, you notice that it has been made by people who love what they do. There's a ton of detail, care and love in every detail.

This game is a roguelike room-clear hack-and-slash, with tons of (melee) weapons for you to choose from. The goal is to wail at the enemy while parrying their blows until their guard breaks, then slice and dice them with precise ""critical"" strikes. 
Each time you clear a room, you get a choice of three different items that will buff your character until you inevitably bite the dust. When you do, you get an overview of the rooms you have cleared and essence you have gathered, which you can then spend on permanently buying and upgrading new weapons.
TL;DR: Hades in VR.

The Graphics: Timeless, cartoony, very neon. I think they chose a style here that will age well throughout the next couple of years, giving this game excellent potential to grow.

Controls: I'm playing on Quest Link and I haven't had any issue with the controls. They're sharp, they're snappy, and still they give your weapons the weight you would imagine. (Hint: It's far easier to block with a dagger than it is with a made, because the mace has movement delay!)

Sickness: None, for me at least. Your mileage may vary, since they chose to make teleporting a resource-based action which has actual combat benefits. If you can't use smooth locomotion, my tip is to stick with weapons that don't increase dash damage.

Sound: Superb.

Gameplay: I really love the gameplay. Especially coming up with new builds based on what you are given each mission. But there's also the catch: I don't feel like I have enough control over what items I get, for me to be successful. I wish there was a way to have more control. Often I get choices that don't synergize well, forcing me to either waste my pick on health or Aether, or block one of the precious slots in my weapon with an upgrade I don't like. But that's a minor point.

Buy this game. It's a steal!","Jan 16, 2020 at 5:13 PM",5, 24,

As for the actual game, man this brings back memories. I used to love a couple of flash games on Newgrounds called ""Aeturnus Lamnia"" that were based on a similar principle--block by placing your sword over the prompts, attack when there's an opportunity. And this is beautifully executed.
The AI is smart... sometimes too smart. One will jump back when his guard is low, another will jump in when his friend retreats--or if his friend's guard is broken. Good variety of weapons, and each one *feels* right.
The daggers and cestus have reduced reach, the axe has a slow and heavy rotation speed, the sword is well balanced. I like to use both daggers for swift blocks, and the mage-like utility powers.","Jan 3, 2020 at 11:18 PM",4, 6,"Hi Johannason,
Since we don't yet officially support the Quest, we're not currently autodetecting your setup and it looks like it is defaulting to settings for a forward-facing 2-camera setup Rift. Luckily, there's an easy way to get around this until official support for your platform is added: Select Settings from the Pause Menu and then toggle on the ""Force Room Scale"" option in the Gameplay section. That should suppress any of those ""Face the Flame"" warnings and operate as intended for inside-out or other 360 tracking setups.

2022-05-28 20:12:43.215146,3rd-OrderDerivative,,"I'm not entirely sure what the other reviewers found so exciting about thisgame. Problems that I found (there are many):
     1. Graphics--Graphics are sub-par; think PlayStation VR graphics. Colors are oversaturated and therre's no detail in landscape or action sequences.
     2. Combat--Melee combat is utterly atrocious. Blocking offending sword swipes is a matter of waiting until an AI ""suggestion"" (which takes the form of a vertical blue color stripe. You're supposed to align your sword up to this blue stripe, causing the bad guy's sword swipe getting deflected. Problem is, the blue stripe shows up just microseconds before you're about to get hammered). No, you are not allowed to defend yourself when the bad gut strikes; youi're not allowed to place your sword where you think it should go. The game doesn't let you block swords yourself; you must align your sword up to the AI's blue stripe, or else you get hurt. Owie.
     3. Painfully agonizing repetitiveness. This game, all whopping, jaw-dropping, harddrive-busting 3.7 GB's worth of it, is little more than: 1. Beat up about 3 bad guys dressed in black outfits with bright green polka-dots. 2. Buy something (you're overwhelmed with a whole three different items to buy; two of which you likely can't yet afford). 3. Confront--and beat--a boss. 4. Repeat, with no significant change in graphics or play quality. I suppose you keep repeating this mindless exercise until all bosses are defeated; I don't know.
     4. Enemy vareity, or lack thereof. Even after the 5-hour mark (feels more like five months), the bad guys look the same: Witless humanoid individuals, just lounging around, wearing black outfits with scintillationg polka dots. If you get close enough, they may or may not decide to charge you.
     5. Cost: This is a free game (or at least it should be). $0.19 is too expensive let alone $19.00...

Limited upgrades provide meaningful choice, but it's all defined by what playstyle you enjoy. Combat involves breaking shields, then damaging health through precision angle-slicing streaks. Larger swings = larger damage. Weapon synergy is fun to figure out, and individually-charging ""super"" abilities reward using your two weapons in tandem, while carving out a niche for each as you complete levels. For example, you might build your sword as a shield-breaking machine, then your dagger as a primarily health-damaging weapon.

You are correct. We do need to add it and are discussing the most graceful way to integrate it during this Early Access phase. However, in the meantime, I hope you'll give the game a shot anyways. Beyond us auto-equipping specific weapons during the tutorial, there is no importance to handedness in the main game. Once you unlock weapon purchasing in the Runeforge (which happens after completing the initial tutorial and attempting your first run through the portal - win or lose), you can grab any weapon in your arsenal with any hand. There's no mechanic tied to a dominant hand. As you always have a weapon bound to your hand, you currently need a third weapon available to be able to swap. This doesn't excuse the lack of clarity in our current UX, but we'll be looking to address it before we leave early access. I hope you'll give it another shot with this knowledge in hand. If you have any other feedback, we're always listening to the community on our Discord ( https://discord.gg/untilyoufall ).
Good luck, Champion!"

It takes a very arcade approach from the retro-like theme music to the ""combos"" akin to playing a basic street fighter game. It can be as fast paced as you make it, providing multiple opponents and different angles of attack, counter attack, etc. I have yet to delve into all of the mechanics due to a single immense frustration. 

Edit: Thanks to advice from developers (quick reply thank you!) for setting room scale I was able to fix my issue and fully enjoy the game.  Now I am utilzing different fighting styles, progressing further and finding many different combinations available(equipment, fighting style, perks, etc.).

The turn-around prompts definitely sound like they're not behaving as intended.

1) From the Pause Menu (activated with the Y button), select ""Settings""

3) Toggle on the ""Room Scale"" option
That should disable any of the messaging about being turned the wrong way. The actual gameplay won't be any different in Room Scale mode, so it's not a problem if you have limited space.

2022-05-28 20:12:52.735987,Try4Ce,Addicting and challenging,"I heard about this game just recently and was directly hooked. I love Roguelite games as I also still enjoy ""In Death"" but really missed good meele combat, so Until You Fall just came at the right time for me.

First up - This game is tough. Way harder than I expected it to be. I died quite a few times even after the second and third stage and faced enemies I thought would be (mini)bosses only to discover they actually weren't. This game makes you learn attack patterns from the get go to survive. It makes you bite your touch controllers. And no, this is not a bad thing, it's a good thing. It gives me those ""Dark Souls""-esque feelings of challenge and accomplishment and the urge to finally beat that stage, to beat the next, stronger type of enemy.

The game itself is rather simple to understand - You start in your haven where you can buy and upgrade new gear with the collected Aether from previous runs. You even have a mannequin to test out gear and upgrades. Then you walk through the portal to start. And from there on, over and over again, slowly getting stronger. In terms of equipment, but everytime stronger in terms of gathering personal experience. Every type of enemy has a unique attack pattern and weakness. 

Visually this game is pretty great. It's not ground breaking, but unique. It has a nice weapon and monster design and is very colorful and pretty to look at. The effects are strong and dominant and in combination with the pretty great ""SynthWave""-style soundtrack and the very powerful sound effects during combat you really start to feel like a overpowered meelee ninja-like sword fighter. Sure, you die a lot, but every new run and fight feels great and every win ever more satisfying.

Controls are straight forward and very responsive - No hassle, no issues. Very fluent and direct.

Get this game if you love a challenge and a satisfying combat system - you wont be disappointed.","Oct 11, 2019 at 5:56 PM",5, 21,
