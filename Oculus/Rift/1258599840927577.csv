Awesome tour of the White House. I really appreciate the scale of everything shown.

I would definitely show this to my youngest family members when they get to an age to learn about Obama and how he involuntarily divided the country because of people in 12 of the comments here. I'm sure they knew this would rile up the red coats.",Oct 20 at 1:06 PM,5, 3,

Not too long and not too short, I felt like the 22 minute length hit the mark for a free, rather lite experience.  What puzzled me was the vantage point they give you. When Obama is sitting down in the Oval Office, the view seems right. The rest of the time your still at that same level, I felt like a kid on a tour of the White House, which is probably how they mean you to feel... lol. Not as heavily political as I thought it would be from other reviews, about what I expected. Overall, worth the time.","Jul 23, 2020 at 7:54 PM",4, 2,

The video has a lot of detail, it nearly feels like being there. I used Oculus Tray Tool to force super-sampling 2.0, it worked perfectly.

VR gives you a sense of scale in each room or office that pictures simply can not do. The scenes are narrated by the former-President and his wife. Well worth it for a historian like myself (i.e. Free).

It is a absolute privilege and great honor to be able to take tour through the real White House. Especially for a foreigner it's a big pain to get an invitation. So I had to skip that one during my trip last year.
But this VR-experience is really an excellent alternative. It was also nice to meet the Obamas again. It really feels like being taken around by the former president himself.

Thanks for everything, dear Barack and Michelle Obama. You served your country well. And I hope we are going to see more high-quality content like this from their successors.","Dec 18, 2017 at 4:44 AM",5, 11,

It's just a 360-degree movie, so you can't walk around and look around corners (because it's filmed, not animated), but otherwise it's a really fantastic experience. It's incredibly special to see around the White House and hear a bit about the history and the experiences of people living there.","Oct 29, 2017 at 11:27 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:37:47.018177,Fishhhooks,Moving and refreshing,"We Americans, as a people, don't know enough about our own government.  We don't know our history or our institutions.  And we're sorely lacking in humility and perspective.

Now, with a pompous bafoon berating that beautiful, meaningful building from within, it was wonderful and refreshing to hear the eloquence of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.  Their composure and dignity and self-awareness is so sorely missed by, at least, this American.

So, thanks to them and to the people who put this experience together.  It was moving and mournful.

Please don't do one for President Trump.  I have enough trouble thinking about him being in the White House without an immersive 3D experience making it all too real.","Sep 17, 2017 at 5:42 AM",5, 17,

What a sad existence to hate Obama so much that you download the video for the sole purpose of giving it one star.  How sad can your life be, really?  Well, if you don't know whether to download it or not, trust me it's a very good, well-made 360 video tour.  The quality is not the best, but it's up there.  Your jaw will drop when Obama is sitting there in front of you and you can see shine of his shoes.  It is only slightly political, it's mostly about the tour of the White House and the history there.  So you don't have to be a liberal to enjoy the tour.  Just a decent human being.","Aug 22, 2017 at 11:41 AM",5, 42,

As for Obama being the worst president; according to who? Do you people have any clue what a ""fact"" is? What ""evidence"" is? How about ""critical thought""? Of course you don't.

I say almost because it should have focused on that all the way, but there's a bit of politics to be swallowed every time you want to watch this. The resolution and quality is the best for this kind of experiences. And being two arm lengths away from the Obamas does deliver a sense of fulfillment. I'm also thankful that this experience was done in the time of barack obama.

Anyway... This app is really informative. It's well narrated and the video is decent. It's definitely not the killer app, but it's a really good tour of the White House. I have never visited there and probably never will since it now probably smells like coconut spray tan and KFC, so I am glad this will be available for kids to see what the White House was like before it became the White Trash House.","Aug 30, 2017 at 10:30 AM",5, 42,

The experience offers a great balance between the historical aspects of the White House's history and politics of the Obama presidency. This tour also gives you information about how Barack and Michelle spent their day to day life in the White House and a detailed examination of every room about its purpose and historical prevalence.

The immersive documentary is 22-minutes in length and allows anyone to step into the rooms of the White House and hear from the Obamas about their time in the residence.

One of the coolest parts is sitting right across from President and Michelle Obama and listening to them talk in full 3D. I miss them so much but with this app, I can visit from time to time.

At a few points, the narrator mentioned some object in the room but then the scene changed too quickly for me to look for it, and I had trouble using the pause menu with Touch controllers.","May 7, 2017 at 3:51 AM",4, 1,

2)The clintons murder mystery game (SPOILER) it was them


3)Obama game where you have to grab the nobel prizes and throw money to the Insurance Companys game 


4)The bernie sanders game where your surporters run up to you and you have to turn your back on them while catching money ...then when you get enough To buy a brand new Audi R8

5) or the Liberal Media fake news shuffle game

6) but my fave is the AL Gore Flight simulator where you avoiding the hot global warming spots and  fly your air liner all over (causing more hot spots) while collecting money

I could hear the crys of every dead solider that was caused by a rules of engagement set by Obama. The lies of an affordable care act which is OBAMACARE that turns out to not by affordable since costs have went up over x3 from when it was implimented. But... Obama... the one who was apparently so loved by the people because Beyonce said so... and turned out to be wrong because Obama was the one who let his special interests set the pricing and rip off americans under his Obamacare. Obama later gave amnesty to illegals with DACA which has an average age of people at 25 years old and goes against the constitution. It also turns out he wiretapped Trump and everyone called Trump crazy for saying so but it's on a breaking story on CNN so you know it has to be real dems.","Sep 22, 2017 at 1:04 PM",1, 44,
