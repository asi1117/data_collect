2022-05-28 18:41:27.516423,Martinspans,Wonderful Experience,"This is an excellent experience, especially if you have visited any of the places in real life. Very informative and the graphics are superb. The app is very easy to use and navigate and there is also an element of fun when moving around the various scenarios.
Customer support is also superb. I asked a couple of questions through their support page and I was given some excellent answers within hours. Thank you and I look forward to seeing new locations in the future.",Feb 22 at 10:33 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:41:27.531383,HotWasabiPeas,Fantastic virtual tourism app,"Amazing photogrammetry, and each location has a lot of nice little touches that add to the realism. Very polished and easily worth the price if you are at all interested in VR for virtual tourism. Can confirm cross-buy is enabled. I eagerly await the hinted future additions!",Dec 28 at 5:52 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:41:27.547341,Cullinarn,Hands Down the Best Virtual Presence App,"This is, by a large margin, the best virtual presence app focusing on real world locations to date. There isn't really anything else to say. There's nothing that even comes close to BRINK in the category in terms of total immersion and realism. Directional audio, photorealistic imaging, smooth UI/UX. Wow. Just wow. Been in VR since the early days of the DK1, and this brought back the magic. This is ridiculously good. If ever there were a case for crowdfunding DLC, this is it. Seriously: Put up a list of potential locations and take my money. The only actual criticism I have is that there is one spot in one of the many locations, that didn't scan or render accurately (a small panel of a rock face is actually in the air in front of a blank spot). Other than that? This is flawless, and very much what VR is for. I'm guessing it would take a lot of additional funding to do more locations outside of the US, so please consider crowdfunding.",Nov 10 at 11:23 AM,5, 6,"Thank you for your great review! New locations are coming soon! 

Also, remember cross-buy is enabled so give the Quest 2 version a try if you have a chance. You'll get the same experience as on Rift but with improved freedom of movement."
2022-05-28 18:41:27.562301,EngineerBot299,Utterly amazing,"This game (as the title indicates) is amazing and gorgeous. Don't have those thousands of dollars to go somewhere like Iceland? Just visit one of the waterfalls in Iceland in VR. The developers are still actively adding new environments and I can't wait to see what is to come. As the trailer suggests, that is actual game footage you're seeing and it's beautiful. Seeing the waterfalls in Iceland felt pretty close to when I actually saw them in-person.

(I'd like to disclose that I recieved this product for free. However it was out of the kindness of the developers as I am not in a financial position while I save up to get a car.)",Sep 10 at 9:54 AM,5, 34,
2022-05-28 18:41:27.578258,leo.bekmarmarchev,Beautiful! The best environments in VR,"Beautiful! The best environments ive seen in VR! Couple of things that would make it even better:
-The ability to interact with and pick flowers and grass
-Hand tracking support
-More graphic options for PC
-Just something to do in the environment for example something as simple as setting up a tent and playing a game in it whilst the day turns to night
-Interesting changes in the environment such as more animals typical to the location 

I think its an incredible base for some cool activities! Cant wait to see what the team does!",Sep 12 at 3:29 AM,5, 21,
2022-05-28 18:41:30.701903,bneiderman,Very impressed!,I have NEVER left a review for an app before which tells you something. This has got to be the best travel location app I have used. The 3D environment feels real not like that typical weird blocky and blurry photogrammetry stuff I am used to seeing. Very well done indeed! Can't wait until more locations are released.,Sep 10 at 7:33 AM,5, 19,
2022-05-28 18:41:30.717861,AteWaffle,"Great Experience, Beautiful sights!","I'm loving this so far, better than i expected. Its not like those blurry 3d images, the areas are so well detailed it feels like im actully there! One bug i noticed was when enabling night mode in Horseshoe Bend, the sky becomes pixly and distorted, other than that I have not noticed much. My suggestions are to add activities relevent to the area and if the player just came for the sights, they could turn activities off in the settings. Over all this deserves a solid 4 or 5 star, im very impressed!",Sep 14 at 5:21 AM,5, 10,
2022-05-28 18:41:30.732821,Lanzaboy,Excellent implementation,"More a geology (geoscience) lesson than a travel presentation and heavily weighted to North America. Non-the-less, an excellent implementation of VR. The  images are detailed and well used and the animated overlay is, for the most part, seamless. The tutorial and navigation helps make this so very good.",Oct 24 at 2:17 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:41:30.747780,zack.streetstar,Fascinating,"I downloaded it for the beautiful scenery and the remote locations, but the added interfaces of the compass and the narator teaching history, geology, and fun facts of the areas just put me over the edge (pun intended). Really great game and I hope they keep the locations coming.",Oct 20 at 2:06 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:41:30.762740,LonArt,An enjoyable travel experience,"Due to health reasons, my traveling days are over for the most part, so it was a pleasure to fire this app up on my Quest 2 and view a dozen or so locations that I'd normally be unable to visit.

The graphics are quite good.  The developers did a good job incorporating photo realistic backgrounds into the limited detailed areas that you are able to move around in.  I purchased this on PC and can say that this title looks and plays identically on both the PC and stand alone Quest 2.  

Visiting all of the available areas and collecting points of interest didn't take very long but the process was enjoyable, and the developers have more areas in the works.  Whether these new additions will be free or will be made available in DLC for purchase, remains to be seen.

Some additions I'd love to see added to this already fine app:

The ability to raise the level of the background audio.  My health condition also has caused me some hearing loss.  This app's sound is an important part of the immersion process, and I find myself straining to hear things like the wind, or the sound of waterfalls, etc.    The excellent voice narration is loud and clear but the environmental sounds need boosting.

More interaction with the environment around you.  In some areas you can pick up rocks and toss them off the edge of a cliff, yet in some areas there really isn't much to do other than search for the points of interest with your compass and take photos.   I think something like giving the player a pair of binoculars to take out and look at things in greater detail would be a nice start.  This could be incorporated into the search for POI.  Perhaps a search for various wildlife that are indigenous to the location along with a wildlife stamp collection booklet to log all of the species that have been found, complete with information about each one.

Finally, a detailed sky that is acurate to the location and time of year would be a very nice touch.   

All in all this is a great app.",Sep 24 at 12:40 PM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:41:33.861453,byronhinson,Excellent,"Great app and educational, it also doesn't cost much so it is well worth it. Only comment I'd make for an addition would be for the PC version to allow super sampling.",Sep 11 at 7:02 PM,5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:41:33.878407,SSBMMOOTSS64,Amazing Experience!,"I'm really enjoying the experience so far! Truly amazing to look at all the different locations. I had a problem with getting a free Oculus home environment, but the developers quickly resolved the issue for me, so that's awesome.

Such sights and sounds to see and I'm looking forward to what's coming next!",Sep 24 at 1:13 PM,5, 1,This seems to be an issue for people who purchased the app through the Rift store first.
