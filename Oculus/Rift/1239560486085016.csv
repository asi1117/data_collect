2022-05-28 18:14:08.215939,JoyousNightmare,Slow,"Managed to get through about the first planet before turning the game off out of boredom. Maybe it gets better and more engaging, but it starts off so painfully slow and doesn't give much indication of getting better.","Jun 26, 2019 at 1:02 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:14:08.232894,FastLawyer,Sound volume fixed + play local vs on PC,"Not as good as Holoball or Racquet NX but it's still pretty good. I would rank it alongside with Duo and Arcade Saga, especially now that the sound volume has been fixed and that you can play a match against another player on your PC with the addition of a gamepad it might even be better (assuming you have a friend / family to play against). This is the only racket game that I know that offers that type of multiplayer action on the same PC. I got it on the Rift Anniversary sale for $6 and was surprised by how much I was enjoying it after reading all the bad reviews. There's lots of variety. Each level is different whether it's different obstacles or upgrading your racket. The AI is not the best at the start, but really it's the obstacle course that's the challenge at the start and trying to get a perfect score. It's more like solving a puzzle and using the correct amount of force; think of it as a physical geometry focused chess match where you want to not just win, but completely route your dumbfounded opponent AI. However, I think it's odd that it always asks if you want to go Back or Retry. It never prompts you to go to the next level. You have to go back and then click on the next level manually. BTW, I played in standing room and was able to progress without much issue as long as you can reach the ground (but I do recommend a 3 sensor setup to make the game easier because there are some spots that you just can't quite get to so you'll need to move at least a little bit, but not as much as other racket VR games)","Apr 2, 2018 at 11:51 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:14:08.248851,ShaneLee79,,"Wonderfull game if you are into zero-gravity ballgames. Its sort of a futuristic take on Squash and could be compared to games such as ""Holo Ball"". I love it. There are a few minor things I would like to suggest to the developer(s) though (lets hope they read this review) 

1. The volume is still uncomfortably loud, the default sound should be toned down to atleast 50% of what it is now.

2. A simple menu of sorts should be made so players can adjust the volume, in-game music and supersampling at their leisure.

3. Once all the specialised tennis rackets have been unlocked there is nothing left to spend your earned points on. (I've got over 4000 unspend points and everything unlocked) so make some sort of a optional system allowing the players to upgrade their already unlocked rackets, making the rackets either bigger or more powerfull with every upgrade lvl. just make the upgrades realy expensive.

4. When the game starts its always the AI opponent who serves. Dev's should make it so that the player also gets the chance to serve the ball at the start of a new round.

5. One final minor suggestion: Change the name ""enemy"" you see at the beginning of each match to ""opponent"", I mean c'mon, this is not a warzone here and we're not exactly killing terrorists, we are playing a friendly match of zero-g Squash. The word ""enemy"" is inapropriate here. You use that word when fighting/killing hostile combatants not when you play a friendly game of zero-g Squash against cute looking fantasy opponents. lol","Jan 26, 2018 at 5:41 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:14:08.263811,raph81,Sloooow game play is slow,I'm not entirely sure it's worth the price I paid even though it was 50% off. Gameplay is about as exciting as amateur curling and the AI is one of the worst I've ever seen in a sport game. One of my oponents served three times in a row in a wall and proceeded to destroy his own crystal each time.,"Dec 4, 2017 at 6:32 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:14:08.278771,Xaervyn,RIDICULOUSLY LOUD VOLUME!!!,"Like my review title, the game has ridiculously loud volume. I was in the next room over, and my cousin had began playing this game, and I was afraid he was going to go deaf playing it. I had to adjust the volume of the Oculus device to 15%, when all other games are perfectly acceptable at 75%. As well, there appears to be no way to adjust this volume from in-game.","Dec 5, 2017 at 6:14 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:14:11.383467,salzziny,"good but ,,,,,","The music is too loud.
Why is there no sound control option?
Without this convenience
I think it's wrong to release.
And with the ability to watch
It would be nice to update in the future.

2022-05-28 18:14:11.398427,Conejeros,Fun,"The game is kind of fun, a bit repetitive but engaging and challenging. It should keep the ball in an area according with the available space. The graphics are pretty bad, nothing like the adverticement picture (no wonder why they haven´t put a video), it looks unfinished, but I guess is not on early access.","Oct 6, 2017 at 11:08 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:14:11.412390,MarquisDeSang,This is better than any real sports.,"Brilliant idea, brilliant sport, love the music, the visuals, the art, the feel and the ui. This game is perfect. It just needs antialiasing 4xAA or supersampling to remove the flickering and moire on the textures and polygon edges. An option to lower the music volume would also be great.","Oct 7, 2017 at 8:01 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:14:11.427350,Dozar,Bad AI hampers game,"The game has a variety of maps with nice visuals and music, however the gameplay is kind of dull. This is compounded by the fact that the AI is absolutely atrocious.","Oct 8, 2017 at 10:37 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 18:14:11.442310,Chiara,"Addicting, a good workout; can't reach!","This game has strong similarities to numerous other Pong-style games with an arcade techno aesthetic, including Proton Pulse (with Touch), and Danger Ball on PSVR. Like both these, the enemies get more difficult over time. What mainly distinguishes it is its upgrade system for your paddle and the beautiful 360 environments for each planet. The upgrade system is pretty compelling - you have to slowly earn points to buy them, but then you can keep them and use them as you wish, and you can mix and match them (a different one in each hand). All the enemies you meet have paddles you can buy, and your annoyance at their unfair advantage fuels your drive to save up to get the same paddle. My main complaint is that I got really frustrated any time I was unable to reach the ball, either because I was too short (I'm 5'6"", I had to jump a *lot*), or because the arena extended beyond my play space (this usually happened with the final level of each world). I also found it started out a little slow, with the first world being pretty boring. Additionally, you rarely have a reason to return to previous worlds since the point reward ramps up so quickly as you progress. I loved the 5 crystal system, in which it gets harder to break your crystals the less of them are remaining. It acts to keep the game close and exciting, and the sound of that crystal breaking right behind me made me wince every time (which is great negative feedback!)","Dec 29, 2016 at 4:01 PM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:14:14.527059,Kaitaya,Not Really Tennis,"Although this game is advertised as ""tennis,"" it really isn't a tennis game. As the player, you are paired 1-on-1 against a cute opponent (whether it's a robot or a little girl) with the goal of destroying their 5 crystals. To do this, you return the incoming ball past their defense and onto a crystal. The game reminds me of air hockey more than tennis. Sure, there is a racket and a ball but the concept of defending a vulnerable area gives it the air hockey feel.

This is one of my first VR games on the Oculus Rift. I was compelled to buy it due to its simplicity and cute graphics. The music is also pretty good. The only thing I don't like about this game is how some balls are nearly impossible to return. Either they return too fast that they're no longer visible or they are unreachable (even after jumping).

However, I would recommend the game to those who would like a quick simple game (that doesn't require any learning) involving rackets but isn't really tennis.","Jan 5, 2017 at 1:10 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:14:14.542019,mrgreen72,Fun little game!,"Well worth the money if you even remotely like this VR sub-genre. One thing though, for the love of dog please allow us to turn that mind numbing music off. It's downright aural torture.","Jan 13, 2017 at 5:51 AM",4, 1,
