2022-05-28 19:11:38.262326,FreeFallinMan,More than what I expected,"I've played many jigsaw puzzle games, but none that kept me wanting to go back for more as this one did. After a few minutes of tutorials, I was playing with ease. Very relaxing. If you are computer literate in any way, you can even follow the game's easy instructions on how to find spherical images and upload them to game for endless puzzle possibilities. You won't be disappointed.","Sep 28, 2020 at 6:35 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:38.278284,karen.cusimano,Much better than I expected!,"I've done other VR Jigsaw apps before, and been disappointed, so wasn't sure what to expect with this one. Must have played it for at least an hour tonight, possibly two, until my brain said ""okay enough!"" I like the fact that you can play them flat or spherical (I tried flat first, thought spherical would be a bit too tricky until I got a handle on the controls, but after I finished the first flat one, turned right around and did the same one spherical. Then twice more, adding more pieces. Then switched puzzles and did the first several levels of that one. 

For someone who likes jigsaws but can not really do them IRL because, well, we have cats, and cats + puzzles = missing pieces. So to be able to do them in VR is great! And no missing pieces!

Really enjoyed playing this. Can't wait to get back to it when it's not coming up on 2am.  :)","May 3, 2020 at 1:40 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:38.293243,SET-VR,How do I upload my own photos?,"I'm loving this app, but do not understand how to upload my own photos. We are running Windows 10, and if we have to create that file in the Users/user directory, do we put it in its own folder, or...?? I can't get how the game will know where to look for new photos. Please help! Thank you!  - and a further thank you for your very kind and timely response! I will try what you said and if I get jammed up I will email you.","Feb 8, 2019 at 12:02 AM",5, 7,"Thanks for asking. In Windows File Explorer, type the following into the box at the top where the current path / folder is shown: %LocalAppData%\VRnChill\photos

This is where you copy your files to. Any photos in this directory automatically appear along with the standard images in the game. Photos should be equirectangular format to show without any distortion. Thousands are available using this link: www.jumblivr.com/photos

Many photos work as .jpg but if you find the colours are not right you may need to load them into Microsoft paint and save it as a .png file to correct the colours.

If you need any more help or advice, please let me know. I don't get notifications when reviews are posted or edited so it's better to email me: brett@HeadStartDesign.co.uk

Thanks for playing :)"
2022-05-28 19:11:38.308203,odstmarine,My go-to for a relaxing VR experience,"This game brings together two of my favorite things, Virtual Reality and jigsaw puzzles. If you’re looking to take a break from shooting enemies or slicing blocks with sabers, this is one of the most relaxing VR experiences I’ve had. This game really takes jigsaw puzzles to the next level in the way that only virtual reality can. I love the idea and implementation of 360 degree puzzles. A really cool addition is that you can even add your own images to create new jigsaw puzzles. If you’re into puzzles and are looking for a relaxing VR experience this game is just for you and that price point can’t be beat!","Mar 5, 2019 at 11:38 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:11:41.436836,Tebsickle,Very satisfying and relaxing,"This game is extremely easy and relaxing, and after finishing a jigsaw puzzle, it becomes satisfying. Hey, for $2, you really can't go wrong here.","Jan 30, 2019 at 12:20 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:11:41.451795,lshanae,Very relaxing game,"If you are a person that enjoys jigsaw puzzles then this game is for you. It is a very calming and relaxing game, you start out with a few images to solve with a option to add more online  once i figure out how to resize the pictures  i can see myself spending hours on this game. Thanks to the develpers , I can't wait for updates to this game and more games in the future.","Dec 10, 2018 at 4:04 AM",5, 3,

My Quick Thoughts:
It does what it says on the tin! - A great experience with endless possibilities for adding your images and creating new Jigsaws.","Dec 13, 2018 at 5:20 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:41.480718,Gonzaxpain,Great app if you're into jigsaw puzzles,"Pretty unique right now, I don't think there is another app like this at the moment so if you like jigsaw puzzles this is highly recommended. Very well done, you can do puzzles in 3D or old-fashioned 2D (my favorite) and have tons of photos to choose from or you can include your own. Controls are good and easy and you can start a puzzle and save and finish it later which is a very welcome feature. As I said, if you like jigsaw puzzles, this is a great app even if you only use it from time to time.","Dec 10, 2018 at 10:29 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:41.495678,AVOlight,Enjoyable relaxing jigsaw experience :),"Starts out with a very helpful tutorial that's easy to follow. I really liked the relaxing music paired with the nature themed jigsaws in sphere mode, and the option to add your own custom scenes is awesome!","Dec 7, 2018 at 2:30 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:44.604364,UnknownFormat,Does exactly what it says in the title,"Great jigsaw app, nice and relaxing. Lets you use your own pictures as well. If you are into puzzles you have to pick this up","Dec 7, 2018 at 2:14 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:44.619324,mardarm,Puzzles are amazing in VR.,"This is the first of its type, offering endless opportunities as you can add your own pictures.
Was sceptical at first how this would work in VR but within a fews minutes (well it turned into an hour) was won over.
Tutoral very easy to follow and the controls are a breeze to master.
Have been using this to unwind after a hetic day. I could just sit back and listen to the backgound music.
If you need a break from the normal shooters and are into puzzles, well even if your not, can highly recommend this.
Big thanks to the develpers for bring something very unique to the oculus and can't wait to see what will come next.","Dec 15, 2018 at 7:06 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:11:44.634283,Fguillotine,very good experience,very relaxing if you are into classic puzzles. Controls works very well and image quality is pretty neat. Also the possibility to use custom images add a lot of value to the experience. Very recommended.,"Dec 8, 2018 at 6:41 PM",5, 2,
