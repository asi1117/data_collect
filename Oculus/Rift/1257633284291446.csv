2022-05-28 16:38:37.536424,savvito,Old but nice looking game !,"Don’t know why so many people say about bugs here I has none . The game is more like an interactive narrative game , there are puzzles but are quite easy . Graphics are quite nice , I have fought my self staring at the sea out of the window quite often .the story is quite interesting as well and makes you to keep up playing!","Jan 6, 2021 at 6:09 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:38:37.550387,G4mb10r,So Many Bugs,"So, I'll be honest, I got a bug on multiple play thrus and could never finish the game - and as far as I'm aware, these have not been fixed. The plot was so interesting that I watched a YouTube video just to see how it ended. So, 2 stars for great voice acting, beautiful setting, and a unique story, but too many bugs to even be able to complete the game and the puzzles definitely get repetitive after a while. REALLY wanted to love this game...","May 3, 2021 at 10:54 AM",2, 1,

I played for about 10 minutes but had to quit as that woman would not shut up! Unless you're a young woman who talks to herself a lot this game is not for you.

2022-05-28 16:38:37.580307,Archer1191,Great potential and great disappointment,"I really like the old fashioned scifi mystery feel to the game, the atmosphere, and the mansion. The gameplay for repetitive quickly and the puzzles became annoying and boring after a couple repetitions. The physics of the gravity tool were a little bit screwy and I kept getting stuck in objects with a black screen. The controls frustrated me since the grip was on the wrong button and you could not move with the same hand you held the wand with. Finally the ending ruined the experience. I was hoping for a good plot twist, but only found disappointment in the direction the story took. Even though I purchased the game for 60% off, it still was not worth it for the over all dissatisfaction I felt in the end. I would recommend avoiding this game.","Sep 3, 2019 at 10:47 AM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 16:38:37.595267,Drowdragon,At least making a mess aint gamebreaking,"As much as i liked the atmosphere and the gameplay til about the ending (which i don't want to spoil but it felt like ""mua ha ha ha cliché plottwist ending"" after all the plot potential that they were trying to build imo?) trying to do things in an orderly manner is a bit hard in this game. Everything is thrown around as you try to figure where the piece you need went to. I'm also still not sure what the additional counter on the devices is good for, is there another hidden ending if i find ALL the lights that i missed? Some people might feel at loss as to what do/where to go next trying to figure which location your guide is talking about. However the puzzles are reasonably fun ( relaxing though not very complex or anything) and it has a very nice magical atmosphere. And fortunately i did not encounter any bugs. All in all i still enjoyed it.","Aug 27, 2019 at 7:22 PM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 16:38:40.749830,Drazzak,,beginning of the game was interesting but for a mystery type game didnt see any clues about anything just find the orbs and complete the puzzle  which made the ending feel like a slap to the face  would been nice to use free locomotion but kept getting stuck on everything when i did and kept getting annoyed with the ball of light trying to tell me what to do making that optional would have been better IMO,"Jun 1, 2019 at 5:05 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:38:40.763793,Draco Stargazer,TORN is Excellent!,I really enjoyed the great graphics of the game and the way it led me on. Quite a twist on the outcome. Didn't expect it. Great Fun!,"Jun 7, 2019 at 12:18 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:38:40.778752,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Well produced.,"The game has good graphics, and good art assets- every item has a neat detail to analyze- which is a good thing for a VR game. There are a few bugs but overall the game is well made. The voice acting was decent. The mansion looks great and the physics of moving stuff around- despite being wonky at times, was impressive in performance with nearly all world items being movable. And you are going to move those items- you are going to tear all the rooms apart and make a big mess. 

A few cons. One is that the floaty light dude is always nagging and giving unsolicited advice. I am a chill dude and I audibly said ""shut the - up"" many times. It is THAT bad. Non stop nagging and barking the most obvious things. Is the intended audience 5 year olds? The puzzles are VERY basic, with absolutely no assistance needed to solve- and if you spend more than a minute shuffling the pieces around- the dude chimes in a jerkish, loud sigh, ""Maybe you should try turning the piece-"" like you were the not smart enough to tie your shoelaces. Let the player explore your game at their own pace!

Another gripe was the collectibles aspect. While playing, if a world object jumps like it is possessed, that means there is a collectible orb in it, which releases upon picking the object up. My OCD made me scour every item for these orbs. This extra ""quest""- I learned through much wasted time- was buggy-- objects with orbs sometimes didn't move. And the game needed a quick game reload to resolve the issue. Anyways, a waste of time in more ways than one because these collectibles, seemingly don't do anything. Doesn't affect the story and no achievements.

Final thought is that Torn isn't crapware, which is worth mentioning in these early VR days. It is an okay walking simulator with solid production value and a neat story (not the greatest story with a twist Shyamalan ending-- but okay for video game standards). I recommend it but wait for a sale.","Apr 17, 2019 at 5:06 PM",4, 8,

The trailer has sound and voice. Is this intentional for the game? It's the only game or app I have ever had this issue with if their is something I am missing. It would add a lot to the game. The exploring and puzzles are enjoyable but this confuses me.,"May 8, 2019 at 9:51 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:38:43.894419,richcsst,,"First my complaints:

The latter half of the game has crashing bugs.  For me they started when attempting to go downstairs to the kitchen.  Just entering the stariwell usually caused a crash.  You have to positition yourself just right to get around that annoyance.   Frequently, when exiting the alternate dimension it would crash on level load, but restarting got you past that more annoying annoyance.

Finally, when exiting the alternate dimension after finding the last key, it just crashes, and apparently the autosave is no good, as when you try to get back in, it crashes and crashes etc.  It looks like I will likely have to start all over again because you have no control over game saves, and the autosave is all you get.

The controls could have been better mapped to the controllers, as they really don't make any sense.  Trigger instead of grip to grab things?  Wierd movement without strafing.

The good:

When it works, it is a nice puzzler with an intriguing story.  There's great acting, and the characters have personality.

I like how they give respect to the C64 (you'll see).

The puzzles are interesting, and even though it is suggested where to go next, you don't have to.  You are free to explore and solve puzzles in any room.  This is a casual puzzler, and should be simple enough for most, although, while finding puzzle pieces and placing them, things can be very messy.  I am not a clean freak, nor a slob, but if you have ""issues"" with cleanliness, remember, it's just a game.  Make a mess.

I have two GeForce 1080 GTX cards in SLI, and maxing out the settings are no problem.  I hear this works fine with a single 1080 card as well.

I would have rated this with five stars, but the crashing and the frustration it causes are too much to ignore.

Suggestions for improvement:

Fix the crashing! 

Fix the movement, and cater it to the Rift, if it's running on a Rift.  Grip is grab, move with strafing, and no snapping if the user doesn't want it.","Mar 9, 2019 at 3:22 AM",3, 16,

2022-05-28 16:38:43.938301,SayBass,Enjoyable Point-&-Click Adventure in VR,"I found this experience to be similar to the Point-and-Click adventures of my youth, so suffice to say, I loved it. 

The environs are beautiful - the Mystery-in-a-Victorian-Mansion theme reminded me of games like ""7th Guest"" or '''Alone in the Dark"". There is a lot of interactive elements and rooms to explore. The voice acting was very good, IMO. 

The puzzles are pretty repetitive after a while, but never difficult.

It's not everyone's speed, but I'm glad I played this.

One small suggestion to the developers: I am deaf in one ear, so whenever the audio moved to that side, I had to twist around to hear - and sometimes the scene being described was out of view. Not a big deal, but an option to adjust the panning would have solved this for me.","Mar 13, 2019 at 7:20 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:38:47.033025,artyon,Pretty weird.,"I got stuck in the walls. That said, by switching my locomotion mode from walking to teleport a few times, I was able to complete the game. The plot is.. odd. It's no lone echo but great for fans of puzzle games. Mostly you find and grab objects and push them into their correct positions. 

There are a few puzzles that force you to think however, and although they are fair, they are rubiks-cube style challenging. That is, once you uncover the strategy required they become time-wasters. All said, it was a fun game, but about equally fun as spending the same 6 hours in front of netflix.

My one wish for future updates for future players is better locomotion; If the ""run"" speed was 2x I would not complain at all. Also annoying was that light buddy was constantly announcing ""this way"" even though I was headed in their direction, especialy in the last level.

So, 4 stars. It was a good time that didn't leave me feeling unsatisfied, but it did leave me feeling a bit confused, but not because of the staightforward (often fun?!) puzzles. The plot is.. like I said.. odd.","Mar 14, 2019 at 2:53 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 16:38:47.061947,cScottD,"Lots of potential, but disappointing","I really wanted to rate this game higher, but it just has too many problems. First off, the good: The game looks amazing and the initial story is intriguing. It is also pretty immersive -- or it would be, if it weren't so easy to get stuck. I always prefer free-movement mode, so I immediately switched from teleport mode to walk mode. Unfortunately, the lack of smooth turning makes movement a bit awkward and it's too easy to get stuck and have to switch back to teleport to free yourself. The puzzles are simplistic, but I'm okay with that, because I really enjoyed the exploration and unfolding story. The hints though are straight-up annoying. He constantly offers suggestions, whether you need them or not, and the few times I was genuinely stumped, he offered no help at all. The biggest problem however, is the ending. It's just a long mess of exposition with a ""twist"" that is far less interesting than what we had been told was happening, and the more I think about it, the less sense it actually makes.","Feb 3, 2019 at 7:39 AM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 16:38:47.077904,Doodlebugz32,"Great game, but...","The graphics and story were amazing, the movement system was ok and gravity tool was great fun tossing stuff around using it to solve the objectives.
The ""puzzles"" didn't really exist, it was more like those toys we had in pre-school where you fit certain shapes into the holes. I bought it for puzzles but stayed for the story.
Even with the lack of puzzles I would have given 5 stars except by the end I wanted to strangle that little floating orb so badly I actually screamed out loud and scared my family ""Shut the **** up"". Everytime you walk by the teleport device he comments that it's not time yet. Everytime he wants you to follow him near the end he comments that you aren't keeping up over and over but you can only teleport a fraction of the distance he traveled, and many more annoyances. There NEEDS to be an option to turn off the ""help"" feature and only turn it on when you need it. Also the one time I did need help when I was trying to figure out how to open the locked doors he never told me anything, it took me 20 min to figure it out. (Put the device in the door, then grab the device about halfway as you can't grab the tip).
I figured out how to put him away for some of the time but he just pops back out after a while.

Summary: The story was great and not meant for small children, yet the puzzles definetely felt that way. Needs a bit of tweaking to make it a better game.","Jan 30, 2019 at 2:12 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:38:47.092864,RuneSR2,Awesome game - you need to try this!,"This is an amazing game - ok, maybe not the most amazing VR experience ever, but still pretty amazing and truly fascinating. I forced super sampling 2.0 and expected the worst, but the game ran great, usually at 90 fps or very close on my oc'ed GTX 1080. Even using post-processing=EPIC. The I added anti-aliasing=EPIC, and the game still ran awesome. If fact I didn't really observe any performance penalty when going from antialiasing=off to antialiasing=epic. Btw, antialiasing worked just fine, but I did find antialiasing=epic too blurry and ended up with antialiasing=low (+ ss 2.0 + post-processing=epic). 
Generally textures were great/nice, far better than Apex Construct, although both games have some PSVR texture leftovers, but many/most textures in Torn seem to have higher res on the Rift. Touch controls were nicely implemented, though I would have preferred smooth turning and ability to run (faster walking speed is achieved when holding done a button, but it's still quite slow). 
Normally I'm not that fond of puzzle games in a dead-ish world (with limited social interaction), but this didn't happen in Torn thanks to the ""Tinker Bell""-like presence/entity (no spoilers here :-) 
Maybe some puzzles are too easy or slightly awkward/repetitive, but so far to story is awesome and I'm looking forward to get back!

Most of the time you are looking for symbols on objects which have to match symbols on the floor, the walls or the ceiling. This is 90% of the gameplay.

2022-05-28 16:38:50.240446,Fleetstar,Not much here !,"This is the worst VR game I have played to date, visually it is great but that's as far as it goes. The story is awful, its repetitive and way too easy. I found myself continually trying to turn of the helper who was telling you what to do all the time,  and the last 3 levels were absolutely awful regarding puzzles (there weren't any) You just walk round following instructions the whole time.
The finale was the best, I just stood there with my arms folded listening to narration for about 10 minutes. I think I need to be a bit more careful how I spend my money in future.","Oct 25, 2018 at 3:50 AM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 16:38:50.256403,sa_motion,Good potential but flawed controls,"The game seems to have quite a bit of potential but is marred by a plethora of control issues which unfortunately shouldn't have existed. Turning using controller direction is bugged right now, so if you start walking in a certain direction you cannot change that unless you stop walking, pick a new direction and start walking again. There is no strafe movement either. This greatly prevents ease of aligning oneself with any environment interest point like a switchboard etc. Some people are complaining about lack of smooth turn which I can somewhat agree with as well. All these are relatively minor issues to implement from a development standpoint but immensely effect player experience. I will update my rating once/if these issues get resolved. 

Another issue is the physics collision of hands with the world. Due to jitter and approximate collision volumes which don't exactly match the visual representation this ends up breaking immersion more than it enhances. A quick fix would definitely be to disable physics collisions with the second hand when the first hand is holding an object. I keep colliding the object I am inspecting with my second hand when that is not my intention.

These somewhat trivial to implement but important issues prevent a proper appreciation of the game where it stands today.","Aug 29, 2018 at 11:35 PM",3, 19,

VR is supposed to be immersive, this isnt at the moment, no matter how much i want it to be :( I'll hold off playing till updates are released, i want to enjoy this game so will wait.","Aug 29, 2018 at 7:51 AM",3, 17,

The game lets you walk, BUT the same joystick will make you snap turn!! So your constantly snaping around on accident and trying not to puke because of it! How hard is it, in 2018, to just have REGULAR controls in a game!! LEFT stick move feet, RIGHT stick move head! This has been the norm for over a decade but so many VR games are clueless!!! 

I'll update my score to 5 stars once the controls are fixed. And for the love of all things holy, let us remap the controls! There are several things that just don't make sense right now that would be such an easy fix and make the game shine!

Controls 1/5

UPDATE: Well its been over 13 months and not a single word or update from the developer. The game is completely unplayable for me in its current state.

2022-05-28 16:38:53.364091,Kenjay,The sort of thing I'd been waiting for,"I REALLY enjoyed this game, it was atmospheric and about the most immersive experience I've had with VR.  I only wish it was longer and had more replay potential.  There were times when I almost felt I was there.  There were issues though.

I played sitting down in a relatively confined space, so the controls were very hard to manage, many of the actions involve reaching, grabbing, and moving things with your ""hands"", and unless you're standing in a room, that's really hard, the range just isn't there.  I also got stuck in the scenery frequently using the ""walk"" mode, but switching out and jumping to another area fixed that.  There were a couple of crashes, but the game recovered.  Some of the mechanics can be confusing, such as a couple of situations where rooms became unsolvable, but quitting and re-entering fixed those too.  Altogether, I'd like to see more like this.  Most of the similar games are jump-scare-fests, and I'm not a big fan of those.  Torn was a very good balance, even if the ending wasn't what I expected.","Sep 2, 2018 at 10:31 PM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 16:38:56.515662,Shottski,Decent Experience,"Quick Summary: A decent VR puzzler with an easy and fairly flat learning curve that can be finished within 5 hours. The atmosphere and visuals are good but the conclusion to the journey isn't worth the effort. If you're a fan of the genre, play other available puzzlers first and pick this up once on sale.

Detailed Review: The puzzles in this game plateau quickly and the same mechanic of connecting items/furniture to walls/floors is used throughout. Although repetitive, it wasn't entirely unenjoyable as the visuals are nice and clicking puzzle elements into place does give satisfying feedback. Completing each puzzle unlocks orbs which are ostensibly needed to advance the story. However, each room has extra orbs and finding them (or not) had no obvious effect besides changing the count on the ""barometer"". The story would be my biggest gripe  and I don't feel the payoff was worth the effort. The character's passivity, utter lack of curisoity, and unwillingness to question the troubling signs around her were difficult to accept. Additionally, the ending had very little connection to most of the elements and themes introduced earlier in the game and frankly just felt nonsensical for a number of reasons.

I had no performance issues with the game.  I'm running a GTX1080 with a Ryzen 2700X.  I did have one crash but didn't lose any progress since it happened at a checkpoint.

Some of the regular VR options are present. You can teleport or use smooth locomotion (which I used). Smooth locomotion is terribly slow (except if you hold the left trigger which increases it to a more acceptable pace). The left thumbstick does double duty (except if your gravity gun is holstered) of controlling movement as well as turning. This is an annoyance but one that I was able to get used to without too many mishaps. There were times where my character got stuck but only after I had moved lots of objects close to my location. I was freed once I made space.

Hope this helps! Enjoy VR!","Sep 4, 2018 at 10:48 AM",3, 16,

Unbelievaby repetitive...unless you dont mind picking objects up and sticking them to a wall...over and over and over again...

The blink option for the locomotion was tedius....be prepared to keep clicking to move 2ft each click.

But using the walk option will get you stuck over all the funriture and objects you move...the ones you stick to the wall. Mustve gotten stuck over 20x...had to switch to blink locomtotion just to pry myself out.

this is the first game i requested a refund for","Sep 24, 2018 at 1:51 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 16:38:56.545582,yeslad,"Lovely, but terrible locomotion","The game itself is beautiful and the attention to detail is great. The credits sequence at the beginning was a brilliant way to open the game, but actually playing it? Well, it didn't feel so good. It is incredibly repetative, because all you are doing throughout the game is rearranging furniture to unlock another puzzle. It feels like such a waste of a beautiful game. It doesn't take long to get bored, with it being the same thing over and over again.

I'm not sure if the distance of teleportation was restriced with it being the beginning of the game, because it would only jump about 4 feet. This didn't bother me, as I prefer to use walking for the best experience, but the controls and locomotion are *really* terrible. You turn using your head, which doesn't sound too bad, but you cannot walk sideways, so you cannot move in a straight line and look around, you can't follow a path and look to your right as you walk because you'll just walk to your right. Sideways walking and smooth rotation is needed and I'm shocked the developers went for what is used now, especially since both sticks rotate... Also what is it with games using the trigger for grabbing! Stop it!

Another thing that I could not settle with in this game was the voice acting, especially your main character, the girl. In the first quarter of the game she sounds really disconnected, being so optimistic and upbeat after all that is going on. It just doesn't fit. Her tone is just too fake, like she is reading it to you from a book.","Sep 6, 2018 at 6:41 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 16:38:56.561539,vdwtanner,Wonderfully Crafted World!,"I absolutely love the world that the devs have created! It's gorgeous, and there's so much to interact with! I have enjoyed solving the puzzles so far, and the cloth and tearable materials were a happy surprise too :) 

My only complaint with the game is that walk direction is tied to the head's forward vector, so you can't really walk around and enjoy the scenery at the same time, which is a shame because it is so pleasant to look at. Not a huge deal since you can just choose not to move, but still takes you out of the experience more than I would like.

A minor mention is that, as has already been noted before, you grab with trigger in this game instead of the grips, which is somewhat annoying, but doesn't bug me too much.

Looking forward to playing the rest of the game! Thanks for the gem!","Aug 30, 2018 at 12:29 PM",5, 4,

Torn will surprise you, it will inspire you and it will blow you away. The attention to detail is second to none and everything about this game just oozes quality, care and attention. It's very rare we get a game of this quality in VR and its a game I would want to show people NEW to VR for the first time.
During my initial game-play session I couldn't help wondering what a Half Life 3 or Portal 3 game would be like in VR, and this game sets the bar for that kind of experience, and I did get some of those vibes from this title alone.
This game is full of surprises, mystery, finesse, is unique and everything fits into place perfectly, the art style, the graphics, the music and the story telling.
My only complaint was the walking felt too slow at the start of the game, but I soon found a button to make me move a little bit quicker.
I would also like to see smooth turning.","Aug 30, 2018 at 3:08 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 16:38:59.654267,Chris_Lee99,,"The game itself is nice and enjoyable, but have many bugs still. After few hours of playing i found myself bugged in large room with stairs when trying to cover spot on cellar.  Instantly was thrown to black place where i can hear im doing something but cannot move anywhere. Reload game doesnt help.  If game have some stuck bugs i like to see any option to  unstack and  teleport to safe place without be forced to  play whole game from beginning.","Sep 9, 2018 at 6:37 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 16:38:59.669227,nrosko,Decent game so far some dissapointments,"I'm about half an hour in so i can't say too much about this game but i feel i can't progress with current controls. 
Lets start with the graphics (highest settings on epic x2.0) half an hour is enough to judge them. Graphics are good, the world is fairly well detailed, textures are not as good as some other games but better than avarage. Lighting & shadows not so good but you will be impressed overal with your surroundings & the general level of detail.  
But here is my first major critism there seems to be no AA in the game, so lots of crawling edges. I thought this was a bit dissapointing, its more an issue when looking into the distance but still my gfx card is only running at 35%. Forcing it through Nvidia doesn't work either I hope the devs may add SMA or TXAA as an option. 
Puzzles seem easy so far but thats ok its still quite fun up till now. You move stuff about with your special tool to solve the puzzles. This works ok apart from the angle of the tool seems setup for vive. The general vibe of this game is very light & the voice acting is somewhat hammy but general production quality is very good. I just wouldn't be expecting to be challanged or discover anything deep if you consider buy it. 
Unfortunately i just couldn't continue with the current control setup. You can select normal locamotion but choices to steer are by looking(which i hate) or by snap turning(which is useless). Not sure why devs fail at getting these things right. There either needs to be an option to smooth turn or use the direction of the touch. 
If these issues are addressed i will continue with game & hopefully bump up the score.","Aug 30, 2018 at 5:53 AM",3, 11,

2022-05-28 16:38:59.700145,SpicyAftermath,Personally think this is one of the best,"give it a shot... and by shot i mean get used to the controls (grab button... dont get me started) . well the controls might not be what u are used to but in this case the getting used to is worth it. the score, art-design and story will be your reward. a bit depressing towards the end.","Sep 1, 2018 at 7:00 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:39:02.773923,Acnetits,Sweet,"Really enjoying the game atmosphere, story, and puzzles so far. If you're on the fence about it, I would highly reccomend getting it. The only thing that  needs improvement are the touch controller grab button, and locomotion. Otherwise very good game, once you get used to the controls.","Sep 4, 2018 at 1:53 PM",5, 4,
