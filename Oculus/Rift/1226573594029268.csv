2022-05-28 13:38:33.911433,ThePaladin,Awesome Hidden Gem,"In how many other VR games do you get to command and navigate your own starship, beam aboard other ships and/or space stations, grab tech from the enemies you defeat, upgrade your starship, command a starship crew, and travel through space???  Ummm... none that I can think of!!  This game awesome and by far one of the best VR games I own and have ever played.  I'd say try and get it on sale if you can, but if you can't, I think it's still worth the $40 (and I don't like spending a lot of money on games).  It's got some replayability, and don't get frustrated if you don't win the first or second or third time; that's part of the fun!

 The only downside I can think of is that when you lose, you lose; i.e. you start over from scratch with nothing and there is no going back to a previous save. It would have also been cool if you could interact with your crew.  All in all, I have really enjoyed this game in spite of these shortcomings.",22 days ago,5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:38:33.926393,aREALLYBUFFDUCK,Loving this..,"Want a good VR Rougelike? Tired of all the teleport archer/mage games? Ever want to play FTL in VR with friendship, and actual away missions? This... absolutely this.  The only downside I see is not being able to move to abandoned ships and commandeer them but this is so much fun. I would say,  if you plan to purchase this game for coop, make sure you have friends that want the game as well. Online matchmaking is a rough go. Add me if you want to COOP! Would be fun to have others to play this with.",8 days ago,5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:38:33.942352,SamuraiWerewolf,Great Game,"This was one of the first game I played on the Oculus Rift way back in 2017 and it was amazing for its time.  Teleporting to enemy ships or space stations and having shoot outs with space pirates or aliens was great.  I hope the devs can take this idea and update to the new hardware available and add some more options and gameplay.  I think it woudl still be great.  With the larger VR audiance of today, I think it coudl be a hit.  Not enough co-op multiplayer games for Quest.",May 2 at 1:26 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:38:33.958308,DeuceDropper,"It's cool, but not $40 cool.","I've enjoyed this game. There may not be much to it, but it's a fun little romp with friends.
However, it does not quite make sense for this game to STILL cost $40. I was planning on buying an extra copy to play with my wife, expecting to get a few hours of fun out of it, but it doesn't feel right to spend $40 on a four year old game that is no longer being supported or updated, with a non-existent online player base. Even most triple A game developers these days will drop their prices to under $30, usually $20 or below, once their game reaches its third birthday. Please, Gunfiregames, put it on sale or lower the price to something more fair for its age and lack of support, and people will buy it again, including me. Then I'll do a full playthrough with my sweetheart and write an updated review.",Dec 18 at 3:25 AM,3, 64,
2022-05-28 13:38:33.973268,Recapitator,Great game with one fatal flaw,"One of the very few games that I consider almost unplayable not because of bugs, but because of balancing. Every Enemy is either so weak it would take minutes to kill you, or so overpowerd you have to empty 3 entire weapons into it (I am not even talking about bosses here) The sad thing is, without the balancing issues this could be one of my favourite VR games.",Feb 18 at 6:08 AM,2, 2,

Can we increase the team to 4? 6?

Side note:  My buddy is getting Win64-Shipping.exe error with his brand new computer.  We cannot play until this is resolved.   This has been my #1 recommendation to my friends but I cannot do that anymore until this is resolved.",Jan 22 at 12:54 AM,4, 5,

It's an FTL plus enjoyable shooter plus VR. 
Not many stupid stuff to do with friends, but it's a really good game as far as I've seen. 

It doesn't work with virtual desktop though, fatal error when starting the campaign, works perfect with airlink.",Nov 19 at 7:34 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 13:38:37.142383,GuitarzanWIZ,An expert's review...,"I have been playing this game for about 3 years. I have met many people, in game, who have been playing it for two years -who haven't beat it yet. I've literally beaten it hundreds of times. Some think it's too hard or impossible. I will admit it took about 20 initial, very intentional and dedicated tries to get through it the first time; but it gets easier after the first win (you get a stronger ship). The game forces you to make smart decisions (like always make sure you are fully healed and ready for anything before you make a jump). Although my skill is now at a level that I have to invent ways to challenge myself (like never upgrading med bay, only using weapons I find instead of my award weapons, and never using wrist the map) I still find the game very entertaining and play it often. The reason it seems like nobody is ever online in this game, is because when there are lots of people with open games, some people are jerks when they come into your game and start sabotaging your ship...so everyone starts setting their games to private. I almost always keep my games public and just kick any losers that join. This is an excellent game that will give most people a great many hours of enjoynment. Hope to see you out there :)",Jul 23 at 1:18 AM,5, 18,
2022-05-28 13:38:37.157343,SteveThurston,Could have been one of the best ever,"I really enjoy this game, its a shame the devs didn't continue on with it.
I recommend this game even as it is (preferably when on special)

IMO a couple of things that would have made it one of the best are:

There are casino chips/cards on some of the tables, as a multi player game, if the players could have had a quick card game or played darts or even checkers or chess it would give a complete change of atmosphere and opened up a new area to relax and have a laugh in game, games in a game.
The lockers should be able to be opened with random loot, (more loot in general through the whole game.)
Some of the items on the other ships boxes/containers/equipment look like they were designed to have been interacted with, this would have been so cool
When saving other captains from bot rebelions etc you should be able to save the captain from a safe room and have some interaction with them.
Have ways of upgrading weapons and armour, even change charaters hair styles or tatoos etc.
More things saved and carried over after dying and starting a new adventure.

If there is a group out there trying to get the devs reinvolved or if they have a patreon please let me know.

Personally I think this could have been one of the all time talked about games.",Jul 2 at 6:39 PM,4, 34,
2022-05-28 13:38:40.272162,JrSpaceMan,FTL in VRrrrrrrrrrr,"Great game.  Simple and to the point.  Been playing it for years.  Bought 2 more headsets just to play multiplayer (over a 5 year period).  Wish this would get ported to Steam or updated for the Quest/Rift S so more people could experience it.  It's hard to say what makes this game so great, just feels like more than the sum of it's parts even though is basically FTL in VR and the missions all bleed together with little variation.  If you don't have it, just buy it and play for 20 min, you'll be hooked.","Jun 19, 2021 at 6:49 AM",5, 10,

I've tried reinstalling the application. I've tried updating Oculus to the Public Beta. I've tried setting graphics to default in the game.

I can get to the title menu, but the moment I try to launch a game or even go to the tutorial, the Oculus view freezes and on the Desktop there's a pop up that says ""Fatal Error"" and just an OK button.

I got mine to play it but it's connected via USB using the Oculus link, so it is possible.............. just purchased it and played today. So far...The graphics and outline is great! easy to use controls. However, it feels like it's lacking in some way. For one. There are not enough ppl to join up with. The game is 3-4 years old with no updates. I love the idea but one thing that really turned me off. I made one mistake of fighting a pirate and they blew me up in less than 10 seconds. The game did not continue nor did I respawn. You have to start over!!!! Would be nice to fly the ship around and land on some planets with an outpost. Come on guys! the technology is here!

I recently picked this game up after doing some research on a value game for the price. FOS did not let me know down. This is what VR should strive for. This isn't just your standard, follow this path way, or where do I go next, or point and shoot game. This game involves using strategy and the freedom to explore different options to get ahead. I love how this game as me ploting my next move even before I re-enter and i'm only just getting started. Of course like all VR games playing multi-player is amazing!!

This game has the skeleton of the greatest mmo in the history if time. It's such a shame it seems to have stopped developing. 

If you're not going to do anything with it, at least release the code so others can add the modifications that will make it truly epic.

2022-05-28 13:38:46.668759,GinBroguesHats,A demonstration of what VR can be.,"I was creeping around a space station that someone had asked me to investigate. They had a problem with bugs. The things were nasty beetles about the size of a dog that liked to spit acid. Not exactly pleasant but the money was good. I had the station mostly cleared apart from one last bug that was behind a secure door. As I walked through the station *ahem* acquiring things and looking for a security pass. SOMETHING LEAP OUT OF A VENT AT ME. I screamed so much my wife asked me if I was okay.

When it's good (with other players) this game is incredible, and even solo it's brilliant. It's honestly one of my favourite games of all time because even with the fairly limited structure and levels it *feels* like being in a sci-fi film from the 70s that only came out on VHS.

I don't think I've ever recommended a game to more people, and honestly I'm writing this review in part to remind the makers that there are people out there who still love it and would do terrible things for some DLC.","Jul 1, 2020 at 4:11 AM",5, 31,
2022-05-28 13:38:46.684716,Anomalous2141,Dear 5 Stars: What Game Are You Playing?,"Is it the same game I'm playing?  The same unbeatable permadeath rando-mess of a game that is functionally unplayable alone?  I don't get it.  Why all the 5-star reviews?  What am I not getting?  Is there a great game bereft a decent tutorial?  Are you all playing multiplayer?  Is there something I'm not getting!?  What the ****, people!

It's taken me a long time to write a review of this game because I didn't want to admit that such a highly polished, visually appealing game could be built into a completely flawed and useless premise.  You need to gather enough resources to buy fuel to make jumps, but don't stay still for too long or you'll get overrun by unbeatable enemies.  But don't jump too many times either or you'll run out of fuel and get stranded.  There's no structure to the game because all encounters are randomized.  Sometimes you'll get your *** handed to you by over-difficult enemies before you've had a chance to gather more powerful weapons, other times you'll just run out of fuel and get run over by the enemy hoard.  Either way: Earth goes boom, Game Over start all over again.

Seriously, Gunfire, this game sucks.","Jun 26, 2020 at 6:31 AM",1, 17,

2022-05-28 13:38:56.082896,TeraTork7,Freedom,"This game is slow, fast, boring, exhilarating, easy, complicated, simple and frustrating. I give a lot of kudos to the developers because they put so much into this game but they could put in tons more. The freedom this thing gives you is like no  other game I've found in VR. What I love about this game is you can be going along thinking this is easy and you're kicking butt and taking names and you're hot stuff, then you Teleport over on a mission and suddenly you learn you ain't as tough as you thought you were toughguy!! There is no way the tutorial could ever prepare you for what this game is about because you have full reign to test different stuff. The developers did an awesome job, but I can see where they should have come out with updates that could have new things happen for those of us who learned this thing inside and out and made things happen that we would never expect. The difference between this and a Lone Echo is Lone Echo is graphically phenomenal, but really no freedom as you're led the whole game. From Other Suns allows you to get creative and try different things. Like after defeating the alien mother ship with my sister, I had her chase me while trying to kill me with the guardian and I wasn't allowed to shoot back, but I had 7 stem packs to use while trying to evade her. Do you have any idea how hard we laughed? This game gives you that freedom to do stuff like that and that is just one if a 100 things it allows you to do. Could it be better? Heck yes!!! But they did a good job with it and it requires intelligent people to play. If you're stupid, it ain't for you and don't waste your money or your time because you'll never understand it.

It's awesome boarding other ships with real players, hide behind cover and shoot the enemy. Moreover, you can do more than just shooting (hack stuff, disable the enemy's ship sub systems etc.)! 
However, there are quite 2 game breaking issues:
1) the game tends to freeze up somewhat once in a while with a black screen, forcing you to quit the game. Not sure if that's just me.
2) if the host/captain dies the game is over which kicks out EVERYone in your session (a design flaw in my opinion). That's really bad because often you did not get a chance to add people as friends. Even worse, players can't even tell who the host of the game is if you quick joined. Please change it so that the session keeps the connected players and simply restarts the gameplay.

Also, adding even more game features over time would be nice. I'm really glad it's not limited to shooting but this game shows how much more you can do in VR.","Oct 2, 2019 at 5:31 PM",3, 12,

2022-05-28 13:39:02.436627,Javelin396,Best VR co-op I've played hands down,"This is the kind of game that will have people  anguishing over failures and cheering over triumphs. It takes some experimenting and teamwork to figure how how best to progress and it really feels like your on this epic VR space adventure. This game has issues, such as the connectivity bugs that plague it ( you may want to consider adding players you meet to your oculus friends to stay in games in case you get disconnected), but once you really get games going and meet other players and work together to progress, theres no feeling quite like it.  This game is easily worth wading through the problems working against it, for players that arent afraid of the challenge this game presents. I feel the need to say to people who have tried this game and felt lthat THERE IS A PROGRESSION SYSTEM EVEN IF YOU FAIL. I do think that not making the achievement unlock progression system more apparent was a mistake, as it feels like a failed game really can feel like a waste of time until you find out that your achievements unlock better weapons/ships to start out with with each new playthrough. That said, this is a solid VR experience for anyone who enjoys a bit of a challenge, teamwork, and the sci fi setting for this gem of a game.

2022-05-28 13:39:02.467544,JoshuaBlade,Amazing Game With Only 2 Flaws:,"1. THE GAME DOESN'T SAVE YOUR PROGRESS WHEN YOU DIE AND YOU GOTTA START ALL OVER AGAIN!

Seriously...WHAT THE F**K?! Considering how much you have to do to get to Earth and how long it takes as well as all the loot you can get, this game NEEDS autosaving when you arrive at EVERY system, planet, station, WHATEVER! And if you, the devs, were going to have this f**king annoying game mechanic in place, then why the hell does the game have 3 save slots?!

2. THE GLITCHES!

Baddies more or less glitch all the time into walls, outside the ships, stations, etc. so that MUST be fixed cause I'm tired losing out on HUGE rewards when there's that one little bug, robot, or whatever stuck behind a wall I can't get even with a 'nade!

Sigh...look...I've uninstalled the game so until you devs either make a setting that allows for a player to switch or choose their game to be in Hardcore Mode (you die, you start over) and Normal Mode (Autosaving with every arrival to a system) I'm done with this game which is a pity but I don't wanna have to CONSTANTLY EXIT MY SESSION WITH EVERY F**KING SYSTEM I ARRIVE AT ONLY TO LOAD BACK IN!

2022-05-28 13:39:11.891185,booneytown,Awesome game but needs work from devs,"To start off, this game is great. An entire galaxy you can explore for hours packed with exciting missions, space fights, and fun interactions such as trading with other ships or starting a full-on heist on an innocent traveler's ship. There are lots of different weapons to try and spaceships to take control of. This game is the right difficulty, difficult but not impossible. 

The bad part: This game has lots of bugs that the devs neglected to fix. 
In my experience I have encountered: 
1) Weapons dissapearing 
2) Being randomely kicked from a game
3) Bosses not working properly (In my case the main boss of the entire game would not move.)
4) Quests not initiating or working.
5) Even more I'm yet to discover!

One thing that I wish I knew when I started the game was that when you run out of crew members you have to restart the game (this can be frusturating if you have played for hours.) When you die you take control of a crew member on your ship. Crew can also be killed by pirate attacks, alien attacks, you, etc.

In conclusion: I would reccomend this game to anybody who has VR, just beware of bugs. Also, this game is most fun when played with other people for sure.","May 9, 2019 at 2:43 AM",4, 6,

I started a new playthrough and accidentally left it open for anyone to join, so a couple of other players appeared about 10 minutes into my first ever playthrough. They were really friendly and helpful, despite me being a complete n00b.

The gameplay is solid, especially the shooting and (smooth) movement, which is the main part of the game. There's a good variety of weapons and more or less everything has a good feel to it. Physically taking cover and popping out to fire shots at enemies is so enjoyable.

The sections of the game you spend on your ship are relatively basic but still pretty fun. 

My only gripe with the game is that the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly and dramatically, and it's really difficult to complete a playthrough in single player - you absolutely need the support of other players to stand a chance.","Apr 26, 2019 at 9:07 AM",4, 1,

You have almost no direction. You are constantly struggling to find supplies. Some enemies are so difficult they might as well be immortal and others would fall over in a stiff breeze. You have no way of knowing which type you are about to engage with until they 1 shot you. The game also does not save. If you die, its game over and you have to completely start over from scratch.

I remember when Star Trek Bridge Crew first came out I was so excited.  Being a life long Trekkie the thought of being able to live in the trek world in VR was a dream come true.  It was a fantastic game and a super fun experience playing with other trekkies but it seemed like they missed so much opportunity.  Why couldn't we roam the ship, or fight off invaders, or teleport to other ships or,. get up from our seats at least??  After a couple times of playing it I just didn't feel like it anymore.   

Enter From Other Suns.  EVERYTHING I wanted to do in bridge crew.   It was so fun being able to run to areas of your ship and fix things if the needed repair and your crew mates were busy fixing other things.  The interface was way more fun to operate.  Especially for the engineering part.  Being able to teleport to other ships and battle the inhabitants and loot their cargo holds was a blast!  And then, to my surprise, I started hearing people talking,. and then actually responding to me, and the next thing I knew I had a crew!  If there is one thing I usually stray away from it's multiplayer on line with strangers.  But in the VR communtiy when I have gone out of my comfort zone and done this I have never regretted it.  I was joined by CONTARII and QUATERNIONPIPELINE and holy cow did we have fun.  At least I did. haha!  Everything ran super smooth, and lightning fast.  The gun upgrades, shields, health system,,. just everything is great in this game.

2022-05-28 13:39:18.254843,Imnuktam,Grab a buddy,"Really enjoy this game but it is extremely unforgiving. There is no save, no reloading. If you die, you respawn as one of the other 2 crew members until you run out and start over. If your ship is destroyed or runs out of fuel, you start over. Any mistake and you start over.

The game has great weapons, scenery and ship mechanics. The missions i found enjoyable though they can get repetitive. Hacking can be frustrating as there is no way to buy or make hack tools. Its random % chance you succeed and failure breaks it. If you have 0, probably start over if its early.  

Its a tough game solo. On an away missions you will run the risk of having problems on your ship that arent dealt with properly while you are gone unless you play with other people. 

 Made it to earth one time. They gave me 10 fuel, told me I was earths last hope, and then attacked and destroyed my ship because i hacked their command door to see their bridge and look for a collectible. 

Few things I would like to see

A difficulty setting where Easy lets you reload, normal is what it plays at now and hard for sadists. 

More ships to start with (unlocking is a loooong grind,  I still have 0) Some with more crew for playing with 3 buddies would be nice. 

Let players take other ships after clearing them and hacking everything. Hate leaving a ship with twice the everything to head back to my noob ship. 

Let players craft or buy weapons/hackers. I teleport over to every trade ship i come across to take theirs in tp bay, but eventually if you have a bad fight or no fights for a few jumps you can be left with too weak of a weapon collection to have much success at away missions. 

All in all , it is a great experience. If you are a star trek fan this felt so much more like star trek than Star trek did lol. The weapons were some of my fav in vr and its definitely worth getting.","Apr 6, 2020 at 11:45 AM",5, 24,

Let's take Skyrim VR or Fallout 4 VR they are amazing games to play in VR but no multiplayer.  To be able to play either of those big experiences in co-op would be amazing.  How about Borderlands 2 VR, it's an amazing open world game but they removed the co-op from it, still a great game but come on.

From Other Suns has lots of hours of play, unlockables, weapon rarity, bosses and other enemies can drop common/rare/epic weapons and items, u know the things that makes games fun.

The game also incorporates parts of FTL (u know one of the most amazing games ever made) and Borderlands co-op style gameplay.  It also has roguelite gameplay (if u die u start over), but u can unlock stuff to make ur next run easier and provides a challenge, even with experienced players ur still not guaranteed to finish a run.

What makes it special is the fact that after every ""mission"", the strategic aspect becomes increasingly important. You must choose the right weapons and use them with intelligence, choose the right equipment for your ship, plan your strategies according to the different missions.

2022-05-28 13:39:24.606611,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Good but could have been the best.,"This game seems needlessly cruel. 

You'd work hard to make several upgrades to your ship and a random attack, could end all your hard work. ""Well that is how the game is supposed to be-"" perhaps, but I don't feel like playing again for a long time after my shiny balloon has been popped. Fruitless grinding is no fun. 

Speaking of fun- the game is fun, especially with friends. It's immense fun, working together as a team, going on away missions. Then it all comes to a stop with no payoff, no climax, no resolution. It's hard to get people together to play VR. To get them all to buy the same game (or even try a free weekend) and the odds of getting together again and playing the same game multiple times is slim. So- I'm sure this game is mostly played solo. Which is lonely and hard. And half the fun.

I feel like this game could be im improved by allowing the player to continue from the last ""jump"" point after death. I know, it's against the spirit of the game- ""it's supposed to be difficult dummy!"" Perhaps have an easy mode, and make the way it is now 'difficult mode.' For people who beat the game in 'difficult mode' they could give out a ""You're Better Than Those Easy Mode Losers"" achievement to make it worthwhile. 

Besides the difficulty, there seems to be many pieces that could use some polish. Emphasize some aspects while de-emphasizing others. I feel like there is no hook to keep my interests. No reward system. From Other Suns hasn't been updated since it was released. It's worth mentioning. This is what it is ever going to be. I find that sad because one of the best all time VR games is 90% percent there.

Edit: Some people in their reviews have said, resetting makes the game fun. I would agree if deaths were due to something the player actually did, ""oh I should've done this instead""- but as it is now an OP pirate appearing and saying ""I feel like killing you."" and then doing it is UNFAIR. Time invested in a single play could be 8 hours-- all lost.","Dec 2, 2018 at 5:06 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 13:39:27.699483,JackDiddley,"Was Hoping For More, But Still Good","First off my initial impression for this game was not great.  I had it on my list for a while based on the description, then it came up on a free play weekend.

My first three play throughs left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  My hopes were for a RPG style game with customization, freedom to roam, and some skill building.  So this is not like that.  This game revolves around building up weapons through random missions while you are jumping system to system trying to get to Earth.  The whole time aliens are getting closer and closer.  You have to keep moving away from the wave of aliens, while managing your fuel, ship ammunition, and crue members. 
If you run out of fuel you can't make anymore jumps to get to Earth, if you run out of ship ammo an enemy will destroy you.  IF you die and there isn't a crue member to spawn to, you stay dead, game over... no savepoint, all progress, and weapons lost.
That's what I didn't like about it.  I would get killed only having found a couple of guns, low on money, and I even ran out of fuel once.
I spent about 6-8 hours playing before I got the hang of it, and when I did I really learned to love this game for what it is.  
The action is sweet, I like moving like a real person, and ducking around corners for a fire fight. I finally got the hang of it, and by applying a simple principal - ROB EVERYBODY - I now have a wall full of guns, lots of fuel, and althought I was down to zero crew at one point , I now have two plus me.  Hoping to get to Earth as I understand it unlocks stuff for your next play through.

I'd still like to be able to upgrade, at least health and inventory slots (5 guns and 5 other stuff, not enough) and if someone took this style and turned it into a full RPG, I'd be in.  I wound up buying the game, and I'm here to tell you... if you get a chance to play this game before buying it, give it a good long test play, keep playing, dying, and starting over.  Eventually you'll get the hang of it.","Nov 12, 2018 at 6:29 AM",4, 19,

2022-05-28 13:39:27.732395,FalkH,"Good intentions, but no progress","This game has what it takes to be great. Unfortunately the current execution is not perfect for everyone and the game seems abandoned after one year of developers inactivity.
My biggest issue is the perfomance. My rig is an AMD FX8350/GTX1060, not even enough to run a stable 45fps. Since walking locomotion fits best the game style, motion sickness is incoming.
Changing settings don't change a lot, it's odd to see pixel graphics but still dropping below 45fps at the worst moments in every fight. Something went really south here.
Another issue (if you plan to play many hours) is the content. The storyline contains to many repetitive elements, some variation would really improve the game and there are so many options to bring variety to this game.
It's a shame that the devs let it down completly without even opening a gap for modding. Maybe they are to busy making a successor, I hope.
EDIT: Just dropped another star for another year of developer inactivity. UE 4.16 got many updates since they released the game. To bad we stuck with these lazy devs.","Jul 15, 2019 at 8:32 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 13:39:27.749350,Huth_S0lo,Hoping things improve,"I played the free weekend.  Since its selling for half price, I went ahead and purchased it.  The game seems like it has the potential to be the best VR game out there.  But there is a ton of shortcomings.  I played last night and collected some great weapons. I joined this morning and it put me in a different toon with no guns.  I made a single jump, and my ship was boarded.  There I was with no weapons and it was all over.  Kind of stupid.  Just now I played.  I found a ship that was full of pirates.  I hopped on.  Killed a bunch of NPC's, and found some great loot.  However, I had no way to teleport back to my ship.  The I was on had its power online, but no systems were powered.  After an hour of looking around for a way to online the systems, I realized I was unable to get back and had to end the game.

Again, it seems like it can be one of the best games ever, so I went ahead and purchased it.  But I do hope the Dev's improve on some of the gaps in gameplay.","Nov 12, 2018 at 2:30 AM",3, 4,

But the game does have a lot of bugs and difficulty goes 0-100 out of nowhere. One jump and you can find yourself getting blown up by a pirate in one shot. I think it's basically mandatory to complete achievements over multiple plays in order to get unlocks to start with to get to the end.

It can be grindy at times, and the enemies bullet spongey, however, the co-op mechanics are sufficent to overcome such shortcomings. This is one of the only games I find my self regularly returning to in VR (along side Echo VR and Rec Room).

Another criticism I'd level at this game, is that it has a lot more content than it might let on, and many players may spend countless hours without ever even knowing they are there.

I would suggest that the developers do more to guide the players towards such content (you're basically thrown into the deep end and expected to discover the mechanics of the game as you go), but it would seem the developers have moved on to other projects. The game has been basically abandoned and written off as completed, so don't expect to see any of the flaws being addressed in the future.

All that said a solid execution of what this game set out to do, makes this a title worth playing. In particular, with friends.","Oct 30, 2018 at 10:54 AM",4, 17,

Especially at early levels or when playing solo. My suggestion is to add an option (like a checkbox at the start) to treat the game as if there are always 3 people in it. As of right now, I usually have to limit myself to things like not using the medbay (only health kits), only using weak weapons (pistols, shotguns), and not crouching behind cover to keep the game challenging. 

The last mission should also be a lot harder. In my opinion, you should fail about 90% of the time attempting it. Right now the most difficult part about it is intercepting the enemy ship by predicting where it will jump.","Sep 25, 2018 at 10:02 PM",5, 2,

Aiming:  Very strange.  There are no crossairs or iron sights or scopes.  Aiming is a guessing game and ususally you have to fire a shot somewhere near your target to figure out the gun.
Empty World:  There is nothing to grab besides items that you can use.  There is a lot of clutter in some of the environments but you can not interact with them.  I am so used to being able to interact with the world in VR so it makes me sad when I can not pick up a coffee mug or move some boxes away.
Repetitive:  Now, this isn't a bad thing for me because I don't mind it.  Just putting it out there that people were not lying about that.  

However, I have not played it with others, so maybe it is a lot more fun and can help me forget about the things I listed.  It's a fun space game where you play as the crew and get to shoot laser guns at space pirates and aliens.  Get into tactical space fights and try to make it to the other end of space before an alien invasion does.

2022-05-28 13:39:49.871608,Duhya,Good concept,"But feels empty, and the guns/enemies (which 90% of the gameplay revolves around) don't feel very responsive.

 The weapons have to be aimed from instinct/the last shot because there is no form of sights. The weapon sounds don't have much oomph making them feel like toys.

The enemies are bullet sponges with no indication of how much health they have, or how much damage you're doing. It's not fun shooting someone for a minute straight while they give off the same hit reaction a thosuand times.

Apparently you can shake the guns to speed up the reload/overheat thing that happens, but this is awkward, and if it works I can't tell the difference. I would've much preferred some sort of reload that you actively do. Changing a battery maybe. 

The levels(ships) are kind of empty and boring, and there's nothing interactive in them. On that note there's not much in the ship to do with the crew. There's a tape player in the captains lounge, but it would've been nice to have interactables to play around with. Something to provide downtime between the shooting bits.

2022-05-28 13:39:49.910505,joehendrey,Great fun. Needs more content,"For those that aren't familiar with the rogue-like genre, the whole idea is that you play until you die, and then you restart from the beginning. I've found a single run goes for around an hour which feels about right for a play session. I've yet to actually finish the game, so a complete run would obviously be a bit longer. Luckily, you can always save part-way through and come back to it if needed (although no re-loading a save if you die).

The game involves hopping from system to system across the galaxy in your spaceship, encountering other spaceships and space stations along the way, and completing various missions. Mostly you will be teleporting over to other ships and shooting everything in sight, but you can also choose to fire on the other ship, or simply power up your warp drive and jump away. This core gameplay is really fun and provides a great mix of exploration, action, and quick tactical decision making.

I've played about equal parts single and multiplayer and have had fun with both. I have only played online with friends however, so I can't comment on what the community is like in general. I will say that you will have a much harder time single player because the friendly AI is practically useless and you have very limited control over what your crew members do.

The production quality of the game is mostly top-notch. The voice acting is well done, the music has some cool moments (One of the themes is similar to the Avengers theme which is a bit cheeky, but it's cool so I'm not complaining), the visual design is excellent with ship environments that I just really enjoy exploring. Unfortunately the environments, though pretty, are almost completely non-interactive. There are handles that can't be grabbed and objects that can't be picked up all over the place. This approach to set-dressing just doesn't really work in VR. If it looks like you can grab it, you should be able to grab it. The other downer is that it is a bit buggy.","Apr 15, 2018 at 2:16 PM",4, 7,

Combined with missed opportunities of really fleshing the gameplay out (e.g. stealing other ships) and smoothing the VR experience out. Why is there still a giant icon in your face during jumps? Why can't we ban trolls? Why can't we have a server/game list to choose from instead of being forced to join a random game? Why is there no way to stay with your teammates after the game ends so you can start another game together? Why why why? The game still sells well, it seems, so why stop supporting it? It's difficult to rate this above a 3 in its current state. I wish I could give it 5 stars because that's what it used to feel like.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AND SEE THAT THERE IS NO CONTENT IN THIS GAME. THIS IS STUPID AND GARBAGE.

THE MULTIPLAYER IS BROKEN, BECAUSE WHEN YOU JOIN MULTIPLAYER ALL PROGRESS YOU MAKE WILL BE LOST.
BTW, THERE IS NO PROGRESS TO BE MADE IN THIS GAME. THE AI IS RETARDED AND THERE IS NOTHING TO DO IN THIS GAME, besides choosing the next destination which will have another ship to board.

STUPID GAME!!!!


UPDATE: I REQUESTED A REFUND WHEN MY GAME SAID 2 HOURS PLAY TIME, YET RIFT DENIES ME MY REDUND!!!! WHAT SHADY BUSINESS!!!!!!! I HATE THIS GAME- I HATE SEEING IT IN MY LIBRARY- I HATE HOW I GOT ROBBED!!!! - I HATE HOW I KEEP THINKING ABOUT THIS GAME-

It has a space (your ship) that you call home, defend and protect.  You travel the galaxy with your crew and fight pirates and aliens and negotiate with traders.

My first  impression was that this game was meant to be played with others and would be very difficult single player. That impression is very inaccurate. What the game doesn't tell you is that even though you start over when you die, you are making progress towards achievements, which unlock permanent weapons and upgrades such as new ships. So the more you play, the more powerfull you are at the start of th e next game. 

In addition to this permament upgrade system, my favorite aspect of the game is the ship combat. I love exploring every nook and cranny of each ship in the hopes that I find a cool weapon or statue that I can bring back to my ship. In addition, this is definitely one of the longer experiences I've had in VR. I've probalby put in well over 20 hours and am still hooked. In addition I still have  many achivements that I have yet to unlock. I can easily see myself playing this for quite some time or at least until I have unlocked every ship and possible upgrade.","Mar 29, 2018 at 9:03 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:39:59.409463,nulshift,Great game with a weak finish,"The game is really fun. Shooting bad guys, robots, and other creepy things. The stress of dying and having it all end always looming over you, even more intensely as you lose more crew members. The guns feel really nice to use, aside from the disc weapons. The visuals are great aside from a few animation problems. The soundtrack is very nice. And all that alone is the reason it gets a 4 star rating. My problems come down to the ship battles and the end of the game. All ship battles play the same. Knock out their shield or tactical depending on your weapon setup, and then kill them, that is, if you don't just board them and kill them from the inside. Which is easier and more rewarding anyway. And the last mission... I don't get why you go from dying in 3 hits throughout the game to being practically invincible at the end. It feels like we prepared everything and invested so much when we could've ran in with the 104 damage pistols and no healing and still do fine. Even with that disappointing end though, the rest of the game was still fun enough that I didn't have any regrets buying or experiencing this game.","Mar 1, 2018 at 4:24 AM",4, 5,

It is easy to navigate and easy to use, however it is not easy to manage all during single player. I don't look at walkthroughs because I enjoy figuring thing out on my own. That being said, I have not yet finished the game. The level of difficulty that seems to bump up without warning is harsh. Also, I tried different upgrades for my ship but non seem to give me the right path. So while I go through gameplay now it has gotten less fun for me over time. Crew member AI is garbage sometimes, but it is better than being alone. Overall I love the gameplay mechanics and the feeling of being my own boss in space.

2022-05-28 13:40:02.573129,KingGelbin,Great game with great replay value.,"I will keep this short and simple. FOS is a good game among a slew of horrible games for the Oculus rift. Fighting space pirates and rogue bots can keep you on your toes. Trying to stay ahead of a alien invasion force so you can make it back to earth before they consume you in route. 

Your game gets ""auto saved"" as you play but once your last crew member dies you cannot re-load your old game and pick up from your last save point.

In multiplayer your more then likely to be teamed up with obnoxious trolls who only look to ruin your game experience rather then coming together to work as a team and win the game. If you insist on going solo then you will find it very difficult to conquer this game. Best to utilize your friend list and play with your other adult friends rather then being randomly matched with immature trolls who insist on standing in front of you trying to squeeze the boobs of the female crew member you might be occupying for the game.

2022-05-28 13:40:08.914950,RobinBot,Extremely good with serious faults,"First and foremost, doing anything but boarding an enemy ship is the wrong decision 100% of the time. Every slug-fest you get into with your ship's weapon is a garunteed uphill battle that you will almost always lose, and will never profit from. Scrap rewards for non-boarding actions are always less than the repair costs, and spending scrap on repairs will create a massive setback. It is, even with good purpose-built weapons, extremely difficult to disable systems from your ship. While boarding, destroying systems is as easy as poking around a corner and tossing a few bullets into it.

In terms of gunplay it's alright. The shake-controller-to-reload method is decent, but I cannot help but wonder why it could not be done by pressing the analog stick. In an intense firefight it's annoying to have to wildly flail your arms around in the hope that it realzies what you want, resetting your aim and forcing you to retreat. Boarding actions are, in the first 50% of the game, fun and engaging.

HOWEVER: Later in the game all enemies get personal shields (that you cannot get) and use cover-ignoring rapid-fire exploding shot weapons. The only option is to do the same yourself, and 9/10 times the best plan is to find corners the AI has to run around and shoot them as they walk stupidly around the corner before retreating and repeating. All fun is sucked out of the gunplay at this point as Cover is irrelevant, fighting is by ambush only, and if you have other players with you clustering together is garunteed death.

The Hack-a-tron system (Where you plug in a disposable item into a computer and wait for a dice roll) is infuriatingly simple and boring, relying on rare drops to unlock Cargo containers which become your main source of income. Cargo systems often have higher hacking levels than any hack-a-trons you have access to, which 100% garuntees you will not be able to unlock it. There is no way around.

Simple fixes could bring this from a cheap FTL clone into a great game.","Feb 7, 2018 at 4:40 AM",3, 12,

What I didn't realize was that it's basically RNG for any ""jump"" for objectives while on a countdown timer. Because everyone loves countdown timers. Oh, and by the way, if you die and you're the last crew member, all progress is lost. You have to start from scratch again. No way to backup any equipment you found, and no way of knowing if the next jump is going to pit you against some boss level pirate ship that'll obliterate your ship in a matter of minutes. But hey you can start over and try again like any Rogue-like game (FTL I hear is similar but I've never played it). Not a personal fan of those, I like challenge, but can't stand RNG where it isn't checked. Dark Souls > Darkest Dungeons for me.

No where in the trailer or ""tutorial"" or gameplay made me aware of these game design elements, so I purchased it when it went on sale. Now I'm stuck with my purchase since for whatever reason, Oculus denied my refund request.

The setting is sort of like a 1990's SCI-FI show, with the basic premise that you start on one side of the universe and need to make it to Earth before an alien fleet arrives.  On the way you'll find Pirates, Traders, Stations, Aliens and the like.

One warning is that this is very Rouge like - Your ship has limited crewmembers and everytime you die, you end up taking over one of the crew members and after the last crew member dies, that's it.. Game over which can be frusturating when you are so very close to getting home or have hours in on the match.         with that said, you end up getting perks for the achievements you make (how many pirates you kill, robots, aliens and ships you destroy) which includes better guns, different ships and the like.

Even if this game is a good one in solo mode, its best is in multiplayer and i can't stand not being able to play it that way especially when it was possible since few days ago.

Devs should work on this problem by finding a solution cause its not acceptable having connection problems on a game that relies so much on multiplay experience.
The reason for wich i'm sure is a 'game' problem and not 'my connection' problem is that every other online game i have keeps working fine with no exceptions.
So if it's a problem that just in theese days sprung up, please see if you can sort it out because it's devastating the overall game experience.
thank you for your reading.
 I keep the rest of the review cause it's still correct.
I will surely remove this update as soon as the problem is sort out.

the game itself is great to be played even in single player and is a great challenge thats lasts hors of gameplay.

2022-05-28 13:40:21.504695,ItzPiggles,Bought it after the 2 day trial,"i loved this game upon first play, it was a mix of commanding a ship and a fps, then when i found out once you lost your ship your save was wiped and i thought differently. Then i had 1 more go, i learnt about the guns, the reloading, the way the game end worked, then i loved it. this lead to me playing it for 7 hours straight (till 1 am in the morning) I came back the next day and rushed on it, despite the fact i only had 30 minutes and despite earlier saying it wasn't worth £30, i bought it as i couldn't think about not being able to see the end to this game, and the endless possibilites of fun it holds.

The best part about this game is the community, everyone has a joke with you and are really into the game, even though it was the free weekend, this along with other reasons is why i bought this highly addicting game!

The only thing is: if you are a casual gamer i do not reccommend this as it is quite a hardcore gaming experience but other then that, buy this game!!!","Jan 22, 2018 at 5:28 AM",5, 10,

It freezes my computer up, I can't do anything in my Oculus, its all black, even Ctrl+Alt+Del doesn't work! I have to turn my computer off by the power button and turn it back on. It gives my computer a chance to mess up by scattering game short cuts in random places and other things. Its probably just my graphics card, but could someone please help?

2022-05-28 13:40:24.660892,BeastyBaiter,Excellent,"A truly excellent VR COOP shooter. With VR games, we often have to state it's ""good... for VR"" since so many games are really not all that good. This one is just awesome though. Whether played solo, with friends or with random strangers, it's an absolute blast. Tons of replay value too since every play through is different. This is a hard game though, make no mistake about it. It starts out simple but the difficulty increases dramatically the further in you go.

All that said, the netcode needs some work. The combat side seems almost flawless but interacting with dropped items and weapon racks is a bit glitchy at times. I've also seen a few infinite loading screens requiring a good old alt+crtl+delete when trying to connect with another player. I don't think these two issues take away too much from the game, hence the 5 star rating still, but they do need to be fixed.","Jan 27, 2018 at 5:25 AM",5, 5,

Its so much fun to board pirate ships, kill everyone on board and steal their cargo. Or clean space stations, complete missions there and fight bosses. The random elements take care of that no run is like the previous one. And with every run, even failed ones, you'll get better and better. What this game needs is more content: more different missions, more bosses, more enviroments. After the fantastic Chronos this is another great game by Gunfire Games.

2022-05-28 13:40:24.734694,jjGuardian,"Good game play, BUT...","Firslty, the game plays and flows well.

Your in a ship with level 0 components that all need upgrading. You have to collect recources to upgrade.
Your being chased by an alien race that massively overpowers you and they capture every system if they bypass you.
You have next to no fuel so you need to scrounge as you go.
The enemy on board the other ships gets harder as you get closer to earth. By 40% the way to Earth its extremely tough.
The enemy crew uses sight and sound mechanics and there is no way to kill silently so, shoot one and you get everyone from nearby rooms.

You have 3 lives, die and you get to start all over again from scratch.

The game auto saves your exact situation constantly so there is no save game to reload, mess up and there goes a life.

Around 40% the way to earth the pirates & bots on ships get missles and can 2 shot you so the one or two stim packs you can carry are worthless and you need to keep beaming back to your own ship for heals.

Multiplayer is out of control. I accidentally launched into multiplayer with my personal mission ship. My weapons where cleaned out by players and they flew us into the destruction of my ship, all in the span of 5 minutes. So I had to start from scratch.
If you get a nice group of fellas, the multiplayer can be fun but even with three of us, the enemy became too much at around 40% the way to Earth

But the game play is nice.


The game appears bugged in some areas where enemy crew spawn endlessly, usually in spots where there are half a dozen comming at you at once. The only solution I found was to beam back to your ship and return. Getting killed works too. --- Finally made it to earth. No acheivment for it and when I headed back out to fight the aliens, I died 1 jump away. It told me I was 98% the way to earth..DOH after I had already got there. Getting to earth is sheer luck btw!","Nov 17, 2017 at 3:48 PM",3, 37,

Me and my buddy have tried multiple times to progress further than 40% but just end up getting killed eventually.  And, once, a bot glitched into the walls and ended up shooting all of us through the walls! (we couldnt shoot back). I also feel like the game goes from easy to really difficult real fast, without any form of warning. And lastly: I find the weapons to be rather dull. They are like kids toys if you compare them to a game like Artika.1 (where they are awesome!).

Other than that, I really had fun playing this in co-op! Had some great laughs. But I'm done for now, unless there will be some update that improve upon what I've mentioned above.","Jan 29, 2018 at 1:17 AM",3, 2,

If all you are wanting from the game is to simply complete it and move on then you will miss out on what this game truly has to offer. 

From Other Suns has alot of replayability with its cool but really rather short story, and its story is also rather simplistic. You will however, find yourself more than likely coming back time after time trying to snag the trophies and other achievements that can net you cool in-game rewards like new ships and sweet guns. The ability to have the adventure with up to 2 other pals for me is one of the best things about the game, as there is a vast number of great moments to be had with other people. The developers and the community are available through discord with LFG topics as well as the option to leave feedback and read about the updates to the game.

Overall this has been one of my favourite titles for VR and has given me many hours of fun and is one game i would happily recommend for anyone who is looking for a great game to enjoy.","Jan 25, 2018 at 10:02 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 13:40:27.898327,dugthefreshest,Game Crash fixed. Game is OK.,"The developers have fixed the crash in the beginning of the game, in the course of a day, which is amazing.  So'I'm updating the review.

Updating my review from Good (4), to OK (3).  There just isnt enough variety AT ALL.  Ship to Ship combat is a chore, and you will fight the same enemies, over, and over, and over again. Everyone in the galaxy seems to have the same 3 issues, a rogue AI, pirates, or corrupted robot guards.   These are primarily the only three things you will see throughout your journey to earth.

So far, the game is OK.  Just good, not great, but really OK.  Playing just about any VR game coop with a friend always makes it better, and that is primarily what I have been doing.  

The visuals are great, shooting is great, but so far we have only encountered 1 type of ""boss"" after helping/raiding many stations.  I know this game is roguelike so we may see many new things later, but as of now, we've played for a few hours and nothing has changed much from the first mission.

I do like finding new weapons and stuff, BIG kudos to the shield.  It's awesome.  

So the way I see things is 1 Star unplayable, 2 stars sucks, 3 stars could skip it, 4 stars good, 5 stars great.  

This is OK, Enjoyable, and enjoyable with a friend. Try it out.","Jan 12, 2018 at 1:04 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 13:40:30.991665,soulfiremage,Permadeath caught me out! Beware,"It plays slow and long, no problem with that. You pick stuff up, visit stations, kill a few things. It's not a quick wham bam game and it's pretty solid. Do wish I could jump and/or speed up the free movement but that's very minor.

My big beef that will stop me putting much more time into it now is permadeath. In other words, if you die three times, you lose all progress.

Maybe I expect something different but if I'm going to play a slower style of shooter like this that mixes a little trade, a little exploration, then surely I could keep my progress on single player?

Wouldn't be fair to knock more stars off as it's pretty decent in every other respect. I doubt I'll be playing much more as I don't have the patience to restart from scratch on a slow burn shooter.","Dec 26, 2017 at 9:20 PM",4, 4,

It seems that the performance of the gpu or system is not the issue but the vram that is filling up quite soon after the game launches.
At the moment game is only playable with all the settings put to low, and multisampling to whopping 0.5.
I really hope that this game would get a patch that would easy up the requirements for the GPU vram, cause buying a new GPU right now is not an option (there arent any decent GPUs anywhere!!)

For the game itself: this is FTL pure and simple. But it goes so much deeper, when you actually ocupy the space. Hard decicions that will come to haunt you. This game does tough love well :)","Jan 26, 2018 at 3:33 PM",3, 0,

Several random encounter boss fights, lots of weapon variety, challenging gameplay, and multiplayer co-op make this a must-have title for hardcore VR players. 

[Semi-spoilers ahead]

Again, this game is CHALLENGING once you get past 60-70% into a playthrough. You gotta stay on top of exploring areas while you can and finding better weapons as you go. Final boss was slightly disappointingly easy, but was kind of a relief after surviving the onslaught of pirates and alien ships leading up to the final fight.

I've probably spent hours already, with waiting for connections and getting disconnects from games and so on. (And no, my bandwith is not limited, as there are games that ran like a charm. ;) )

The second bad thing is the difficulty spike. Some bosses or enemies can be overwhelming, right after you had no trouble in the last fight. Which is irritating. Especially when there is permadeath involved.

But all in all, i can clearly say, this game is amazing. Even though it's a shame there won't be coming content updates, not sure but it doesn't look that way.

If you’ve played FTL you’ll recognise the overall premise; make your way back to Earth (on the east of the map) while being pursued by aliens from the west.  Each jump consumes one fuel and may or may not lead to an away mission, a chance to resupply or upgrade.  The closer you get to Earth the more difficult the missions become. 

You start with three crew which represent your lives but can pick up more as you go.  If all your crew are kill, or your ship destroyed its game over.  But progression comes from an achievement system which allows you to unlock legendary starting weapons and more ships.


There are a number of locomotion settings.  After trying comfort I switched to full movement which I found very comfortable with no nausea despite the fast pace and playing for hours at a time.  Both standing and seated also work fine.","Dec 31, 2017 at 10:32 PM",5, 8,

On the plus side it really feels alot like FTL in 3D and the multiplayer is good fun.","Jan 5, 2018 at 11:28 PM",3, 1,

Got a lot of potential here I wish they add more smarts to the game mechanics and missing melee (think robo recall), please add melee or allow me to smah enemies in the head with my weapon! Would be nice to see a skill tree or something similar to add to my abilities. Would like to be able to interact with more objects in the game, so many times I reach for items or things and can't interact. Easily spent a few hours playing this on first load. First time playing made it to 3%, was boarded by aliens and lost my ship/crew and it was all over. Ability to load from saved point even after dying would be nice additon but I can see why it's not the case with the whole FTL concept any all, I guess I'm thinking and hoping for more of an Open world / RPG type gameplay when playing solo :)

Basically, not being chased down but freely exploring the universe and difficulty increases as one gets closer to specific territories. Get to keep my ship, trophies, crew and weapons would be great for single player mode, also if I can bring my NPC crew as I board ships.

If I get the features I mentioned then an easy 5 stars from me.","Jan 15, 2018 at 11:29 AM",4, 2,

Today, 1/5/18, over three sessions, we had a full game crash during a jump, and one of us lost all our wepons upon reload.  The tactical station ""hologram"" frequently would not generate text or icons, meaning only the captain can access tactical, as well as other small visual glitches.

As far as content, it is almost entirely a thematic copy of ""FTL,"" but it has less compelling story elements (everyone you meet is either a pirate or trader, or a station with pirates or traders) and weaker ship-based gameplay (fewer systems, less galaxy exploration, weird difficulty spikes) though it of course adds VR and FPS which are quite fun.  

There isn't a lot of ship or character variation, though the VOs are good and the character models are as well.  I wish they had animated mouth movement for players like in Star Trek Bridge Crew.

I really want this to be my favorite VR game, but it is trying very hard to ruin the experience.  I love the game while I'm playing it (and it's working), but it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","Jan 6, 2018 at 5:59 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 13:40:56.420612,DeathByDrum,Wow.  This is a fantastic game.,"Heart pounding.  I jumped to a new system on my far-bound travels to Earth in a race against the alien forces nipping at my heels, a pirate was waiting.  So I targeted his weapons, swiftly disabled them and then teleported to their ship and began slowly and methodically exterminating their entire crew while taking out their engines, shields and finally their captain before hacking their cargo manifest and teleporting all their ill-gotten gains to my ship.  As a final goodbye, I teleported back to my ship and blew theirs to bits with a barrage of laser fire from my ship.

...4 jumps later I came across an alien that then ate my entire crew.

Such is life in From Other Suns.

This game is quite frankly amazing.  You get to run around your own ship with your crew repairing systems as pirates dock and try to take over, you do the same to them, you can simply target enemy vessels and blow them to kingdom come and then sell the profits to upgrade your ship, buy new weapons or even more crew-members to keep your ship in top shape (as well as provide you with extra lives when you inevitably die).  Basically, there's a hell of a lot you can do and no game is the same.  Since it's a roguealike, some games you'll be getting punished right from the start and struggle like hell to keep things together - whereas in others, you'll have a bout of luck and find weapons and resources aplenty - but there are no guarantees.

If you want an amazing experience in VR.  Look no further than this game.  Sure, in some ways it's a bit rough around the edges and it'll leave you wanting even more content - but as we're in the early days of VR, this is a fantastic example of what's waiting for us in times to come.

You'll die a lot, but won't be able to help yourself from trying just *one* more time.. or, maybe a few more times.. :) The achievement system is great, it gives you goals to work toward even if you can't ""beat"" the game right away. My only criticisms: 1) While the environment LOOKS fantastic, it's relatively dead and lacks interactivity (even if not necessary for game mechanics, it really enhances immersion when you can play with things & affect the world at least a little bit).. 2) Being able to select/customize your avatar, even at the very LEAST choose M/F/robot etc, it's actually mildly confusing when we all spawn as opposite our real world sex.. and 3) it would be REALLY great to be able play co-op with MORE than just 3 people!!","Dec 28, 2017 at 3:47 AM",5, 1,

Counter intuitive at first, the inventory is ok, even if my first ""take a grenade, activate it, throw it"" was a disaster... you'll get used to it. The multiplayer is awesome, but connexions are too instable and buggy. Hope the last patch fixed it. To be honest, this game is... the real thing. You will find yourself crouched, guns in hands like Ian Solo. You will find yourself running like hell because a f***ing Xenos is chasing you and your unloaded guns (where is this f***ing loader?!). You will prey for your last hackatron to hack a cargo even if it's a 5% chance to work. You will find yourself trying to inject a medkit in you veins under enemies fire, heart pounding hard because it's your last life (and they are wayyy more than you thought). You will sometimes die stupidly, because of overconfidence, and tell yourself you will never do the same reckless mistake. But you also will win, and when you do, well... You will want to restart another adventure. Because each is different. Only one thing : the game can be repetitive, even if it is always fun to play. It could benefit from a little more content/maps/enemy type/weapon type/ missions/boss variety.

Fleeing across the galaxy from a pursuing menace, gathering salvage, fuel and ammunition from anywhere you can to fund upgrades and keep you moving.  Where this game stands apart from FTL is the away-team missions - teleportig into a station or ship and clearing out pirates, rogue robots or aliens.  The gunplay feels good, and you can duck behind cover or around corners to avoid incoming fire.  The enemy AI is mostly effective as well, with enemies moving to flank you if you stay put too long.  Bosses are a bit easier though, with their movements and attacks restricted to a few well telegraphed patterns.  The final boss feels exceptionally easy compared to the endless swarm of bots you'll face in the firmware upload missions.  Still, the game plays well in solo and shines in co-op.

loads of guns. although some more skins for the weapons would make that element more interesting. 

the respawn mechanic is very ZombiU, which  is fine by me but not to everybodies liking. 

the enemies are fairly varied by system rather than within their species. 

unlocks via achievements has always been my preferred method of unlocking since stalker: pripyat. 

Ultimately this is an excellent game with potential to become a system seller if the developer supports and expands it. As is, it's still worthy of buying. but it could be become great in the future.","Dec 6, 2017 at 2:32 PM",4, 2,

It's got near infinite replayability if you like shooting stuff and are fine with limited, but solid, mechanics. The exploration and ship captaining aspects are fairly shallow, and after two days of relentless play I think I've seen most, if not all, of the interaction types. The game doesn't run perfectly by any stretch of the imagination, and even with all the settings turned to minimum on my well over min-spec machine, it still showed some hitches here and there (particularly in the UI). 

But despite the negatives, FOS is one of the few REAL games for VR. Boarding your first pirate ship with only a pistol in your hand, and not the faintest idea what you'll discover is pure magic. Even once the novelty wears off, the shooting mechanics are outright fun and the random environments and weapons keep things much fresher than most other VR games.

Overall, both the FTL style ship combat and the FPS sections are fun and there is decent variety in enemies and the weapons they use, which they seem to have incresed even more since the beta. 

My only complaint would be that the guns seem to have a somewhat underwhelming impact on enemies. Would be nice if enemies would get significantly stunned, knocked back or fall down when taking fire, especially the squishy humans.

2022-05-28 13:41:34.551324,djpeterson83,Amazing but Bare,"Tons of fun when playing with friends or strangers in the universe.  I really love being the captain of my own ship and making decisions for my crew (human or AI).  The experience as a whole is great allowing you to play from a first person perspective while adventuring among the stars.  

PROS: Rogue like design where death is permanent and if you lose all ""meat bags"" on the ship, you lose and it deletes your saved game.  Good FPS mechanics.  Random encounters keep each game fresh and fun.

CONS: Inventory system takes some getting used to; unintuitive at first, but you do get the hang of it after some time.  Encounters tend to get repetetive... until you encounter the Xenos (then you cry like a baby).  Also, earth is in danger from advanced aliens (similar to FTL), so you can't really stick around and just explore a single area, lest the aliens destroy earth.  However, they aren't break-neck fast, so you can do some exploration and have time to make slight detours if you want/need.  So far, there is only one ship you can pilot.  Would be nice if you could capture ships.

Overall, a very fun game, especially with friends and random people online.  It really hits the space-renegade spot we've all been waiting for!  If the developers continue to add features to this game, I think it will be one of the best Rift experiences out there!","Nov 30, 2017 at 1:49 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 13:41:34.570273,beelandj,"Great Coop Game, Room to be Even Better","Solo this game is quite challenging; with one other person it becomes amazingly fun.

The good:
-Good basic game loop
-Many different options for movement
-No issues with multiplayer connectivity observed

The bad:
-Enemy AI is very rudimentary
-Difficulty scaling across a session can be very spiky, particularly when solo
-The variety of missions/encounters is fairly low, so you see the same missions frequently (though the maps are randomly created)
-Minor bugs (items occasionally disappearing when dropped, had a teleporter send me into a bulkhead once until the game was restarted, etc)

Bottom line:
Well worth the price, and I'd personally actually welcome an expansion of the game at a later date with additional missions, weapon types, ships, etc for a moderate fee (say around $10)  The base game is a good platform and the rogue-like generation makes it something which could easily be expanded upon.","Nov 29, 2017 at 12:00 PM",4, 1,

That feeling u get when beaming over to the enemy ship and taking out their crew is beyond words. The only complaint I have is the multiplayer. Right now I only play solo or a private game with a friend. I have tried to host a public game, but every time people join my game they run straight to the tactical terminal in my ship and fire on whatever is infront of us (usually it is a huge station and it gets us killed instantly). It is near impossible to find a group of people that are actually helpful and don't try and troll your save game by getting you killed and wasting hours of work. Some serious work is needed on the multiplayer side of this game. Right now having more people does not make things easier, it just complicates things and is  usually just chaos. I'm afraid to even open my game up to public matchmaking, and that is not how a co-op game should make you feel.

It really comes into it's own in co-op though. I've played this with my brother since release, and having your own ship and working together to upgrade, battle pirates, board other ships, rescue people and kill aliens is just superb. We've just finished a game at 90% to earth, we died battling a pirate ship. I am not sure what the next playthrough will look like, but each one is unique in some way. I do agree that there perhaps does need to be some reward for playing instead of starting over from scratch. Perhaps earning rewards such as a new ship or saving for a new ship would be cool, and something new to learn the layout of. I would say though out of all the games we have played together, this ranks as the highest co-op game next to Arizona so far. And also one of the most intense VR experiences. There is something about having a friend or family commanding the ship and battling a pirate whilst you are running around trying to keep systems online and battling whatever boards your ship. Likewise when one of you attacks, the other gets a lock and hops over on a ship you are battling. There are some real intense gameplay to be had here! Can't wait for updates or to see what else they add.","Nov 21, 2017 at 9:04 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 13:41:50.434017,TheDoomGuy,7 ideas to make this a perfect game.,"-Performance performance performance, Got a Gtx 1080, framedrops even at lowest.

-The wrist map can't show you lower floors. I also miss map rotating relatively to you.

-I don't see the ammo level in my inventory unless I pick a weapon (this is awkward).

-I randomnly get a message ""please recenter position"" even I'm not close to a wall.

-Throwing guns is too tricky. Picking something from the floor too, is easy to accidentally grab your weapon.

- I miss selling weapons or dispose garbage I don't want anymore.

-Is easy to fire by accident (and die in result) when managing ship weapons. An ""are you sure?"" message would be nice mostly when you start the fire.

Yet I enjoy the game but there are some essentials that need to be polished.","Nov 23, 2017 at 3:34 AM",4, 0,

Oh yeah, and sprinkle a little Dark Souls in with it, because you're going to die a lot.

You start out with a basic ship (you can unlock up to 7 different ships) and need to make your way back to Earth before the alien mothership reaches it. Each system you jump to has the chance to have a random event or mission that are full of random weapons, enemies and boss fights.

The game is rogue-lite so permadeath results in having to start from the beginning. The game is designed so that every playthrough will feel different and the weapons you will find will vary in style and stats, You won't come across every mission in a single playthrough either (theres a lot of content).","Nov 19, 2017 at 6:20 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 13:41:53.646533,Troubles,"This is a blast, but I will pay for more","Full disclosure, I haven't made it to earth yet.... I keep restarting after losing a crew memeber too early for my liking.  But this game is a blast so far if only comparatively speaking but it could be more.

I love the amount of guns so far.  3 restarts and I have found a different loadout each time.  

Here are some things needed for the current iteration and some additions.  Add health/armor bars for enemies.  It is impossible to tell when one more shot will do it.  Make some of the invironment interactive.... it doesn't have to be the whole tileset, but looking through drawers in Arizona Sunshine was awesome.  And to that point, there needs to be more lootable or scavageable items!  The tilesets look cool but they feel empty.  I would love to find more items even if it was just spacebucks that I could spend with merchants for gear.  Some items to find could be crafting supplies.

To that point, you guys are missing the boat on these awesome weapons being custimizable.  If we could craft weapons and enhance them it would add to lootable items and overall gameplay.  Modding weapons in RoboRecall is amazing.  This could even be DLC that would be an instant buy for many.  Lootable and craftable armor with different perks would be usefull too.

Some of the missions are too hard solo.  The robot waves that blow up the mainframe are near unstoppable for me solo.  Maybe I'm too weak, but they instantly start shooting the computer from 3 different spawn points.

Overall this game is great but it is on the cusp of the best VR shooter out there.  It just needs more lootable and interactive invironments.  Even more weapons maybe armor and crafting!","Nov 19, 2017 at 6:48 AM",4, 1,

Also just a personal pref i think the game should include male characters maybe its just me but 90% of time i start with a crew of all females should be 50/50. be prepared for ALOT of glitchs. if u make it past all that its really the best game in vr its like any other VR shoot em up only more maps more ppl more weapons more side stuff just more everything. its really stressful at this point but i really think they can make this into a game that will set a new standard for vr games.

2022-05-28 13:41:59.936943,Lyner,"Really fun, but not without issue.","Think FTL but in VR with more of a focus on missions that send you to hostile space stations, and a little less focus on the space combat. There is also a Borderlands-esque loot system, where the guns you find have different stats and elements on them that get better as you progress. There are also a fairly decent variety of gun types from what I've seen so far. The issue is the difficulty spike. The enemies really quickly get stronger, particularly the robot enemies. After only about 3 space station explorations I started encountering robots that shoot explosive rockets. I would fight two or three at a time, and each one fires a barrage of three rockets in their attacks. All it takes is two hits to kill you. This leads to the only option being to run away as fast as you can while taking pot shots at them, hoping you kill them before you run out of ammo or places to run to. It doesn't help that the interface for changing your weapon or taking out a consumable is clunky. You press a button with one hand to bring your inventory up in front of you, while grabbing the item you want with the other. Not only does this fully disarm you while changing equipment, but often times while trying to grab a specific item or gun I'd randomly grab a different one than I had highlighted. I would have prefered if tapping a button brought up a static inventory, so I wouldn't have to desperately scramble to pull out a health hypo (which is an item that definitely should be quick to access) in the middle of a fight. All in all though, it is one of the better VR games I have played, I do thoroughly enjoy it, and I just hope the devs tweak some things here and there to make it even better.","Nov 16, 2017 at 5:24 AM",4, 0,

I was excited to try the 'smooth' movement option, but found it induced motion sickness almost IMMEDIATELY.  I'm not sure I can fault the game for this.  The problem with smooth movement is that in the real world, your focus is based on the position of your EYES, not your head.  So until VR supports iris scanning, panning while moving will continue to induce motion sickness.

Haven't tried multiplayer, but single player mode quickly devolves as soon as the game starts.  Wandering around the ship, I could find NOTHING to interact with for over 30 minutes before finally getting bored and simply quitting the game.  I'm hoping that multiplayer will prove more interesting, but for now, I feel I've wasted my dollars already.","Nov 18, 2017 at 4:30 AM",3, 0,
