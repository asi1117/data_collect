Now my dream is that they add like new boats, and new lakes you unlock after catching a fish or sumething. Other than that, it's a great game!

2022-05-28 15:10:23.531427,Name110,good but needs a recenter option,This game is a blast and so calming  but there is one problem that really messes with this game. Whenever I start the game i always have to go up to my desk to grab the fishing rod or steer the boat with bangs up the controllers. It would be a lot  easier if there was a option in settings  to recenter and put you in the middile of the boat. Sometimes when i start the front of the boat is facing my bed  which makes fishing impossible. If there is a recenter option that I donot know about please tell me.,"Apr 22, 2021 at 5:13 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:10:26.657067,FrostedLenses,I do wish there was more than one lake,"I love this game quite a lot; it's perfect for relaxing in VR. Most of the other games I enjoy involve quite a bit more effort to play.  
If you have a swivel chair, it'll work fantastically.  
If you want more of an arcade-style game, do not try to find it here. It may not be super realistic, but it is a sim through and through.  
I just love the ""do whatever you want"" feel. I love the feel of the fish popping out of the water. I love feel of casting the line. Reeling the line in. I don't so much love the rowing, but it passes barely and isn't the focus.  
I love the updates, the caves were super-cool even though if it highlighted the struggles with rowing sometimes.  
If you want something stimulating, this honestly isn't for you. This is for you to get away from all the stimulation and just chill on a boat on a lake.  
(Wish there were more lakes to get lost on though.)","Oct 26, 2020 at 12:34 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 15:10:26.686987,Prince_Alki,,"Do you like sitting uselessly in a boat during a rain and thunder storm?  Do you hate sunshine and tranquil time spent in nature?  Do you like spending your fishing time rowing back and forth from one end of a rain-soaked lake to the other?  If so, you'll love Catch and Release.  Clearly the developers looked for the most miserable parts of fishing they could think up and put them in one game.  It is something of a shame.  The game mechanics are pretty good and there are some surprisingly fun aspects to it.  I just got so sick of the rain and the rowing I didn't want to ""play"" any more.","May 20, 2020 at 10:32 AM",2, 7,

2022-05-28 15:10:26.716907,PHLIPdI7Hd,I expected more (Unfair comparison?),"I was very excited to try this game and with the first cast attempt became very frustrated. The fishing wire seems to be constructed of a rubber band, and just flings back and smacks me in the face. I love the rowing mechanics, and the scenery is cool, but this could have been an epic game. If anyone owned a Dreamcast, I'm sure they remember Sega's bass fishing (1997). Do you want a fishing game or a fishing sim? As a fishing sim the 9 other people I know who have bought/played it have given up and 3 of them have not picked up their quest/rift since. (90% product fail ratio, 30% platform fail ratio) I've read other reviews, and the developer is doing a good thing and bringing the non-casual user base to this new and emerging technology. As a fellow developer I understand the significace of appealing to this market. I'll give it another go around, hopefully will update my rating. 

Recommendations
*Implement a mode where you can get a more granular interaction with the fish. (See Sega Bass Fishing). As we gamers age, nostalgia is a big thing. 
*Fix the casting issue
*Spoon feed the player a little bit more
*Weather and time of day randomizations would be cool.","Jan 6, 2020 at 4:38 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 15:10:29.815619,selirian,Good relaxing fishing game,"one of the best vr fishing games i seen , the lake is short but quite beautyfull and full of diferent fishes.
you need diferent things and techniques too catch diferent fish what makes it more chalenging and there are some missions you can follow until you catch the king of the lake.(but is broken)

Edit: all is true but the game is broken a little ahead in the game and i get more than 5 minutes waiting for something to bite at times...
The mission tell me to catch a lake dull i get to the place do everything the game tells and nothing just fishes that should not be there.

This game is a little gem and really gives you the enjoyment of fishing and fully immersis you into a world where you can relax and forget your troubles even if only for a while. And with how easy it is to play and use with the Rift i can still enjoy this great pasttime. The fact that you can do things at your own pace yet there are still goals to work for your not frantically trying to achieve these which for me and my disabilities makes those types of games impossible for me to play for long or even if at all. Thanks to the Devs for such a great game and i look forward to seeing what else you may have for ""release"" in the future and here's to many future hours of fishing.

2022-05-28 15:10:36.106793,Nikorasu,"Looks great, but PLEASE fix casting!","When I cast in real life, I hold down the reel's trigger, swing, and let go at the end of the swing... In this game, I can't figure out how it's supposed to work, when I hold down the trigger, the hook&bobber just fall immediately, which is NOT how a reel is supposed to work. The trigger is supposed to act like a brake on the line, and letting go at the end of the swing casts it out.
I REALLY hope they can change this, or add an option for it, cause otherwise I can't play this.. I fish too much in real life, and I can't change my casting habbit, and it's really frustraiting trying to play this right now. :(

What it does do, it does well. You sit on a lake and catch fish. It's pretty chill. I use it as a de-stressing game a lot.","Jun 2, 2019 at 8:14 PM",5, 0,

I wish there was some better kind of indication when you're going to snap the line though it seems like a bit of a guessing game right now.   And it would be cool if you could get a motor for your boat out of the gear store but I don't think that's an option.  But otherwise it's a good fishing simulator, you do similar actions in game that you would do IRL adding to the realism.    I saw a moose go running by in the forest as well, adds to the entertainment value watching the scenery for things.

Also works great on Rift S, no tracking issues here.","May 29, 2019 at 1:26 AM",4, 1,

Great game to engage in after a long day just to relax and even get in some exercise rowing around :-P

I so wanted to finish the game but for a long stint there was a bug that prevented the 'boss fish' from returning. Then once that problem was patched, Slackjaw boss was like uber and no matter what strategy I tried, he snapped the line. 

After 100 attempts or so gave up, and never got to whatever content might be available after.

2022-05-28 15:10:42.415918,willemocu,Chill,"Very relaxing game.
Altough the fishing mechanic itself could be better.
Like in Pro fishing it feels more realistic (except for small fish feel like 50 pounders) but the fight just feels more real in Pro fishing.
There is pretty much zero warning here when you will snap the line.
But overall very satisfied and worth the money.","Jan 13, 2019 at 2:41 PM",4, 2,

There are some occasional bugs, like fish swiming through the ground, or the bobber flying around like crazy, but it's acceptible for what kind of game it is.

2022-05-28 15:10:42.453816,Cubey,Relaxing fun with nice background detail,"It's a simple, slow-paced game, but that's its strength. Row your boat on a lake with cartoon-style woodland scenery while casting your line. As you catch fish, you earn play money and level up to get better gear so you can go after the big ones.

The background details are light fun: sandwiches and sodas, wildlife (bears, moose and more) wandering past. Insects buzzing past your ear. 

There are some flaws that I hope the developer fixes. 

* It's sometimes hard to manipulate items in the boat, like opening/closing the cooler and lunchbox. You can't transfer things from one hand to the other. 

* There's some oddities with collision boxes. The fishing line, rod, and other objects pass through the boat. This detracts from the immersion a lot.

* If you rotate your view while the line is in the water, it yanks the line around to the new location suddenly, which startles the fish and can send your float flying overhead.

I'd like to see the ability to change the time of day, and the effect that has on fish as some of them take shade under reeds etc. But it's an inexpensive game, so I wouldn't expect extra fancy stuff like that.

I enjoy it still after a few long sessions, and I'll definitely keep playing when I need some indoor downtime.","Nov 19, 2018 at 2:44 AM",4, 15,

I really hope that they decide to add multiplayer, more times of day, maybe expand the lake a bit with a river section and new fish. I also find the fishing mechanics are a bit unclear, I had to look up what I was supposed to be doing.

I have not played it through yet but I hope it will continue to develop and offer new environments, fish, and challenges.  Just remember that the trigger button is used to release the line AND provide the drag, which helps with maintaining the tension on the rod.

The Dev's are awesome and respond to reviews. They were able to fix a save issue in less than a week and now this is my must play VR title!!! Loving the radio by the way!!!

A few ideas (For Dev's)
- Customizeable Characters, Boats, and Rods
- Ability to toss food into your mouth
- Maybe Multiplayer???
- Option for lbs as well as the metric enabled
- More wildlife inlucing birds (eagles...) (I truly love the addition of the bear)
- A long range grab option (hard to get bait that's fallen at times)
- New areas

I did have fun a times and who doesnt like fishing. Things I disklike was the bugs, picking up the scale for example was a nightmare along with changing your poles while a lure is still on the lure will not be removeable and will make you restart your game all the way to the beginning. The biggest bug I came across on my game was I got all the way to the last boss fish, I did the update and no matter where I through the lure no fish you come, the day prior before this new update I had him on the line two times and lost him. I am very disappointed in this game for the lack of smooth running mechanices and memory for your saved game. I even attempted to paddle across the entire lake 8 times throwing out the golden lure. NOTHING. I then force shut down theg game. puts me right back where I started with nothing. TOTAL BUST! dont buy.","Aug 10, 2018 at 7:04 AM",2, 3,"Hey there,

2022-05-28 15:10:48.721054,Tarbal,not bad but needs work,"As someone who does fish in real life, I found some of the controls a little clunky and its really easy to lose a fish in the game compared to real life. 

Something needs to be put in the game that calculates 
A: how well you set the hook
B: the strenth of the line you are using
C: the strenth/weight of the fish
A small fish that has a hook well set should have minimum chance of coming off

Casting felt odd to hold a button to cast and this broke the immersion for me. In real lift, you throw the bail arm over and put your finger on the spool. When you cast, you remove your finger through the cast to release the line. To press a trigger in to have the same effect felt ailen. Maybe you could have it that you press the button in then bress A or B to release the bail arm. Then let go of the trigger to lock the bail arm back over?

Last issue, no left handed option. I fish left handed so everything felt a bit off from the start.

Great start to the game though and hope it continues to be developped","Jun 20, 2018 at 11:16 PM",3, 24,"Thanks for your review and feedback. We're always listening to feedback and use it to shape development as we move forward. As for your request for a left-handed option, that already exists. Simply pick up the rod with your left hand, and the rod will switch over to left-handed mode.

We hope you continue to enjoy Catch & Release and are looking forward to bringing more content to players in the future."
2022-05-28 15:10:48.736014,JonMacBob,A GG with a lot of scope.,"At last a decent Fishing game in VR , this is definitely one of the better if not the best Virtual Reality Angling games I have tried so far , the game I feel is aiming for a more realistic approach with no gimmicks, bells or whistles, just you the rowing boat and a few essential accessories/tackle and a very pleasant location to while away a few hours, bites come thick and fast with a variety of species on offer, So far the main method of fishing is by float and baits such as maggot/grub and some cheese. Graphics are well above average and performance on my system was very decent with no issues at all, the game mechanics and physics could do with a few tweaks here and there, the haptic feedback is spot on, overall a very respectable 4-5 Stars. 
I haven't unlocked too much of the game as yet but I can see the game has quite a lot of scope if the developers continue adding missions , tackle and possibly a few more venues/ locations. I hope the developers continue to build on what they have already created so far and I wish them the best of luck for the future. GG","Jun 9, 2018 at 4:15 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 15:10:48.752968,VinnyGunnz,,"I am playing maxed settings and the game looks and runs great.  It feels like the controls could be a little tighter when you are gripping stuff and reeling the rod, but maybe this is just on my end.  I don't fish in real life, but for some reason I fish every chance I get in games so I thought I'd give this a shot.  There is definitely a calming ambiance to the experience.  You can row around the lake, and when you are fishing you can look into the water and see the fish, and the water effects are nice enough it actually looks like you are looking down into the water.  I'm really glad I got this game, but I do hope they add stuff like more fish, different lakes, different times of day, etc.  If those things were free that would be great, but I'd even be willing to pay for dlc if they had to go that route.  *Edit: I updated to 5/5 stars.

2022-05-28 15:10:51.889579,AzureNight,VR fishing that has me hooked.,"Update: After spending more time with the game, I've changed my mind and will give this game 5 stars. Before I say anything, I have only went fishing in real life for about 40 hours total.

That being said, this game has the best fishing mechanics that I've tried for the VR. The fishing feels real and isn't just something that you can rush but that adds to the experience.  A fast pace fishing game would feel awkward. 

The visuals for the game is nice. It has a cartoonish feel that is very nice to look at and isn't too painful for the eyes if you're going to play the game for hours straight . (Btw if the sun is bothering you then use the hat in game. Hats off to the developers for this idea)

Sound effects wise, I feel like this game has it down. You could just sit down and close your eyes to enjoy the sounds of the lake environment around you. I like to cast my line out and then sit down while I wait for a bite. I play the game with a chair nearby so my feet don't get tired. Plus, standing up in a boat for an hour wouldn't be comfortable in real life. Also imagine rowing standing up. 

I'd recommend this game to someone thats want to relax and unwind after a long hectic day. Just grab a chair and take in the experience that the game has to offer. Don't expect the fish to throw themselves on your hook or your boat. It just adds to the reelism... Get it? 

Did I mention that this game has beer in it?","Jun 9, 2018 at 5:12 PM",5, 14,

Apparently the way the rod is cast is not realistic, but I would have never known without reading a review.  It's a lot of fun for me to just sit and listen to the wildlife while fishing.  I did have to learn to tire the fish out instead of just relentlessly reeling in the line -- that usually ends with a broken line.  Now I have a pretty high success rate with the starter fish.  

I tried the Steam version first, but refunded it because of tracking issues, but it all seems to work a lot better with the Oculus store version.  I am hoping they add more lakes and fish in the future.  I am not sure how many missions are in your journal, but having a goal makes the game a lot more fun so I hope they add lots of those as well.","Jun 17, 2018 at 2:47 PM",5, 2,

Having spent most of my teenage years fishing this experience brought back a lot of fond memories.
The physics and handling felt spot on and I only had a few issues with the fish seemingly popping out the water like on a rocket, but I'm sure this is just a weird bug that can be fixed.
All in all this game gave me a really good sense of fishing on a lake, it's perfect for VR and I can't wait to spend more time exploring this unique experience.","Jun 12, 2018 at 2:50 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:10:51.937451,SeanBoydVR,,"I have sunk in 20 hours to this game now, bought nearly everything from the shop and have the best rod (carbon). This game is so fun and chilled out. The physics of fighting the fish is actually really immersive, rod twitches etc its great. Maybe I love it so much because I fish IRL but still. 5 stars for me!.

PS - I hope there is some new content coming, maybe new lakes? etc.","Jun 14, 2018 at 4:34 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:10:51.953408,InfinityOne,Fishermen need not apply,"Probably the best vr fishing game to date but that doesn't say much.  I question if these devs have ever fished with a spinning rod before?  Because that's not how it works.  You hold the rod in between you index and ring finger where the reel meets the rod.  On top of that you should pull and hold the trigger button down then cast and let go at the right time to simulate a spinning reel cast.  That type of mechanic could be a type of minigame in itself but not here.  Instead you pull the trigger at the right time while you are casting.  If you have never fished I guess its not a big deal but was very disappointing and absolutely killed it for me.  Graphics are not too bad and the atmosphere seems nice and relaxing though.  If you have never fished then I am sure it is fine, but if you have used a spinning reel then get ready for frustration.","Jun 15, 2018 at 10:55 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 15:10:55.052120,PJSHAMOO,Great Game!,"It is an overall Best game, i fish all the time in the real world and this is the best alternative for when its rainy and windy. The only problems i had with it was that the fish dissapear the moment you grab them off the hook, sometimes the game put it on the boat for you but it often releases it to the lake.","Jun 11, 2018 at 9:39 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:10:55.067081,borgiamas,Relaxing,I enjoy playing this after work. Getting out in the middle of the lake on a boat fishing is relaxing. Graphics are decent as well. Only gripe is sometimes reeling in can be a chore trying to make sure my hand movement matches the hand with the line reeler in VR.,"Jun 12, 2018 at 6:04 AM",4, 6,

There is some dissatisfaction in a small place(small lake, radio is interrupted, the system to fishing isnt good. I dont feel fish up...), Anyway I look forward to future update.","Jun 9, 2018 at 11:41 AM",5, 2,
