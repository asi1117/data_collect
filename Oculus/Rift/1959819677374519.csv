How can you not add track and field to your daily play list.  This game is easy to play, and a simple theme.  You can turn on the game and be on the track running within seconds.  Run in place and use your arms for speed.  Used regularly, you can't help but improve your fitness.  The immersion is excellent and you really sense the feeling of running on a track against opponents.  Although this game is great as is, I would love to see the game improved upon with a big budget and the graphics and gameplay of a Creed.  But for now, it is the only game of its kind, so I must give it 10 for novelty.","Apr 2, 2019 at 9:36 PM",4, 9,
