2022-05-28 18:22:33.019770,OculusGameCat,Do Not Buy this game from Oculus store!,"I bought this game while it was on sale in December 2020. I just recently got through my backlog and went to try it a week ago. 
I, like many others on here, am getting the authentication error. I have been in daily contact with UbiSoft support for 4 days. It is obvious by their generic replies to my issue that they are not even reading what I am telling them is happening. 

The first day of correspondence they sent me a link with general things to try... turning off windows startup programs, turning off services, etc. I played along and let them know that telling people to disable all services at startup, other than Windows services, is a bad idea considering that also turns off Oculus services which are needed to open the Oculus software and start the game.
I also told them that this has been happening to people since 2018 according to reviews on here.
I also attached screenshots of my Oculus store receipt for the game.

They replied the next day that authentication errors usually happen when user is logged into the incorrect UbiSoft account. They wanted me to send them all my user names and email addresses that I have used for UbiSoft as well as launcher logs (I only have one account with them!). They also asked me to send them a copy of my reciept... from Steam store! Hello? Why would I have a steam reciept from an Oculus purchase??

I replied the following day letting them know that I don't have a steam reciept and if they were actually reading my messages they would know that. I told them I already sent my reciept from Oculus. I begged them to please come to the Oculus store page and read the reviews so that they could see that MANY are having this issue and have been since 2018. I would think they would have an easy solution by now, or pull it from the Oculus store. 

This morning I woke up to the response of: ""If you are getting an error message with the authentication of Star Wars Bridge Crew..."" 
Are you kidding me right now??! Wow... The worst CS ever!","Mar 23, 2021 at 11:57 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 18:22:33.035727,BlakTouch,frustrated,"Edit:  so you see the date of developer response... and we are now approaching the end of the year and I still have not been able to play this game a single time. 
 REMOVE THIS FROM OCULUS STORE
and I did open a support ticket with Ubisoft, and had one of the absolute worst support experiences and was literally just sent running in circles.  i literally sent them my proof of purchase, the error message that pops up when the game crashes, and sent the crash log file.  they were no help whatsoever.
the fact that i have to open a support ticket to start the game, rather than Ubisoft addressing an issue across many of their games with authentication is a bad look.  There's no other developer that continues to ask me to prove that i bought the game after i bought the game.  This is being treated as resolved for every single game with the issue, but instead is handled on a case by case basis.  A software fix would be much more appropriate so that your customers don't have to deal with this headache for years.   If you are unable to handle the authentication of having your product available from different vendors, then only offer it in-house, on your own platform.  I feel like I'm being punished for buying from Oculus store rather than Ubisoft Connect.  Really can't knock the game, since I didn't play it; strictly a Ubisoft thing, and please believe it's not only authentication from Oculus purchases.  Please look into it at least.

2022-05-28 18:22:33.052681,Pic0o,Also had authentication issue,"Fixed it and support ticket made. Uninstalled, reinstalled (Transference game install) and ran the Transference.exe As Administrator in  '<oculusApps>\Software\ubisoft-montreal-transference\' Login to Ubisoft account until asked for CD Game Key. Then click cancel.
Now run Transference from Oculus menu. Game should activate and push keys to uplay account. Good luck! Just played a few minutes, very creepy and cool concept so far :-)
(Theory) Login to uplay as admin allows the game autenticator for uplay to update, so when Oculus is loaded for 1st time after then, game will activate correctly. Else we get ""Please log in to Uplay and restart the game"" in our headset errors loading Transference","Jan 3, 2021 at 9:22 AM",4, 2,

---------------
Uplay says I don't own the game that I bought through Oculus Home. I'll update the review if I get it working. It shouldn't be this difficult to get a game you bought to load. Ubisoft are known for this problem as you see from other reviews so I usually don't buy their games, but I really wanted to play this title. Ubisoft Support ticket ref: 13434739

2022-05-28 18:22:36.156381,CJFlynn7,Horrible authentication issues Ubisoft,"Transference is a fantastic game, but unfortunately the Oculus version requires authentication through Ubisoft.  Initially the game would not launch, and all I got was an error message that Ubisoft could not verify ownership of the game.  This was after linking my Oculus and Ubisoft accounts.  After 2+ hours with Ubisoft support (and countless ""troubleshooting"" methods that did not work), the game finally shows up in both my Oculus and Ubisoft libraries (required to launch).

You first need to install Uplay PC, then link your Uplay account and Oculus account (with your Facebook account), and finally it works!!

This is one of those games that has moments that make you reflect on just how far we have come. It's one of those games that makes you wonder why everyone isn't experiencing VR horror; becuase if you haven't played a game of this caliber, hve you trully seen all that gaming has to offer? Creepy, unsettling, atmospheric, with a soundtrck that perfectly compliments the visuals. This game stayed with me after it was over and that to me is a hallmark of a great VR experience.","Jan 25, 2020 at 7:39 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:22:36.202258,pappabear1982,Amazing Game with sign on issues,"I have been working with Ubisoft Tech Support since before Christmas and still cannot load this game.  At first they told me to be logged out of uPlay and only be logged in as Admin on Oculus app.  This didn’t work so they had me send them logs thru a support ticket.  Two weeks later I get a follow up saying that I now have to make sure I’m logged into UPlay as it’s an authentication error.  I do this and it still doesn’t work!  Now they want me to send them screenshots of saved games information to see if the game is attached to the wrong account.  I don’t think that the tech team realizes I’m doing this thru Oculus and bought it thru Oculus which was a horrible mistake.  I’m excited to play this based on the trailer so will try one more time to get access.  Oculus should not be selling this game thru their app since I’ve read from others on here who have also had many problems.

UPDATE:  So the issue is that you cannot play unless you have a UPlay account and it is listed as one of your games.  Tech support finally helped resolve my issue by confirming my purchase and then added it to my list of games.  Then I had to be signed into UPlay and launched the game from the Occulus app.

The game itself is intense as you are roaming around trying to find out what happened to this boy.  Haven’t completed the game but hope this review helps those needing to resolve the above type issues.","Jan 7, 2020 at 3:41 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:22:39.295983,MyWy,"Some amazing experiences, others less so","Good points: Strong and intriguing story, with undertones of fear. Possibly the best jump scare in a VR game I've played to date. Nice graphics and sound. Clever layout to make it seem at once maze-like but also keeps you moving forward, rushed but never really on a timer.
Bad points: Ubisoft anti-piracy launcher. Very small gaming world. Overall, I feel under $20 CAD is more appropriate. Slightly annoying controls. The 2D video clips are a little annoying to sit through.","Nov 9, 2019 at 2:50 PM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 18:22:39.325903,WhitesideVFX,Thick with ambience - unsettling,"It looks like this game got a pretty mixed response on it's release.
Personally, I loved it. 
Graphics and sound are top notch. I love the glitchy effects. 
Strangely it reminded me a bit of Zork Nemesis in it's hauntedness. 
The story feels a little muddled at times, but it's pretty solid. The voice acting is great for the most part, though at worst a little cheesy.
The puzzle solving aspect of the game works, but it isn't particularly deep. Its mainly just a find and carry and object to it's place type of puzzle experience. But with the claustrophobic feeling and fear pushing down on you, I hardly noticed that they weren't great until i was thinking about it afterwards.

Recommended buy? - Yes. If you like creepy, unsettling, psychological horror, narrative type experiences. Give it a go.","Sep 16, 2019 at 1:31 PM",5, 5,

But to be honest, it is worse the money as it provides you one of this rare moments of finishing a VR game with a big „Wow“ in your mind.

2022-05-28 18:22:42.458524,rh_galaxy,"Not allowed, takes days and days","I see the other reviews, and will maybe update this one later, if I believe this issue is fixed permanently. It's been 72 hours since I created a ticket with ubisoft, and I'm still not allowed to start the game.

UPlay doesn't think I own the game, ""...a problem authenticating the ownership...""
I have linked Oculus with UPlay account, what more is there to do? The game exists with OH and does not exist in UPlay.

Clearly there are faults that need fixing between UPlay and Oculus, once started the game is probably good. But my first time as an owner of this software is not positive, and for that experience I give 1.

Update: On day 13 I requested a refund, because they wouldn't resolve my ticket, then bought the game again, this time not on sale. It worked now, I believe it is because I now already have UPlay installed and an account there and it being linked to Oculus. The issue is probably not resolved for other new users. The game is pretty, and original, and a lot of work is put in by the developers, so all is good - just this UPlay I still fear for the next game I will buy.","Dec 10, 2018 at 5:20 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 18:22:42.474482,dmdittmer,Ubisofts greed killed the game,"In Ubisoft's DRM frenzy, they are forcing us to use a secondary game launcher. Which, in itself, is rather irritating... had it only worked! Now when the game launches, Ubiplay fails to authenticate my purchase, and refuses to let me in to the game. I had to contact Ubisofts support (twice), only having to file a ticket. One of the support guys told me this:

""Okay, so this was a known issue at the launch of the game that had to do with the game not being pushed through from Oculus. I am not able to add content to accounts, but if you submit a ticket at support.ubi.com, a member of the team there should be able to manually apply the game to your Uplay library.""

24 hours after my purchase, I'm yet to log in to the game. I've heard rumours about Ubisoft's over the top mistrust of the gaming community, but I have to wonder why they are are willing to damage their trade mark in such way, only to save themselves from a small amount of pirates. It seems like their greed knows no bounds!

And if you, like me, think that ""I wont have the same problems like many has""... I promise, you will!

When and IF I ever try the game, I will update my review. But no matter how awesome the game might be, it will hardly be worth all the trouble.","Nov 24, 2018 at 6:04 PM",1, 14,
2022-05-28 18:22:42.489442,Nij,Nothing like you have ever played before,"Wow!! This just absolutely took my breath away, the graphics are absolutely stunning, and don't even get me started on the atmosphere, it totally draws you in and your world just completely flips the more you get into it, feels very much like stranger things with the atmosphere and there are some very scary and surreal moments.  

I had the issue at first where the game crashed but once I logged in with my existing uplay account and let it link to my oculus account, we were good to go

Few glitches here and there which I'm sure can be ironed out, biggest one for me though was with having have 4 sensors, I like to be able to move around but I found if you move too much, it will keep resetting your position in the game which does break immersion, so I'm guessing your not supposed to move really, would be great if they can fix this or you can turn it off

UPDATE
Day 2 of playing this game and honestly, I really don't think I've ever felt immersion on this level before and I was a rift kickstarter, it's on another level, I've had to drag myself off it as got work in 6 hours!","Sep 21, 2018 at 8:18 AM",4, 41,

Like others have mentioned...there are problems with getting this game to launch at all.   Ive been purchasing and playng games through oculus without any issues for a year now. But this game forces ""uplay"" account on you...which means more points of potential problems. Of course, they want your email, but even after making an account..they wont have proof of your purchase.  So good luck trying to get support.  Even on an hour long chat, they finally tell you to send them an email with a screenshot, and all other details. Then you get to sit back and wait. they wont even tell you how long it takes for them to fix it. ...meaning...there'll be no more window for a return/refund if the game doesnt play.   When we buy a game, we shouldnt have to sepnd hours contacting support, emailing and sending screenshots. Read the other reviews...the game will give problems and the support is poor.

If you get stuck - like me - there's easily 5+ hours of gameplay. Graphics are truly awesome, textures often look real. With all setting maxed out and forcing super sampling 2.0 I still got solid 90 fps using GTX 1080. If Ubisoft removes the anti-copy-protection this may rise to become one of the best VR games on the Rift. BTW, this isn't really a horror game - it an adventure game, and one of the best on the Rift.

2022-05-28 18:22:45.681903,Cypher360,An experience that stays with you.,"I really enjoyed Transference. First of all, I went into the experience pretty blind. Just saw a trailer and had a basic understanding of the premise. And I would recommend going in knowing as little as possible. After it was over, I immediately started from the beginning and started playing again for a bit, just to re-experience it with full understanding...well, not full understanding but more understanding. Plus I didn't collect all the videos on the first play through so I'm curious to see all of those.

So, it's a mind-bending journey that had me constantly trying to piece together all the details laid out. The acting is serviceable, the environment is often creepy and unsettling. It's an interesting presentation of logically overlaid video mixed into the world.

My only complaints are minor and don't hugely detract from the game. Both related to movement. I wish you could move a tiny bit faster (ever so slightly), and really dislike when games don't allow me to change my movement direction to be controller-based rather than headset. Especially in a game where it's a lot about watching.

Overall, I think it was a good length (a few hours) and it kept me compelled the whole way through. I recommend trying to play all in one sitting if you can.","Sep 22, 2018 at 11:28 AM",4, 16,

[Edit] Game now fixed and starts (although you may need to restart).  Tried a few minutes so this is not a final review just an update now it is working.  I'm not sure if I am missing something but I didn't have to push the controller stick down to move, I just pushed it forward as per usual so not sure if something has been changed or I missed the point of earlier comments (I can see the issue about movement being slow though, but this is likely much more difficult to fix).

This is a perfect definition of what VR games should be. It's polished, it has amazingly good art design and graphics, it has a non-trivial and exciting story, sound design and music are excellent. This game targets teen-to-adults audience, which is another thing you rarely see in VR.
I've played it to the end on my friends account and was so impressed that I bought it for my account as well to play again at some later point and see what I've missed.

2022-05-28 18:22:52.064831,Fredrix,Great for what it is,"First of all. Yes I had issues before I was able to play the game. First it told me that I could not install the final part of the download (which had something to do with an install from Ubisoft or something), so I restarted Oculus Service and reinstalled the game. This time it finished dowloading the game. However, while trying to load the game it told me that I had no authentication of the game in Uplay. So I put down my headset and saw that I had to accept the linking between the Uplay and Oculus accounts. But it still did not work. So I restarted my computer and tried again. And finally, the game launched.

I played through the whole game in one go, which I feel is the best way of experiencing this game, mostly because you are pretty immersed while playing. The game only took me about two hours to finish and I did find all the videos except for one. So I would say that it is pretty expensive for its length. However, this game has quality, which is expected from a company like Ubisoft, so I was totally fine with the length of the game. But do not expect too much, because you will be walking around in the same appartment through the whole game. But the story, tension and immersion were amazing! 

I give it 5 stars because it was playable. The immersion, story, actors and the tension were amazing. And I would love more games with this kind of quality.","Oct 1, 2018 at 12:48 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:22:55.133623,firebane,Holy this is good!,"Ok, a whole lot of reviews talking about controllers not working right in steam.  That does not apply here.  Controllers were perfect.

I didn't experience any of the log in issues that were being reported below.  Maybe ubi fixed it.  Dunno, but I had no problems.

Normally I'd give this one 4 stars.  The only knocks are the length, it's a very high quality title, but rather short.  Under 2 hours.  Wish there was game to play.  And the other knock would be the movement.  There's just locomotion, which for me is fine, but you move based on the direction you're looking, not the direction of the controller.  Which is not fine.  There should be an option for either.  Head direction locomotion can be pretty intense.  Hope they hear me out.

Otherwise, great job guys.","Sep 19, 2018 at 7:59 AM",5, 11,

Transference is very immersive, good voice acting and production value, I got no motion sickness but the movement is based on Headset rotation and not the Touch Controller, make this at least optional. In VR its all about different options, you should know this, some are already there, like smooth/snap turning, but it could be better. The game is not cheap, Iam ok with it for 2h of fun, because of great immersion and storytelling, I hope we will get some more experiences like that from Ubisoft.","Sep 20, 2018 at 7:50 PM",4, 11,So glad you got it working!

This plays really well, graphics are great, the touch controls work very nicely (unlike apparently the steam implementation).

This is the kind of quality we need to see on Oculus going forwards.

Probably only downside is apparently the length, though I haven't finished it yet so can't comment on that.

Also an option for teleport would be appreciated, as the free movement, though slow, can cause VR sickness.","Sep 20, 2018 at 1:18 AM",5, 3,"Glad to see you got it working! We have a few comfort options in the Settings, but I'll pass on your feedback regarding teleport locomotion."

2022-05-28 18:22:58.290180,nrosko,Worth a buy.,".....I'm unable to start the game says to log in but i already am. I see no Transference in my uplay purchases.
Updated: Game works & has been fixed. 
First of all controls. We have free locomotion , this is a good thing. Direction is controled by the direction you look. This is not a preference for me i prefer using touch. Its not a disaster though & we at least have a straff. The main problem was straff is at half the speed as walking forward so it was a bit of an anoyance & i hope they change that. 
I had no issues with having to press the stick to move. Pressing the stick actually crouched to the floor & this was handy to pick up objects low down. All buttons seemed logically mapped like grab & menu. 
I wished we had more menu options, seems in vr most devs choose not to give us much gfx options which is frustrating. Pixel density should be mandatory in all games imo. At least you get a gamma option wghich is something i don't see too often & i set mine to the lowest & i think that worked well. 
The graphics presentation & art in the game are really well done. I set it to 1.8pd & highest quality shadows & the game ran really well. No issues with colour banding or black smear it was just very solid & stable. There are lots of horror vr games set in an appartment or house but i think this is the best graphicaly so far in that setting. Audio is also very good & designed carefully to enhance the game. 
I enjoyed the story its pretty mental & not exactly clear whats going on but it worked for me. 
The game is fairly scary or I should say unsettling, its not as bad as some vr games though & never felt the need to stop playing. i don't think that is a bad thing as some games in vr are just too much. 
Game was pretty easy, you solve simple puzzles & its short. Some might argue that its not good vaue for money but i actually think it was worth it. When you think what some experiences like titanic vr cost & they are really not nearly as much work as this must have been.","Sep 20, 2018 at 6:33 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 18:22:58.338052,Moike,Finally was able to play through.,"Initial issue: Failure to start / load due to Ubisoft's broken Uplay service. Fix required opening a ticket with Ubisoft support who had to manually tweak my Uplay account licensing to get issue resolved.

The puzzles required a bit of thinking but were not overly difficult.  Not a bad thing when you really want to enjoy the story.

The experience is beautifully done, the atmosphere is goosebump inducing at times, and the audio engineering is wonderful. The jumpscares when they do happen are well done and not telegraphed. The reviews are right, it's like being in a very creepy Black Mirror episode.

Finally, since I was able to play though it in an evening and I thoroughly enjoyed the story... IMHO, for me it was 24 bucks well spent.  I dug it.","Sep 30, 2018 at 4:51 AM",5, 3,

The quality and attention to detail in this title is amazing, the creepy atmosphere and sounds alone are enough to make the hairs stand up.... never mind the clever jump scares.
