2022-05-28 20:37:22.831438,Tr3mors,They blew it,"I've been playing this game since practically release and I liked the core of the game. But with awful game mechanics, lack of transparency from the staff, lack of important updates to keep this game together I can not recommend it.",Feb 8 at 8:26 AM,1, 1,
2022-05-28 20:37:22.847395,YoungOogway,Suprised the hell out of me,Decided to buy despite the steam reviews and boy am I glad I did. The most fun VR multiplayer shooter Ive played and with a friendly community too! I hope they keep updating this game because MAN is it a good time with solid mechanics. If you are skeptical I think its worth a shot because the gameplay was enough for me to believe this was worth every penny,Nov 9 at 1:20 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:37:22.862355,KongKong82,My favorite VR title,"I've played a lot of vr shooters so far, yet this game gets it right.  The player feels a sense of progression as they play and like every match isn't just pointless with the notoriety system. It would be awesome if there was an actual ranked system in place instead of just going off of notoriety in my opinion. Other than that unlocking operators and new abilities opens new ways to play each map.  A very versatile game, wish more people played it. It's sad that it's not on the front page of the oculus store bc this game deserves a ton more players",Oct 31 at 8:00 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:37:22.878312,FNH8iT,Playing since Day 1.. What Has Changed,"Since the release date I have been playing. The release was a REAL Rocky start to this relationship but the roadmap and devs actions showed that this game was promising. The community is where the action is at. The developers reacted to the feedback and within a week had Immersive Sprint added and attacked the Steam VR issues. After a few weeks Vods life was nerfed, 2 handed aiming was introduced along with Manual Reloading. All in which was taken from the community feedback. We are weeks away from the new Payload Game mode being introduced along with a New Map and New Specialist... What can you take away from this? That this game is here to stay and from the Developers turn around time Content Production is fast and clean! Im looking forward to the constant ginds of this game. The Competitiveness of this game brings Esports Teams forming already. I cant wait to tune into the first Tournament.",Sep 18 at 4:12 AM,5, 13,
2022-05-28 20:37:26.000960,squirtmuffin,Keeps getting better,This game really is a lot of fun. Concidering Overwatch is one of my favorite game  i pretty much knew id like this one. It has its fair share of issues like characters balance bugs and man the AI is so bad. But i have faith that in time all of the issues will be addressed in time.,Oct 8 at 3:41 PM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:37:26.015920,Imp7y,Overwatch in VR,"Game has a lot of potential, currently a very good first attempt at the hero shooter in VR.  Some bad systems in place for keeping people playing/engaged and longterm core issues that need to be ironed out, looking forward to the next content update with payload.",Sep 22 at 2:39 AM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:37:26.031877,JFourVR,Manual reload has changed the game!,"I quite enjoyed the game even before the newest two updates. Even looking past the connection issues and the bug fest that the game was, I quite enjoyed it! I saw what it could be but the manual reloads were the biggest thing missing for me. When I saw that they (very promptly) added the feature in, as well as an additional reload mode which I have yet to try out, I was HYPED! But after jumping in I feel like there are some things that they could take from more of the seasoned games in this genere's books. (OW) MAKE SEPERATE CONTROL SETTINGS FOR EACH CHARACTER! If I'm playing Arc-L6, I want manual reload. But if i'm playing chi or calima with dual smgs, I want the quicker style reload, so I can stay in the game without dropping a gun. Better yet if we could select the reload style for each loadout, that would solve all issues related to players feeling comfortable with whatever reload for whatever character they want. Four stars is solid for this game but I know it can be a 5. I just hope it gets more ironed out before professional/compettive become a focus for the team. Still great fun, excited for the future!",Jul 25 at 11:59 PM,4, 4,
2022-05-28 20:37:26.046837,ShocksVR,Immersive Sprinting update; game changer,"Now with the Immersive Sprinting update being available, I'd suggest the devs set the default game sprinting option to Immersive, as most new buyers may not even be aware of the option.

Larcenauts (w/ the sprinting update) is a lot of fun (I have 5 hrs playing it). If you like fast paced Hero-Shooters, then this is your game (as a HUGE Team Fortress 2 fan I've been waiting a long time for a VR game like this). Ya there's some polish the game still needs, but the devs have proven to be very responsive to feedback. If you're a big fan of: Team Fortress, Overwatch, Apex Legends, then I recommend giving Larcenauts a try !

Most of my playtime is on the Quest2, but using Airlink gives you a better graphical and fps experience (90 hz). Crossbuy and Crossplay.

Additional Topics brought up by other reviewers:

Auto-Reloads ? Not as bad as ppl might think. Sure manual reloads would be 'more immersive', but this is a fast paced, chaotic game that requires both hands to be available to play. Anyone manually reloading with 2 hands will be at a competitive disadvantage; although this may make the 'enlightened newbs' happy. That being said, the devs have stated they're working on adding manual reloads (see Road Map on discord; although, I'd probably stick with auto-reloads)

2 Handed Aiming ? Ya this should be present in the game, and it's currently on the developer Road Map. Right now, your off hand stabilizes the big guns (reduced recoil) and/or enables a secondary fire for other guns. But, aiming is still solely controlled by your primary hand. 2 Handed aiming would make the game better, although it plays pretty good in its current state.

Other gripes - character unlocks should be easier. It can be frustrating playing a match where the other team has 1-2 medics, but on your team no one has medic unlocked yet (including myself). Same applies to the other characters.

Overall, the game is in a pretty good state (remember to enable Immersive Sprinting).","Jun 20, 2021 at 3:32 AM",4, 23,

2022-05-28 20:37:29.165496,shugghead,Larcenauts is Overwatch with Oversights,"Is this the overwatch of VR? Yes, kinda…well it could be. This is a polished, good looking title by a developer that knows how to get the most out of lower end VR hardware while letting the PC version shine. Unfortunately as much as Larcenauts impressed me, it also really frustrated me, as I hate seeing a game with so much potential, launch light on content and with some puzzling oversights in regards to how players want to play their game. Simply put I don’t want this to turn into another Space Junkies. That being said the game actually plays faster than I thought it would,  a concern I was very vocal about and most importantly it’s fun, and made even better when with a good group of people. As such to say this game has lots of potential would a huge understatement.

2022-05-28 20:37:29.180456,FutureShock_,"Great game, PC performance is subpar","I already reviewed this for the Quest platform and had a lot of positive things to say about it there. For this review, I'm just going to call people's attention to the performance while still giving it five stars because I think it deserves it.

The PC version is pretty much the same except for some visual flourishes, however after doing quite a bit of GPU profiling, I've come to find that this game is way more taxing on my hardware than it should be. It is more demanding on my RTX 2080 Super than HL: Alyx, Onward (both 1.7 and 1.8), Boneworks and a number of other demanding games. 

The PC version needs some optimization.",Aug 1 at 7:44 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:37:29.195416,Mastapod,Really fun game!! Overwatch in VR!,"Let me start by saying that I played over 500 hours of Overwatch so I really like hero shooters. This is the closest thing to Overwatch in VR and it is a blast to play! It is definitely not as deep as overwatch with all the strategy and everything but the different heroes still brings a lot of variety to this shooter.

I have pretty much played all the VR shooters like contractors, hyperdash, population one and my favourite one Pavlov! The gun mechanics are not as good as Pavlov that’s for sure but if you like hyperdash simple gun mechanic, you will feel right at home with this title.

A lot of reviews complain about the running mechanic and reload animation and while I admit it is not the best and could be improved, it is really not that bad or game breaking and the game still is a lot of fun!! 

The game overall feels very polished, the graphic are really nice and the game has a ton of replay value with the progression system! Gonna go to sleep but can’t wait to play  more tomorrow.","Jun 19, 2021 at 9:25 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:37:29.210376,Hicks613,"Update is not bad. But still a ""No"".","Some of these updates are too little too late.  Audio somehow feels flat and muted.  It may be stereo, but I can't get any real positional information from this. 
 I can't pinpoint enemy positions with audio and ingame voice is uninspired.  At least give us a radio filter or some indication as to who is talking.
Reloads are cumbersome now and you're switching between grips and triggers for magazines and/or charge leavers.  Also there is a very small level aready to get your fingers to to grab these charge levers which end up with you smashing your controllers together.  *slow clap*  Clearly testing was not done here.  I manually reload all my weapons on all my shooters, and this is the",Jul 29 at 12:15 PM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 20:37:29.225336,dan.medaris,Maybe it should have a PTR,"I think they just made this game very fast and lack alot of fixes and changes. One thing that annoys me is that I played one character (intro character) for a long time and I get exp for the characters I do not play. I am trying to level up Calima and I have so many game plays, but it just seems that they want me to play other characters. (I am trying to unlock everything). Another thing I hate is that some characters that look like they have real characters name are just bots. i think they need to title them as bots, so we can either stay or move on to next match. I like competitive play, but if they are going to pretend that characters are real by putting actual IGN into the system. I feel like they are trying so hard to make people think that we are bots or this game doesnt have much people in it.",Jul 6 at 7:33 AM,2, 2,
2022-05-28 20:37:32.328038,LionheartUK,Devs Clearly never played the game.,"Edit 2** Downgrading this to one star. So all the Hero charicters are locked behind RNG Lotto lootboxes. Ok the boxes are free and earned in game. But its possible to finish the current loot progression and not unlock the all the charicters. Meaning currently you randomly unlock heros and may not beable to obtain the class you want. This is terrible game design and untill this is changed my advice is to pass on this title. you might sink your time and not beable to get access to the heros you want to play. 
Edit** Added one star due to the Imersive sprint update. It does make the game alot better and far more playable. Will update as more issues get fixed**
Game Constantly takes controll away from the player. EG Moving your hands for running & reloading. 
Massive delay between stoping running and being able to aim your gun.
Ingame movements will not match or extend to your own body or reach.
Feals like a Pancake port But not a good one like Dr Beef does. 
Much work needs to be done. 
Devs surly could not have played the game and thought ""This feels Good"".","Jun 19, 2021 at 10:37 PM",1, 5,Hi LionheartUK. Thanks for the feedback.

2022-05-28 20:37:32.388875,brutius,"Fun, buggy, bad language","The game is pretty fun, fast action, deathmatch or capture the point games.  There were bugs with movement and gun holding that happened many times during my 1 hour of play.  I assume they will iron these out over time, but it made the experience frustrating.  Also, in half the games there was the cocky alpha male swearing at how $@#@!% his team mates are, and if anyone spoke up, it made things even worse.  I would really like a MUTE or BLOCK button on an individual basis.","Jun 20, 2021 at 11:59 PM",4, 2,"Hello brutius.

2022-05-28 20:37:35.512520,momotori,The game is unbalanced.,"The game is interesting.
However, it is now very unbalanced as a competitive game.
The characters CHI and VOD are just too strong.
The more I understand the game and play it, the more stressed I become.
It's also a minus that heroes have levels and become stronger without any disadvantages, even though it's a versus game.
It's better to start after the balance has been adjusted.","Jun 24, 2021 at 12:59 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:37:35.527480,Yucci,Recent updates fixed the game for me,"The launch of Larcenauts was not the best. And it was kind of dissapointing, since a lot of their issues got fixed in the matter of days. If they had just fixed these issues or had a playtest program it would've been recieved a lot better by the community.  But they  have fixed so much already, like it's a different game almost. The game is starting to feel a lot better but at the moment it feels like an amazing game that lacks in polish. 

As of right now. I give the game a 4/5, it deserves a 5/5 becuase the game is just so good. But due to the many bugs and the lack of polish I feel like it doesn't deserve the extra star just yet.

On top of that, more content is to come. They're gonna add a season system as well, that introduces new content. I'm really hyped for the future of the game and you should be too if you're into hero shooters like Overwatch or Valorant. 

I think the price of the game should be lowered to 25 dollars instead of 30. It's not a huge price change Even Overwatch is 20 dollars and that game offers so much more. There are currently 4 maps and 8 specialist. None of them feels repetetive tho, the maps always feel fresh. Characters always feels unique. 

I believe this game will become the best team based shooter in VR if it gets some more ""time in the oven"". just to squash those bugs and implement quality of life improvements","Jun 27, 2021 at 2:45 AM",5, 2,

The gun play is interesting and well balanced. Movement and use of touch controllers works despite the inability to remap certain features. 

Over all, Larcenauts brings the deathmatch aspect to vR that previously was only available to traditional gamers. It's fresh, fast and most importantly, fun.","Jun 19, 2021 at 4:47 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:37:41.840595,ParadiseDecay,Overwatch in VR anyone?,"*These are my Impressions Based on the Quest 2 version of the game I have yet to try the Rift version.

My Initial Impressions:
Im a big fan of Impulse Gear, FarPoint on PSVR with the aim controller was amazing. I'm also a bigger fan of this style of mulitplayer game.
I prefer hero based team games over games like Population One, so take that into consideration.
Out of all the Online Multiplayer genre's this is my favourite. Its a cross between Overwatch and Team Fortress.
The game is great with friends but NOT SO GREAT with BOTS, which come across as mindless AI.
Although some people are not going to like this game, it always gave me that one more go feeling, and I found myself enjoying the game a lot more with friends.
ALSO my build was the FULLY UNLOCKED version of the game so I had the full range of characters to choose from.
