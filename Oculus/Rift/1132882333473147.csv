2022-05-28 18:42:13.064598,terbiume65,Possibly the cutest VR game to exist,"I was sold when I saw the thumbnail! The cute cats with a great discount making this game an attractive buy for under 10 dollars. I got in getting what I exactly expected, to have a great time playing with cute cats. I cannot NOT give this game a 5 stars, with a bit of a personal cuteness bias ;). This isn't to say that this game isn't without its flaws. As others reviews have mentioned, the textures isn't really the highest definition and there are little bits of imperfection here and there that may break immersion. However, I must give credit to the makers. From what I know, the makers fushionplay isn't exactly a huge company and this is their first breakthrough to release a game in VR. I want to appreciate how they manage to polish an experience this well despite their team's scale and experiences with VR. They are very underrated and they need to be endorsed and recognized for more games like this to exist VR. Besides, this is one of the few games in the VR ecosystem that appeals to a more casual audience and entirely dedicated to simple fun and cuteness. In the 2D gaming world, these kinds of games are most famously made by nintendo. In the VR world, there's so few! I don't think it is an exaggeration for me to say that this here is the single cutest game you get in VR right now! And we need to encourage smaller makers such as them and motivate more of these kinds games to exist!","Feb 18, 2020 at 10:24 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:42:13.093521,h3rbalist,Adorable!,"I've had this game since early access and I have to say now its complete its a great game to play with the kids.

Me and my children (4 and 8) who both have ASD have clocked up more hours on this one game than I have playing anything else on my rift.
 
I have only ever played in plushy mode so can not comment on the other method of playing but the plushy mode is sooooooo cool and works great if you have the controlly secured nicely.

A must buy for family rifters.","Jul 23, 2019 at 3:57 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:42:13.123441,cybernettr,"Cute idea, but...","1, I thouht the game would start you off with a tutorial about how to attach the controller to your stuffed toy with rubber bands (like was mentioned in the promo video). How the controller is attached has a lot to do with whether the  virtual cat is oriented the same way as your stuffed cat. If they don't match, it just doesn't ""feel"" right. 2. what is the point of having to squeeze the trigger to pick up the cat? If you have to feel for the trigger, it doesn't feel like you're picking up an actual cat. 3. why didn't they let you use your second controller as a  virtual hand? This would aid in interacting with the cat, pressing buttons, etc. 4. The cat animations are limited. For example, when you pick up the csat, it doesn't ""droop"" in your hand the way a real cat would. 5. Maybe there should be a warning, because people with a mouse phobia may be freaked out by some of the games!","Dec 13, 2017 at 4:03 PM",3, 5,"Hi Cybernettr.
first of all we are happy that you like the cute idea. The game is still in Early Access and will receive its next update very soon (currently in internal testing stage). Some of your issues are then already adressed.
1. The next version adds a full tutorial for the game. This tutorial (cutely) guides you through the first steps and explains how the game works. Also, when switching to Plushy Mode (this is done by a button in the Options Menu), a video shows you how to attach the controller to the plushy.
2. In the next version you won't have to squeeze the button any more to pick up the cat. Instead, as soon as your hand touches the cat, its picked up. The cat is also automatically released when touching an interactive object.
3. We are thinking about supporting two separate hands. This may be added in a future version. It's not that we don't want that, it's just that it takes much more time to implement this than one might expect. So we focussed on other things for now. But maybe later.
4. We already improved the animations, that the cat looks different depending how you hold it (close to the ground, lifted, holding upwards or flipped.). The next patch also adds new animations for drinking and pooping. (as we eren't happy with that)
5. You are right. Not everyone likes the mice ;) What we did so far, is to create an invisible ""safe zone"" around the player. So the mice will never run into you or touch you.

If you have further questions, just contact us via the forums or EMail. We hope you enjoy the big update that will be released next week. It adds a full tutorial, localization for 5 new languages, loads of graphical enhancements, highscores for the minigames, some new animations and lots of minor enhancements and fixes."
2022-05-28 18:42:16.259054,VR-Nerd,cute little game,"I think this game is more interesting for cat-lovers, girls or kids. Its not an action title where you blow up stuff. Instead its like a tamagotchi that wants to be visited each day.  The cool thing is, that you attach the Touch Controller on one of your plush toys to bring it into VR. What sounds strange works well and adds a lot of immersion. You just hold something fluffy in your hands instead of a Controller. From the gameplay side its pretty basic. You unlock more stuff step by step. There are also some minigames to play as a variety. 
All together: A brave attempt with an interesting gameplay approach that really makes it unique. With hoping that the game will be expanded further during Early Access: 5/5","Dec 17, 2016 at 1:35 AM",5, 25,
2022-05-28 18:42:16.274014,coolguy1076,Almost a good game,"What is really sad about this is that it is almost a really great game, there are just way too many things that cut from real immerision, and bugs that really need to be fixed.  I can only pick up the cat if I pull both controller triggers for some reason, as well as the cat deciding it needs to pass through the floor whenver I put it near something it doesn't like. The title environment is really strange compared to the lovely interior rooms.  Some minigames, particularly the loop one, are an absolute nightmare to complete.  The graphics are nice, but it needs way more polishing before I would classify it as a good game.","Feb 1, 2017 at 1:24 PM",3, 7,"You should give it another try this weekend.
We are constantly enhancing and polising the game and also fix all known bugs, as it is still in early access.

Some examples:
* The bug with the kitten sinking down in the floor was already fixed with the last update.
* The minigames are getting a huge redesign with the patch tomorrow. With the Loop-Minigame we focused on making it easy to access, optimize correct collision detection but still keep it challenging for experienced players. All our internal testers like the new version! :)

But there will be more: version 0.5 is planned for late may and will add the ""late-game-content"" being cute accessories you can unlock for the kitty. Version 0.6 (summer) will then bring the game to a ""beta"" status, polishing all remaining things. That's some sounds, some 3D-models, some textures, animations of the cat, lighting, etc."
