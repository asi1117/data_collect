2022-05-28 15:11:15.700892,znationzem,"Very fun, with some problems.","I love this game a lot, I play it every day! However, there are some annoying bugs. Here are some things I've experienced as an example for future updates. 
1: Upon reset, the blacklight disappears and cannot be respawned until the game is restarted
2: The phone buttons are too small for our massive hands.
3: The hamsters aren't cute enough (That's a joke)
And 4: It's very difficult for us short people to reach things such as the symbol panel or the clock. Those are my only complaints, other than that it's amazing and I highly recommend it!","Jan 19, 2020 at 7:39 AM",4, 23,
2022-05-28 15:11:15.715853,endermine,Great game,"It's hard, but enjoyable. I have ADHD and love pushing stuff, so big plus. I saw someone give this a one-star because of thier beliefs. It's not so bad to se a pentagram lady. The game has a lot of lore to work with for therorists and it is more than an escape room. With something like 37 endings (I think) you'll play the game for a loooooooooooooooong time.","May 5, 2020 at 6:29 AM",5, 27,

2022-05-28 15:11:15.745772,booyaman85,"Awful, Satantic Game.","I'm a christian. I was a cute little game where you are stuck in a room an told not to touch anything. You know when are corner knidergardeners and tell them to not touch the exhibits at the musseum=? But, I find out that this game is a sick satanitc programers fantasy played out. I am ashamed that I bought it. Hidden Pentagram ALERT!","Apr 29, 2020 at 11:47 AM",1, 16,
2022-05-28 15:11:18.876400,Mahekaru,CaptainSauce,"Saw this game while checking out CaptainSauces channel. Looks super funny, and fun. Looking forward to more of your work.","Dec 1, 2018 at 12:45 PM",5, 26,
2022-05-28 15:11:18.890362,TripsUpStairs,"Fun, but puzzle out of reach","I love this game and I have the original 2d version, but here's the thing: I keep trying to re-center so I can reach a panel placed kinda high, and it never works so I won't ever be able to complete one of the endings. This is endlessly frustrating to me because there was literally no reason to put tiny buttons so far above my head. They could've gone somewhere else within arm's reach or at least given me the option of a virtual stepping stool :/","Jul 10, 2018 at 10:19 PM",4, 36,
2022-05-28 15:11:18.905322,Amaggard,A really great game,"It's a very deep and fun game and bringing it to VR was an amazing decision. I really love this game and would recommend it to anyone with a Rift, and anyone with a pc for the normal game.","Apr 18, 2018 at 5:55 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 15:11:18.920282,Renemouse,Harder than many puzzle rooms,"So this is actually quite a tough game, in places. Everything I've solved so far had a logical solution, although I have many more endings still to beat. Each ending is only a few steps, and by ""ending"" I literally just mean the picture on the screen changes and you get an achievement. 

Unlike many puzzle rooms, this doesn't seem to offer much in the way of hints. That immediately makes it harder than many other games. It's probably not  agame to show inexperienced players and not a good intro to VR (try Abode instead). However, if you want a moderate challenge, this may be worthwhile.","Dec 25, 2017 at 1:43 AM",4, 15,

2022-05-28 15:11:22.052903,FastLawyer,Don't touch my wallet ... refund denied,"So there are some logical puzzles and even some that are quite difficult.  You'll have to figure out morse code (or this VR version of it anyways).  You shine a blue light and you'll see all the difficult puzzles you'll have to deal with.  Well, that's already not that interesting to me.  But at least there's a logic to them for the most part.  But then you have totally random puzzles.  Like input the 4 digit code on the panel.  So you input various codes from 4 digits that are written all around the room.  Sound tedious?  Well it is.  And that is this game.  Tedious.  No rhyme or reason to a majority of the content.  Just push this and push that.  Keep pushing it  Something happens.  Pick up that item that just dropped.  Very little dialogue.  Is there a story?  Don't touch anything.  But you're supposed to touch everything.  If you find that funny then maybe this game is for you.  It's not funny to me though.  Can I get a refund, please?  .... Apparently not, Oculus says I have abused the refund system by asking for a few refunds.  Literally, I think I have asked for 5 in my entire purchase history ... but I have almost 100 games.","Dec 22, 2017 at 9:53 AM",2, 63,
2022-05-28 15:11:22.068861,TenaciousADD,Best experienced with ADHD,"Pros:
-Tons of buttons to push/things to find
-Aliens and demons and chocolate fetuses, oh my!
-Destroy the world with your incompetence over and over again
-Separates the stubborn from the weak (walkthroughs are for chumps, kids)

Cons
-Key items have a habit of disappearing even following resetting the room (you'll have to quit/reload for them to actually respawn)
-Furry rodents cannot be picked up and loved on
-Game wants you to touch EVERYTHING but you cannot actually touch everything #SAD","Aug 14, 2017 at 5:26 AM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 15:11:22.083820,GenericallyNamed,"it's a cool game, but easy to get bored.","the room is mostly static objects, you can really only interact with the main panel-thingy.
needs more to do, and really add some stuff to just make it interesting.","Sep 30, 2017 at 3:47 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:11:22.097783,Novitas,Huge disappointment,"Just so you all know, the reviewer ""Augieray"" was describing ""I Expect You To Die."" How does this game include any ""Bond-style fun?"" Anyway, this game lacks three very important things...a story, good physics, and basic logic. Whenever you get to an ending for the game you never get a feeling of accomplishment, because all you had to do to get to that ending was keep touching things randomly untill something happened. I would like my money back but I'm not going to hold my breath. Thank God this game was only $18.","Jan 26, 2017 at 12:58 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 15:11:22.112744,thekjun1,Fun game but not easy to learn,"there are multiple outcomes in this one, but you have to use diffrent buttons and switches in diffrent order or positions to change them. its fun as long as you pay attention to small details in the game. it makes you solve puzzles that are not so easy to solve","Jan 28, 2017 at 12:58 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:11:25.194500,AnotherCrazyCanadian,"Very pleasant, + for the Touch","Some people argue there's a lack of content, but I very much enjoy it and I do find it much more tricky than anything else on the market place. Plays terrifically with the Oculus Touch controller, much better than the Xbox controller.","Jan 16, 2017 at 7:39 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:11:25.210458,Arranox,Not the brain teaser i was looking for.,"i bought this for the puzzles and becouse it looked like fun, so spoiler alert:
you push the red button once it opens a code panel. you try a different set of combination based on numbers/clues you find around the room and its starting to get booring then you try different random codes then you realise that the code can be between 000001 and 99999. then you do the thing that dont make any sense, you push the big red button countless times and suddenly a screwdriver appears, push the red butten some more times and a hammer appears, you finally complete a few endings and everytime you started out pushing the one button countless times. The game have a few real puzzles but its mixed in with random and senseless things. so the game was just boring in my opinion.","Jan 6, 2017 at 11:50 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 15:11:25.224421,Codexus,Lacks a story,"It's hard to stay motivated to work on the puzzles when there doesn't seem to be a story behind them. At one point I couldn't even tell if I had succeeded or not from the game's confusing feedback. It also got repetitive as you have to constantly redo previously solved puzzles.

I love adventure games and puzzles but this felt pretty pointless.","Dec 26, 2016 at 7:51 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:11:25.239380,Olsonadr,Fantastic Redesign,Moving from 2D pixel art to 3D VR has never been done better! This is one of the most interesting and weird puzzle game I've played and it kept me engaged as I figured out each obscure route to the endings. The added touch of the enviornment shifting when some endings are achieved is also fantastic. Touch support is also super awesome looking!,"Dec 7, 2016 at 9:30 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:11:25.254340,brettins,,"I got bored pretty quickly. There wasn't any real compelling reason to continue finding ""routes"" to endings. Maybe the ones I found just weren't very entertaining ones, or not the best ones, but I wasn't compelled to look for more after the first few.","Jan 1, 2017 at 4:40 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:11:28.343079,RedJimi,A Good find (and click),"It's a kind of mystery room setting, where you poke around to find what moves and what not. You might also need a mental notepad for some of the stuff, as it get's a bit over it's head at times (can you decipher an ascii code by heart without looking elsewhere?)","Dec 21, 2016 at 8:16 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:11:28.358039,augieray,Engaging but repetitive game,"The premis of this game is terrific, and the opening credits gets you in the mood for some Bond-style fun.  The challenge is that each scenario requires you to iteratively learn, die and repeat to get a little further. The first time you learn to push that button or cut those wires to prevent a bomb from going off, but then you die in the next step and have to repeat it all over again. I got a little weary of having to repeat some of the same steps 10 times as I worked out the entire scenario, but other than that gripe, this is a fun puzzler with good voice talent and interesting albiet cartoony visuals.","Dec 12, 2016 at 1:09 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:11:28.372999,HisLordship,"Fun, gets boring quick","This is a humorous game that keeps u entertained for a couple of hours, but beyond that gets pretty repetative - not much replay value","Dec 24, 2016 at 5:06 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:11:28.387959,mike5906,Buggy Glitchy,This game is so buggy and glitchy it is not ejoyable.  That and it lacks a story to make it at least worth the glitchy stuff.,"Dec 29, 2016 at 10:25 AM",1, 0,

2022-05-28 15:11:31.508613,Octagoncow,"Fine, but nothing special","The game isn't bad, but it's fairly repetative and some of the puzzle solutions don't seem to be easy to figure out without looking up the solution online.","Dec 14, 2016 at 7:37 AM",4, 1,
