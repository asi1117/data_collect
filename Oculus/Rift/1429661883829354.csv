Oculus, when the hell are we Rift owners going to get to view the 5K versions of videos?

This continues through the whole experience, and the slow camera motion might even be worse than the opening! It's clear that the director was just handed a big 360 camera rig, and decided to use it like a normal camera, with plenty of follow shots.

Of course though, its set in the Jurrassic Park universe so one shouldnt expect it to be accurate.  

As far as the content, its great.  I would even pay for a 30 min. to 1 hour experience to follow blue around, and other Dinosaurs ( 30 minutes to an hour each Dinosaurs ). 

What would be even greater though, its to make the whole thing as accurate as we can (based on modern knowledge), and have us see the ordinary life of specific Dinosaur.

Additionally the animation quality in the actual video is terrible. Im not sure if the experience was just running slower than it was supposed to- I hope that was the case- or if the animation department just did a first draft and thought ""Yea good enough."" Sometimes when dinosaurs jump or something they just feel weightless or slowed down, the most notable part where I feel like this is the case is in Part 2 when Blue jumps on the Rex, and also when the Rex bats the other larger dinosaur out of the way. The animation is just wrong and unpolished, and I'd be hesitant to claim it as my own. Actually at the credits sequence you're met with studios and companies, not individual animators.
