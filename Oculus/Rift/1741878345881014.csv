Animation is amateur and there are ridiculous bright white loading screens every 30 seconds, but the imagery is still powerful and moving. The story is really not inspirational or feel good, like touched by an Angel, but instead it leaves you with a real sense of desperation. I recommend checking it out and I wonder if the developer would consider releasing a playlist/ album of the music, which was really excellent.","Jun 21, 2020 at 6:38 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:52:33.151420,JDakotaPowell,Moving,"Felt like a meditation on a mother's love for her son, birth, life, death and the afterlife. Some scenes were eerie, others calming and yet others disturbing - as all the scenes wove together, the experience accumulated impact and power. Overall, I thought this piece was beautifully done.","May 21, 2019 at 6:01 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:52:33.181340,MadeinBrooklynGames,A Truly Moving Experience,"With a fantastic soundtrack, beautiful imagery, and a moving story that strives to shed light on today's social issues, I cannot recommend this experience enough!
Experience this when you are ready for something more than shooters in VR.","Sep 20, 2018 at 10:47 PM",5, 4,
