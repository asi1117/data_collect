My Initial Thoughts:
I feel like this game is trying to be Arizona Sunshine, but never really hits the mark. Graphics are plain and simple, animations feel a bit broken,  but combat feels OK.
I noticed lots of lag in the controls when trying to teleport and after playing games like Saints & Sinners, I feel really spoiled now and indie developers really have a hard bar to reach.","Mar 4, 2020 at 1:17 AM",2, 1,
