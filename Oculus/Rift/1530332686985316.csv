2022-05-28 19:45:00.193498,Casepb,It's dead Jim.,"Unfortunately, this game seems to be abandonware.  What little there is currently is cool.  But I cannot recommend buying this unfinished product that will most likely never be finished.  If the game ever gets finished I will update this review.","Jul 4, 2019 at 3:37 AM",1, 3,

2022-05-28 19:45:00.226919,rodney6587,nomad,there is no sound while playing the game no control options frankly you start the game and have absoulty no idea what your suposed to do except move  around,"Jul 23, 2018 at 3:20 AM",1, 0,"I would recommend checking your sound settings.  The title’s soundtrack was nominated at the Proto Awards for best soundtrack.

As for controls, tilt head to fly and paint the targets.  Works with Ocukus touch too."
2022-05-28 19:45:00.242876,bri_tar,BRING ON THE FINAL PRODUCT!!!,"I'm getting the Space Harrier comparisons - but mix in these flavours also; Star-Fox, Rez, Panzer Dragoon, Sin & Punishment... with a splash of Macross+...Yes, really! When this game is finally released as a full version I reckon we'll have one of the best VR arcade space shooters ever at our disposal!!","Nov 7, 2017 at 5:37 AM",5, 2,"Trust me, I’m trying.  This title is means the world to me."
2022-05-28 19:45:00.258834,GreenSquid772,,"This is very much a rough prototype version of the game – it is short and there is clearly a lot of work still to be done. However, I really feel like ZeroTransform is making something pretty special here. The classic rail shooter gameplay meshes well with VR, and the developers seem to know how to tap into the enhanced sense of scale and spectacle that is one of VR’s greatest strengths. Some of the environments in the new second level are really impressive, especially the ocean at the end – you can really feel the artistic influence of ‘Panzer Dragoon’ and other classic rail shooters here. And of course, the soundtrack by the insanely talented Jake Kaufman is fantastic, especially the epic theme song. I’m very eager to play through future updates to this game!","Jul 7, 2017 at 12:59 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:45:03.381695,DanteLegacy,"Cool shooter, but...","I can see this game has potential, is a very unique shooter. But only two demo Levels 5 minutes long? As an early access at $14.99 for 10 minutes of gameplay, I would rather wait for a full game. Hopefully we get to see more of this game soon, then I give it 5 stars.","Jun 1, 2017 at 2:19 AM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 19:45:03.396654,gg1db,Wouldn't recommend in current state,"Too short, and awkward head control that breaks immersion. I'd rather move around with a joypad, and look around with the rift. Also, the forced path breaks the sense of freedom.","Jul 29, 2017 at 2:46 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:45:03.411615,Azazel08,Unique and Inspiring!,"This was the first VR game that really impressed me years ago. The gameplay and music in this game are incredible. Currently it is short, but very replayable and the new content will be worth the asking price IMO. I am very glad it has made it to Oculus Home and greatly anticipate the updates","Jun 7, 2017 at 3:22 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:45:03.425578,Chowmein,Next generation 'Space Harrier',"Finally! Was looking forward to a game similiar to the old school Space Harrier with excellent music!

Vanguard V is it!! Can't wait for more levels.","Jun 1, 2017 at 3:18 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:45:03.440537,mdm373,,Picked this up when I first got my DK2 and was blown away by how well the rails shooter genre lent it self to VR. It still does and can't wait to see this game keep on growing!,"Jun 2, 2017 at 7:08 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:45:06.557811,skyworxx,Finally!,I loved this from the DK2 days and I'm happy to see its moving forward to a full release. It gives me the amazing feeling I had when I first played Star Fox 64.,"Jun 1, 2017 at 7:38 AM",5, 3,
