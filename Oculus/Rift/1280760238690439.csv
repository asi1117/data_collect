By the way, without existence of anti-racist propaganda I would have never even thought about that different race is better or worse than other.","Mar 19, 2020 at 5:37 AM",1, 18,
2022-05-28 16:34:57.702402,WhitesideVFX,"Good idea, mediocre execution","I see the point of this being in VR. The audience is captured, in a way that isn't really possible in video these days. 
However, the uninspired locations, bad sense of scale, and the non-volumetric characters, badly chroma-keyed and folded onto seats was a pretty big distraction. 
I imagine it may have been down to budgetary reasons, or maybe someone in the initial stages not quite imagining the limits of the technology. Whatever the reasons, the feeling i got from the production was that it could have been better. Way better.
But it is free. And the message is solid. And that is good.","Dec 4, 2019 at 1:01 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 16:35:00.836020,clerythecleric,"Very moving, very fun. Makes you think.","I know nothing of the way black people were treated during the war. I found the VR expierence to be insightful, informative, overall a fun expierence. 100% worth a watch.","May 4, 2019 at 11:57 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:35:00.850980,Overlorded89,Its alright,"Not sure it needs to be in VR. It was just some guy talking about how people are still oppressed like they were back during the first world war. As an experience, this is not enough to warrent VR. If you want to do this sort of thing, where you tell a story of a hundred years ago and the hardships endured by the minorities, I would expect more than just some guy lecturing me, we are in VR for goodness sake, USE IT. Overall, a little underwhelming, pathetic lecture that would prefer to TELL instead of SHOW in VR. Try harder, do better.","Jan 2, 2019 at 6:23 AM",2, 22,
