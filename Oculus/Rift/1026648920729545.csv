2022-05-28 13:10:37.585399,movieguy2121,Good Early VR Game,"Although this was one of the earlier oculus VR games, it is unique in that it can be played seated with an xbox controller. I enjoyed my time with it and it took about 4 hours to complete. It still felt like a full game but I would not go back to it. The graphics were nice, gameplay and story were interesting enough to keep me playing. I played with Quest 2 using airlink, had to turn up supersampling to 1.5 using oculus tray tool to get it looking good. Overall I would recommend it on sale or with a voucher for around $10 or less.",Feb 24 at 11:17 AM,4, 6,
2022-05-28 13:10:37.599867,JackRonet,Good Story with decent gameplay,Intresting game definetly worth to check it. I never run to any kind of problems and especially sickness from vr. It has something that it makes you wonder if any of this is even real on this journy you will get in to it. It was fun and scary i give it 8/10,Feb 27 at 9:17 PM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:10:37.614826,chrisvanloo,Can't recommend this enough!,"i'm a long time vr gamer, since it started with the og vive in 2016. i had this game in my library for a long time but never played it until yesterday. finished it today. i grabbed an old xbox controller i still had lying around and sat on the couch to start this little adventure. i was expecting to be dissapointed as this game is pretty old but really enjoyed the feeling of sitting down playing vr for once! i expected playing with the xbox controller to suck, but it really didn't. it was all pretty intuitive. 
after playing first person vr for so long this third person vr game felt refreshing and i feel like there should be more games like this! 
the story is simple but you keep going to know more, some pretty epic moments that made me go wtf!!
graphics were not all that impressive but it really didn't matter, you should have seen the stuff we played in 2016 holy crap! i didn't encounter any bugs and everything went smooth so extra points for that. 
replayability wise this might take me a while to play again, but i really loved the ride!",Jan 8 at 10:42 PM,5, 6,

2022-05-28 13:10:37.646741,Dantheman825,This game is certainly something,"I'm a little late to the party on this one. I initially held off from buying this game, mostly due to its rather lukewarm reception, plus the fact that this was a game released in VR's early era. And having played it, it does have a few dated aspects. The textures are a little rough, the resolution is rendered at a lower resolution, likely the same res as the CV1, and there's no sort of graphics settings to mess with. Despite all this, it's actually not as bad as it might sound. The textures while muddy, are usually naturally obscured by the darkness of the game. And despite the resolution being lower, it actually wasn't that distracting even on a Quest 2 (though if you really want to, you can probably force the resolution up via the Oculus Debug Tool). This is a third person game, and while I wouldn't say it's really a good showcase of what VR can be like, I don't think this game would be better off without VR. I can't really report on how clunky the controls feel on Touch controllers, but using a gamepad was surprisingly intuitive. And the story is a total mindbend. Ever since I got to the ending, this game has been on my mind ever since. I'm not even gonna say what the ending is like, I'll leave that to you. The game is unfortunately rather short though, I managed to beat it in about 2 sittings, I think it was like 6 hours total.

TL;DR: slightly dated, but not too bad. Good story, but sorta short for price. It might be a little short for $20, but if you happen to get a $10 credit or 30% discount, then give this a shot.",Nov 12 at 9:29 AM,4, 11,
2022-05-28 13:10:40.783955,exion89,Antiquated trash,"I'm sure in 2016 or whenever this game was passable. I really can't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews here for this overpriced title. 

Okay, maybe if you're a massive Lovecraft fan, which I'm not, this could be enjoyable. Not to mention the game is very short around 3 hours. 

They got motion control support, but only barely. All of the in game tutorials show an xbox controller and are not intuitive at all. Every movement seems awkward. The core gameplay loop is just not good, extremely boring and not scary in any way. Anyone saying this game is scary has not played anything good in VR.

Finally, the biggest reason I can't play this game more than 5 minutes is the graphics. With no in game options to adjust graphics you are sitting here with a 3rd person outdated animated HP Lovecraft visual novel running at barely PS2 level detail. Do you really think this is worth $30? Come on, Meta.

I was playing this with a link cable on Quest 2 with a 3080 Ti and set to 120 fps at 1.9x resolution, still was visually atrocious and made no difference. This game could be better if the devs fixed the render scale and added graphics options and decent control scheme but until then, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",Jan 4 at 4:00 PM,1, 1,

2022-05-28 13:10:43.917712,G4mb10r,Cool (literally 🥶),"This game is a bit dated at this point, but still really enjoyable. The 3rd person (sonethimes 1st person) thing is a little awkward at times and trying to platform jump and stuff can be stupidly frustrating (survive a host of monsters just to walk off a ledge just feels so dumb). Also, some of the gameplay (like the ice wall climbing) gets kinda stale after a while. All that being said, the environments are awesome. The story is enjoyable. The whole Lovecraft in the arctic feel is fun and unique. And there aren't a lot of vr games like this, which makes the whole thing refreshing. I really enjoyed it.","May 12, 2021 at 8:56 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 13:10:43.932672,CountGink,Amazing Game,"I’m quite new to VR; the Quest 2 being my first VR headset, and I’m thoroughly enjoying this game, playing it now in 2021.

The visuals are awesome and the game has a wonderfully creepy atmosphere, and a gripping story that hooks you in. 

I’m playing on a Ryzen 5 5600x and RX 6700 XT and the game runs great. I’ve even set the render resolution to 1.4 in the Link software and it still plays extremely smoothly. 

If you like the more recent Tomb Raider games or the Batman series, you’ll love this.

Edge of Nowhere ranks up there with my favourite VR games so far; Half Life Alyx, Lone Echo and Moss.

2022-05-28 13:10:43.963589,kf2010,Good but terrible controls,"Game is pretty good overall-- though I am not a fan of the ending.
My review though will focus on the terrible controls. Granted this was optimized for a gamepad and not yet for the Touch controllers, but the camera moves in weird perspectives as you move, thus making it hard to natural adapt to the movement. I mean, for instance, there are times that you are moving forward, and yet the camera is almost to the side of the character, thus making you do some mental gymnastics as to how you would reflect the movement with the gamepad joystick. The key combinations to firing a gun and throwing rocks are also very unnatural. 

Gameplay wise, I found it pretty engrossing, though the fact that it was not meant as room scale and is not using the Touch controllers make it a bit dated if you're just playing it today. I mean, you can't reach out to actually ""touch"" the VR world-- you are controlling the character via a gamepad or the Touch controllers acting like a gamepad.

I still give it a 4 out of 5 as I do not want to bring the rating down because of my gripes with regard to how the game is controlled.

So still enjoyable, but prepare to play a bit old school VR, if you will.","Feb 23, 2021 at 7:44 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 13:10:43.979546,LoJackUK,Short game with poor controls.,"Edge of Nowhere is an okay game but wasn't worth the $19.99 I paid for it. 

Many of my deaths in this game were caused by the clunky controls, given that much of this game requires you to jump from ledge to ledge, you'd expect the controls to be much tighter and more reliable.

There isn't much to this game, the enviroments are ok but boil down to ""climb ice here"" and ""sneak around here"". You spend your roughly 4 hour campaign essentially throwing rocks and jumping about a bit.

The story is okay, the voice acting is okay, be environment is okay, and the controls/core gameplay mechanics are a bit lackluster.

Graphically I found this game didn't look great even though I am running SS on max, characters in the distance looked pixelated and there are no in-game graphics options to fix this.

Overall, I'd skip this title unless it's on sale for $5-$10","Mar 7, 2021 at 10:32 PM",3, 4,

Interesting story if not slightly repetitive...but boy are the controls dreadful, switching between shot gun, running, jumping and throwing stones....is so clumsy that half the challenge is remembering what button does what....and by the time the character actually reloads or switches out the gun....your likely dead, because he's sooooo slow.

2022-05-28 13:10:47.095276,chavez_ding,Small details,"I love the fact that your character mimics your head movement. You aim your weapon or your headlamp by looking and this forms a connection between the avatar and yourself. It's more intimate than being a spectator in a scene. 

sound design is good. story and the script are solid. enviroment design doesn't have a ton a variety but what you have is well crafted. the gameplay loop can be a bit repetetive but it does add a bit off twist at every level to keep things fresh. 

Overall I'm really impressed. It made me look for other 3rd person vr games.","Dec 28, 2020 at 6:00 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 13:10:50.307303,NotaHumanResource,Loved it!,"I just finished this game on my Quest2 with link on my Alienware. For an older game, the graphics looked just as good as newer games and the environments created by this team are second to none. (Giant Ice caves, flying over vast mountain ranges, running through a rain forest).  This is a 3rd person game which some have complained about, but It worked beautifully in this story driven action/horror game. Think games like Moss. The 3rd person view reduces motion sickness and makes you care about the character.  I completed this in just over 6 hours and stayed until the end credits. This game has an original soundtrack and is linear game. It is suspenseful, beautiful and filled with action and horror elements. If metal Gear Solid, Laura Croft and HP Lovecraft had a baby this would be it. I removed a star because I died a lot . The game gets progressively difficult.  There is also a lot of climbing ice cliffs with ice picks but each is a little different with having to jump to the side to avoid obstacles, repel down ropes, jump over caverns etc. so it at least keeps things interesting and is very exciting when you complete the task and move to the next scene.  I usually hate games where I die repeatedly but this game at least has frequent save points and I stayed until the end for the story and amazing environments.","Dec 3, 2020 at 6:55 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:10:53.381134,mhwood,A Lightweight Copy of Better Games,"This was an okay adventure that lifted gameplay elements from more successful games to tell a mildly horror / sci-fi narrative. This game primarily takes from the Tomb Raider series: the radio chats, the journal readings, the exact animations from icepick climbing to melee attacks to throwing rocks, not to mention literally raiding a tomb. The storyline is just Lost Planet, except set in the past, with Lovecraft vibes. The game is short (3-4 hours), linear (no secrets or alternate routes), and redundant (climbing section, stealth combat section, psychological story section, repeat), there is only one boss which is overly simplistic and short, and the technical issues of first-person story sections feels disjointed (if you turn your head you'll see your character's headless body), but it's still an acceptable game for the $5 spent. There are other third person games which handle this story and gameplay better, such as Chronos and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrific, if you're interested.","Dec 14, 2020 at 1:32 PM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 13:10:53.412556,MacMiskenn,Does disliking how the story turns out..,"...mean that I can give it a lower score? I sure think so.

This is a game meant to be played with Xbox controller. But you still have the option to only use touch. - That's just fine IMO. Though I didn't expect it to be a seated experience. I also didn't do any research about what the is like before playing. It's basically just a third-person game turned into a VR game.

Not to give out spoilers, but the story(predictably) doesn't end on a happy note.
It would have given me a much better feeling if they didn't try to twist the ending in that direction.

You have zero graphic settings. Meaning that even if you have a beefy PC you can't turn up that eye-candy.","Dec 6, 2020 at 9:01 PM",3, 1,

It has a few weaknesses such as inability to adjust the camera angle but everything else makes up for it. Think lara croft meets Lovecraft. Cool story and enjoyable game and was fairly lengthy at 4 hours for me to play. Give it a try!,"Oct 27, 2020 at 3:29 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 13:10:53.443473,Buddhaz_Priest,Fantastic existential horror simulator,"I got onto the VR train rather early with the Rift CV1 back in 2016-ish and this was one of the first full length games I tried. I have always been a huge H.P. Lovecraft fan and when I saw a trailer for this I was in. Full length, complete, and cohesive narrative-based single player VR experiences are pretty few and far between.  Even now in 2020 there are really only a handful of games that don't just feel like a tech demo or just a neat gameplay hook fleshed out into a game. Edge of Nowhere though is FANTASTIC. It has an intriguing, emotional plot to keep you going, and I found myself on 2 or 3 hour marathon sessions in just this game. 

The 3rd person VR gameplay isn't one that I've seen done this well in many games. You expect it to be difficult or to be strange to be the camera as your character runs around, but I found it to be pleasant. No issues with VR sickness for anyone that has tried it that I've seen yet. I think because it's not first person, your brain doesn't struggle to reconcile what you're seeing with what you're feeling. If you have played Lucky's Tale or Chronos, this will feel very familiar. 

I loved the interesting perspective, and the devs use it to great effect. When you see a Great Old One walking across Antarctica with as little regard for you as an ant, the perspective really highlights that classic Lovecraftian existential dread as you come to terms with just how insignificant you are on a cosmic scale, where creatures can be the size of planets, you are little more than a flea. The devs wanted to make you feel small next to these horrors, and they succeeded. 

Whenever one of my friends gets into VR or is on the hunt for a new game to play, I always recommend this game as one of my top three experiences, and so far I haven't had anyone tell me didn't enjoy their time with it. Even my friend who HATES horror and thinks of Lovecraft as excessively verbose and long-winded, enjoyed her time with this one. I'm sure you will too.","Sep 23, 2020 at 5:35 AM",5, 19,

But I have also peaked at some of this game's screenshots further into the gameplay, which look amazing. This game is so beautiful and creepy. So far feels like if Lovecraft's horror stories and John Carpenter's movie ""The Thing"" had a baby, this game would be it.

2 little flaws, which if it wasn't for them, the game would be 6 out of 5 stars!

1. It feels awkward that toggle on the left controlled does both moving and turning, while right toggle only switches on health and weapons stats. I am constantly using right toggle to turn, and get the darn stats instead >:(

2. MOST IMPORTANT: The game would be so much scrarier and immersive if it was 1st person instead of 3rd person. I see a few other reviews mentioning that too. Why oh why wasn't it made in 1st person?","Dec 2, 2020 at 5:54 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 13:10:56.635056,Dalton2K5,Underappreciated Lovecraft game!,"Honestly, I could say the same for most H.P. Lovecraft based games, but this one is excellent.  Now, it is a game made before the Touch controllers got released, making it a very early VR title, but don't let that hold you back, just get comfy and watch madness unravel before your eyes with gameplay heavily inspired by the likes of Uncharted and Last of Us.  
Due to it being an early VR game, the graphical settings are nonexistant, forcing me to use Oculus Tray Tool to get the resolution up to at least the native resolution of my Quest headset, but even supersampled, this game runs without a problem on my RX 5700 XT.  
The only issues I could put towards it is just from the fact that it isn't what one expects from VR these days (could easily be done without VR), and it is a bit short at 5-6 hours with almost no replay value, but for $15-20 that's completely worth it.

2022-05-28 13:10:59.753404,jonb73,Mostly Very Good,"I expected this to be a lot shorter for some reason but every time I felt like the game was coming to its climax I was plunged straight back into the nightmare again.  It was a most(ly) enjoyable six or seven hours  although I'm not sure I'd do another playthrough. It's linear so there isn't anything you can miss really plus I'm not sure I'd want to live through the negative aspects again (more on this below). It's definitely one of the better VR games out there and was beautiful to look at, if a bit repetitive in places after a time.
I enjoyed the third person perspective and thought it worked well although the ability to change the camera's vantage point might have been beneficial at times. I found myself looking over my shoulder occasionally when needing to double back on myself with the camera remaining pointed at whatever angle the devs thought worked best. 
The controls mostly worked but not seemlessly. On some of the scenes requiring lots of jumping I found myself dying a lot. Fortunately the game puts you back to the last checkpoint which is usually fairly close but repetition-until-success is a game mechanic I thought had died out in the 80s. The climactic scene suffered from this for me and having to make repeat attempts (dozens rather than hundreds) at it wasn't fun or challenging but annoying and spoiled the immersion somewhat. I've deducted a star for that as I do feel it spoilt an otherwise very enjoyable dungeon romp. Those instances were limited to just a couple of occasions and it may be my (lack of) skill rather than a flaw in the game's design. But you just had to have the joystick slightly off direction and down the cliff you'd go again and it seemed a bit fiddly.
To conclude I'd definitely recommend this game for its stunning visuals if you're prepared to overlook some of its minor quirks. It's a stealth / tactical game rather than a brute force gun fest so if you're after the latter you may want to overlook this one.","May 26, 2020 at 2:02 AM",4, 1,

This is where VR is and should be heading. on a side note somone give me pilot wings please and having a legit easy way to play any game easily in vr with just a controller would be amazing.

2022-05-28 13:11:03.003352,Comrade_Ivan,Great game; glaring mistake!,"I loved this game. But a forced 3rd person view in VR is a mistake in my opinion. 

I get that it reduces nausea by giving eyes a focus that doesn't change relative positions. But give a player the option to choose immersion over sim sickness - some of us have no issues with motion. Especially for horror titles - watching someone being chased by creatures fades in compassion to actually being chased in first person.

Other than that, the game is A-MA-ZING! Beautiful environments, clever puzzles, a solid story - all bonuses that make this an adventure worth owning.","Jan 6, 2020 at 3:32 AM",4, 10,

2022-05-28 13:11:06.138067,DocktorJones,Simply a MUST play through,"VR is dominated by ""being"" the character. See what it's like playing a game where you simply control the character when a game is designed to be played in VR. Part platformer and part survival horror wrapped with a Lovecraft style bow. It's not 100% perfect but it's incredibly entertaining with lots of amazing moments and a sense of scale and dread few games can match. I want more titles like this.","Jan 1, 2020 at 11:54 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 13:11:06.154025,Inaros,Painfully mediocre.,"There is nothing interesting/unique in Edge of Nowhere. You have mediocre stealth segments which make up the brunt of gameplay, terribly boring climbing segments that serve no other purpose than padding out the game's runtime, forgetable uncharted/tomb raider-esque setpieces, and a story that is not only less interesting than the sources EoN takes inspiration from, but also features the most played-out, uninteresting twist that you have seen countless times before.

The monster designs are decent enough, but there are only 4 monsters, excluding the annyoing urchin-things and the wall-spore-spitters, and you've seen the extent of possible encounters that this sandbox provides in no time at all. Even on the hardest difficulty, supplies were plentiful enough, and given how death has no real consequence, there's nothing to stop the bored/impatient player from brute-forcing their way through each encounter.

Gameplay is most similar to Cabela's Sirvival; Shadows of Katmai and Crash Bandicoot. Yes, that is a sentence I thought I'd never say; but these are strange times we live in. You control your character from a third person perspective, and the camera is always facing forwards. You aim by moving your head, and thats about as far as the game goes to take advantage of being a VR game. It is incredibly derivative of other, better games that you have played before, and being in VR only further accentuates how this game brings nothing of value to the table. Sure, you can look around, and sometimes there will be something looking at you from the shadows, and that's about as exciting as things get.

This game is something you can safely skip. You really are missing out on nothing if you choose not to play this. VR games from a thrid person perspective are great, and do work very well, Moss and Chronos are great examples of games that utilize VR in creative and imaginative ways. Edge of Nowhere is a relic of a time long gone, when no one knew what to do with VR.","Jan 22, 2020 at 4:11 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 13:11:06.169982,motenai82,What a great game!,"I enjoyed every minute of it, this is probably one of the very few lovecraftian games that actually nails the athmosphere and wonder of a Lovecraft story.
Everything you see will horrify you and yet you'll wanna explore more, and know where this adventure will take you.
The world design is nothing short of amazing, the sound design is creepy and spot on, it will make you chill. 
The gameplay is simple but enjoyable. Personally i recommend anyone with some gaming experience to play at the hardest difficulty level, it will just lower your max ammunitions, and it will make for a more challenging and tense and experience.
Only negative note, in my opinion, are a couple of ""cheap"" jumpscares through the game, but if you've watched a reasonable amount of horror movie in your life, you'll know exactly where to expect them.
Overall a great game that you should certainly play whether you're a Lovecraft fan or not.","Dec 16, 2019 at 12:44 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:11:06.185940,Edigs,Great classic!,"Bought this game way back when it was released (had Vive and wanted to play it on Revive). I only quickly tested it tough. It seemed interesting, but the novelty of being in 1st person and having hands in VR was all the rage back then. Also, lots of white colour didn't lend itself too well to low res and strong SDE of first gen VR hmds.

Fast forward 3 years. I just switched to Rift S and when looking for a game to play next I decided to give Edge of Nowhere another try. Wow, I'm glad I waited. The crispness of Rift S screen, higher res and minimal SDE makes the game look gorgeous! Even better, the gameplay itself is awesome! I love it. Very interesting story as well.

If you do though, it's a really cool experience. It's actually longer than a lot of VR games, and the gameplay is pretty well designed and challenging.

I enjoy the third person perspective of this game and I wish more VR games did this sort of style. Not a fan of the ending, but that's subjective. The lovecraftian areas are nice to look at. It's clear that a lot of work went into this game. Gameplay gets a little repetitive though. It might be more enjoyable in shorter bursts rather than finishing it in one long sitting.

It is a terrific experience with many great memorable action sequences.

However, the story was cliche and so so. This is typical, run of the mill, yawn video game storytelling. And there are many gratuitous obnoxious jump scares. That is cheap and compels me to give 4 stars-- I was leaning towards 3.

From the Ratchet and Clank reboot, to this, and now to Spiderman PS4. This game is deeply atmospheric and immersive even though it is in third person. And sure it takes a little while to get used to, but having the sense that you are actually in the world with your character is amazing. The story is deep, dark, unsetteling, and interesting. You feel completely hopeless in this dark and isolated world you are put into, and as your characters mental health slowly starts getting worse you will feel like you are slowly going insane. The game doesn't have a lot of jump scares, but the atmosphere and world building makes sure you never feel at ease.

Jumping over to the more technical side, playing on a GTX 970 and i5, I did have some framerate issues in certain areas of the game. However it wasn't making me feel sick or disrupting gameplay it just slightly took me out of the experience. However this was never during combat, stealth or climbing.

Top notch atmosphere, visuals and sounds. Definitely sucks you in and makes you feel nervous and even throws the odd jump scare at you for good measure. The controls are well done and exposed to you naturally as you play through the game. At first I felt like there should have been a tutorial but you just start doing what you can do, and as you need to do new things or use items, the game guides you.

The checkpoints are frequent, and if you are like me, you will die a lot. My favourite aspect was figuring out how to get out of a given situation, while trying to conserve precious ammunition and health resources. It is definitely not a run and gun game. I played on normal and there was strategy involved. It is very satisfying when you figure out how to get past a particular set of enemies or obstacles.

There is some repetition and frustration if you die a lot, obviously, and it can get annoying. Particularly the 'running while everything is crumbling and you're being chased' sequences. It creates a great sense of urgency, but the controls are not perfect for leaping and running with all abandon. Eventually you memorize where you will need to jump and you get through, but for me those were the weakest parts of the game, although they were visually stunning and intense. I really enjoyed the quiet, tense scenes where you had to figure out how to use stealth and distraction to proceed.

The music and sound were excellent. No complaints there. The sense of emotion matched the scale and depth of the scenery. Breathtaking at times.

Overall I would recommend this highly. It felt like I got a lot of playtime out of it, and I was never bored. It wasn't perfect so I had to give it 4, but it's a solid 94% of a 4!","Feb 17, 2019 at 11:50 AM",4, 3,

***

***

I rather enjoyed it. The atmosphere was absolutely horrifying in spots, and it definitely had an ""At the Mountains of Madness"" feel to it. You get to travel to Providence and Miskatonic University. Plus, there is a Great Old One that might look familiar. The story line was fun, and I loved how it would interplay Antarctica with a 1930s setting.

They turned basic game play such killing monsters or navigating ice caves into puzzles. I agree with other reviews that the basic game play could get somewhat monotonous, but that puzzle approach helped to hold my interest.

Two thumbs up from this Lovecraft aficionado.","Jan 14, 2019 at 11:15 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:11:37.758439,Zaga93,Phenomenal,"The atmosphere & visuals in this game is amazing. The story is skin-crawling delicious. There isn't great variety in mechanics, but that's about the only negative I got, and it isn't a big one as the action is very enjoyable throughout. It leaves you confused, horrified & delighted, finishing off with the most incredible ending. *Highly* recommend, 10/10","Aug 23, 2018 at 8:49 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:11:37.775394,dmdittmer,Don't blink at the end!,"I really enjoyed this game! Truly! I'm not a big fan of horror games normally (yes, I'm somewhat of a sissy), but this one kept me coming back for more. It had just the perfect grim (and freezing) atmosphere, the gut churning moments when you almost fell into oblivion, the jump scares, the recurring need to look behind you just to make sure no monsters were following you. I would describe it like the perfect mix of Indiana Jones (or perhaps Tombraider?) and Carpenters classic The Thing. 

I only have two minor issues, forcing me to remove one star from my review...

First, it does get a bit repetative in the end. The basic game mechanic resembles the Hitman series, where you have to sneak, distract and watch out for the monsters field of view. It's never boring, but the game sure could use some more variation. 

Second, and this really irritates me, is that there is no way to replay a completed section! The ending is a truly WOW-I-CANT-BELIVE-THIS-IS-HAPPENING moment, but if you for some reason missed anything (hint: Look to your left!), you have to play through the whole friggin' game to see it again! Or ask a nice person to send you their save-game. So I guess I'll fondly recall the last hectic seconds of my adventure, knowing that it will soon fade into a distant memory.","Sep 23, 2018 at 5:08 PM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 13:11:44.102107,TowelieMcTowel07,The only true lovecraftian game.,"This game is almost a near remake of the story of At the Mountains of Madness.

I was iffy about third person VR games, but if you like really messed up creatures, explorations, wonder, and lovecraftian-horror, this game is for you. 

Its a short game, but the creature design and the story are just so good, gameplay is basic, you just sneak, shoot, walk, and climb...gameplay reminded me a lot of The Last Of Us with similar sneaking and cinematic walking between ""action sets"". 

Only disappointment was the wonky camera, almost feels as if its done like old side scrolling games, where once you proceed you cant go back, and it feels like theres ever only one way to go...and there is, its very linear. 

But to Lovecraftian fans and fans of weird unsettling stories of the unexplained, its worth it.","Aug 5, 2018 at 9:30 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 13:11:44.137013,Revving,Amazing game,"This game surprised me. When I purchase games on oculus, I don't expect to play it straight through to the end. This game hooked me and kept me entertained for 5 hours. It was an amazing experience and worth the purchase. I own many games and this has the best atmoshere so far.

Graphics: The visuals are stunning and set the mood nicely. You find yourself feeling alone and in a dangerous enviroment. The monsters are well designed and the textures are well defined even in the environment.

Audio: The sound quality in this game is is perfect for the game. There's no unecessary music, just the sounds of the cold desolate environment and eerie monsters lurking about.

Gameplay: 
Pros: The game has a very good stealth aspect, very similar to ""Last of Us"". The attacks and gunplay work very well. The gunplay works with your head aiming and the controller shooting. Overall, the game combines a good mix of stealth and action.

Cons: The gameplay is a platformer with a few issues, but surely not a big deal. Touch controllers are not very intuitive and poorly implemented in this game. You need to use an Xbox controller if you want to have the optimal experience. The game just works very well when used with the controller. 
Jumping to a ledge can sometimes cause you to hang there. This issue rarely ever happened. 

Story: The story is the main draw here. It simply pulls you in and keeps you in suspense till the end. This game gets you thinking and keeps you interested. 

Replay value: Overall, this game has some replay value. There are 3 levels of difficulty and are changeable in-game. Although the story won't change, the game was good enough in my opinion for a few replays. It's definitely one of those games you beat then play again months later. Like watching a good movie more than once.

Conclusion: Overall, I believe this game is worth its value. I don't give high praise to a game lightly. This game is a well designed and implemented platformer.","Jun 14, 2018 at 9:36 PM",5, 11,

But I don't think I'll ever play this one again. Trailer looked awesome, but seriously lacks feel of claustrophobia or terror of its inspiration Dead Space, even in VR. Only jumped in the flashback where the tentacle creature is right behind you.

Each segment though is basically a simpler puzzle version of Playstation's The Last of Us. I think these sneak, rock throw and run parts should have been cut in half probably. A few parts got frustrating - jumping off ledges or ice walls and the game doesn't interpret your movement and you fly off to your death. Especially the collapsing run away parts.

That's a long time for me, I don't usually stay in any one experience too long so that's saying a lot.  It was an all-around good experience!  Make no mistake, this is more of a ""proof of concept"" than a game in my opinion.  The entire duration is on rails, and it gets very tedious in some places.  It's always completely obvious where to go and what to do, and in the very few times it was not completely obvious, the exploration was tedious and boring...  The human character design is very cool!  I wish the team who designed the humans also designed the NPC bad guys.  There's a lot of good stuff going on with the over-the-shoulder mechanics, the perspective and the movement of the character.  There are a lot of problems there too.  The fact that you CANNOT turn your character around is maddening.  I get that in order for every part of the game to be on rails you can't allow people to backtrack, but it was confounding.  The lighting and procedural textures are very poorly implemented and the lighting in particular makes it impossible to suspend disbelief while playing.  Honestly the lighting is the worst part of this VR experience.  There is only one weapon in the game, and that is a shotgun that is used very sparingly.  I think this is an excellent foundation for a someday game that will be refined and perfected.  I would recommend this game because it's a very basic platformer for your Oculus, but for the VR experience I would opt for ""Lucky's Tale"" over this for now.","May 22, 2018 at 4:58 PM",3, 4,

Gameplay is a mix of some stealth, some shooting, and platforming (reminds me of the newer tombraider games with the ice climbing). If you want more stealth, turn the difficulty up. If you wanna be able to shoot more stuff, turn difficulty down. The story isn't anything that will blow you away but as a whole I enjoyed this title. Nice job, devs!","Jun 17, 2018 at 4:36 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 13:11:56.774628,ApocalypseCow,Uncharted Meets FF13,"Spoiler Free:

Combine Uncharted with the bad parts of final fantasy 13 and you get this game.  If you love the gameplay of Uncharted like games, then you will probably like this game well enough.  However, it is very linear, the characters are very meh, and even the ""witty"" protagonist comments range from unconvincing to dumb.  Out of full disclosure I loved the characters and story of the Uncharted series, but didn't love the game-play.

The controls are great most of the time, except when they aren't.  The jumping is super inconsistant... instead of you jumping a set distance, whether or not you make the jump is more tied to how close you were to the edge when you jumped.  This may be how Uncharted works as well, but with the depth perception granted by VR, it really magnifys this.  Also, some of the development was lazy.  You have a shotgun, every time you pick up ammo you get two shells, but you pick up an entire box with at least 4 shells visable.  Granted that is nitpicky... and really there isn't anything largely wrong with this game, its just for me it what a bunch of little stuff that added up to be too much.

Being an older VR game, this doesn't use the touch controllers but wants an Xbox controller instead.  This is not necessarily a bad thing; the controls are immediately familiar as you are moving Victor in third person, but the scale is all VR.  That moment in the end of the trailer when the Cthulhu-like creature looks down on you?  Yeah.  It's YUGE.  There's a moment a little ways into the game where you have to sneak around under it and then race beneath it as it looms over not just the character but you.  I kept letting my guy die because I was too busy gawking at the creature to care about him.  The platforming can be a bit tricky, but that's balanced out by a very friendly checkpoint system that doesn't throw you back very far when you die.  It's a mind-blowing experience, but also pretty spooky at times.  Mind the mature rating, brace for a little vertigo at first, and understand it pre-dates the touch controllers and you should be happy with this one.","Mar 13, 2018 at 3:25 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 13:12:06.244160,XtremeModder,"Great game, well worth the money","Wait for it to go on sale is the first thing I will say.

This game is not overly long but it sucks you in until the very end.  The end was not what I was expecting (but I won't ruin that for anyone).

First off, watching the trailers made me want the game, they did a good job of that.  What I will say is that it is pretty basic and repetitive in terms of the games mechanics and it does get tough at times but overall was well thought out. 

Knowing this, keep in mind it was an early VR release and VR has come quite a ways since then, however it was one of the best 3rd person VR games I could think of (that is paid).  Worth picking up.

Great adventure game  and ran flawlessly on my system (although I'm not surprised).


So why did I give it 4/5 instead of a full 5 stars?  Mainly because it is fairly short and the entire game is more or less the same thing, throw a rock to distract enemies, if they see you, shoot it with your shotgun.  Other than that I believe this game is a good way to show someone new to VR the immersian a VR setup can bring even in a 3rd person environment.","Apr 6, 2018 at 12:03 PM",4, 2,

I played and finished the game with Touch, but there were times were it was obvious to me a game controller was the superior option.

Story is deep and can be comfusing, but enjoyable. The gameplay isn't half bad, however it does get repetitive and if it wasn't for the story would bore me.","Oct 21, 2017 at 7:44 PM",4, 3,

now for any and all negitives I can think are worth mentioning
This game was made for the xbox controller. so when climbing you use the X butto which is to close to the left hand touch controllers joystick, so can be tricky to jump and climb sometimes.

Motion sickness can be an issue if you dont periodically look at the charactor.

as i said can get repeditive at points.

I don't think 4 hours of play is short at this point in VR development as most game you can been in 20 minutes max unless we are talking strategic,war, board games

I love the Lovecraft universe, and this certainly teases that, but doesn't quite reach it. Don't get me wrong, there are some incredible moments with Lovecraftian legends (at full size!) and a decent vibe, but something felt lacking in the end. 

The gameplay itself was balanced and not annoying, if fairly standard. If this were a standard PC game, it'd be pretty run of the mill, VR certainly adds to it. 

The voice actors were superb, as were the sound effects and music. Graphics were fairly flat, low poly, and muted colors. Textures were lacking. I get the reasons behind this, but I've seen better in other games.

The ending felt abrupt, and jarring, and quite unsatisfying. I was expecting a more psychological and intellectual finish. 

I got this for $5 in the Friday the 13th sale, and as such, no regrets and it was generally enjoyable. Had I paid $40 I would have been disappointed. It took me 5.5 hrs to complete.","Oct 20, 2017 at 6:50 AM",3, 1,

This game is situated in the Lovecraft universe and that is AMAZING! But by the end of it you wish to see more about it, about the monsters, story and more shooting action and less hiding. But that is my opinion. 
This game is scary, thrilling and the story is good enough ( wished there was more about the monsters ). 
Your surroundings will make you paranoid. 
graphically the game is very good and controls are nice and smooth. 
The plataform parts are nice and beautiful, beautiful views! 
A problem: This game has not repleability... :/
Btw: This game has the same storyline than Dead Space 1... Wich is good, cuz I liked it.

2022-05-28 13:12:47.513126,the9quad,"Very mediocre game, extra star for VR.","This is a decent enough game for a 1st gen early VR title.

Graphics are about on par with a phone game or maybe an original Xbox title, but it does have a large sense of scale in quite a few areas and also with some of the large enemies... which is always cool in VR.

Enemy design and story are very much typical Lovecraftian. 

Game play is alot of very (very) straightforward platforming/adventure mixed in with some really (really) basic stealth and occasional gun play.  I cant really stress how straightforward and basic the gameplay is, it is fun enough in a weird way, but very basic.

Game takes about 4 hours to complete which is about the right length of time, as it is over right before the simplistic repetitive gameplay wears out its welcome.

 Definitely would not cut it outside of VR, but makes a decent enough VR title.

Played it on a PC with a 1080ti, so I did have the max visuals (2x supersampling as well), they just arent very good despite what others say.","Oct 16, 2017 at 10:16 PM",3, 1,

The majority of the gameplay is climbing, jumping, and sneaking, but there is a really good storyline here. I think there were only two jump scares in the game, but the whole thing was fairly creepy.

There are some good parts, don't get me wrong. But overall it's a chore to get through, and the ENDING SUCKS. I won't give anything away, but it left me feeling angry and unsatisfied.

This game is just mediocre.  I played it on medium difficulty (can't imagine how boring easy would have been).  It's not great or memorable.  It's mostly by the numbers.  Stealth is throwing rocks and doing back stabs.  Platforming is either climbing or jumping.  Paths just open up to exactly where you needed to go.  Ava, your annoying fiance, leaves you and you go chasing after her.  You end up alone in the cold.  There's penguins!  You can't touch them.  You have a flashlight that moves when you move your head and Victor does the same, except when you're moving then he doesn't.  Rinse and repeat throughout.  I only played about 4 hours but it felt like 10.  That's not good.  It played fine without any crashes and it had SOME nice visuals, but otherwise pretty bland artic environment. Jump scares at least kept me from falling asleep.  I guess the game really missed the marking giving the player a sense of exploration.  I never felt that.  At least it plays well and isn't too long.  The last ""kissing"" scene was a saving grace.

I had seen this game had had mixed reviews so bought it not expecting a lot. What I got was a very solid action adventure with some great set pieces, interesting and tense stealth combat and a linear path which despite eliminating any exploration did lead to a very tight and focused game. I found the length was about right and it lasted me nearly a week playing for an hour or so at a time. I bought this along with Chronos which was much more highly rated but I by far preferred this title. I think there might actually be more content in this, Chronos is just padded out with endless repetition as you wonder the same rooms killing the same enemies time after time and dying over and over. In this game you are progressing constantly and always seeing new things. I loved the climbing elements and the character himself is well animated and well voiced.

I bought this on sale so it was pretty cheap and it was definitely worth what I paid. The graphics and gameplay still hold up as a VR game. I just wasn't expecting it to have so many jump scares like it did.

2022-05-28 13:13:09.708525,PerfectConsumer,Meh... (dge of Nowhere),"I had my eye on this game since I purchased the Rift, but since it was always so pricey, I waited for a sale.  It finally became cheaper, and decided to get it, and I have to say after beating it it is absolutely overpriced.  It essentially combines the climbing and combat of Tomb Raider with the stealth and survival themes of The Last of Us, but doesn't approach the quality of either of the titles from which it draws inspiration.  

While the art style is good, the graphics are clearly aimed at the minimum Rift specs, and there is no option to improve them beyond that.  The gameplay involves balancing combat with distraction based stealth - you basically throw rocks to make enemies move away from your intended route.  You will be doing this a lot, and despite my love of stealth, the repetetiveness of the mechanics get old pretty fast.  There are some Tomb Raider-esque climing elements thrown in where you navigate linear tracks that often disintegrate as you traverse them, and this aspect also grows tiresome.  This game feels like it has a tiny handful of gameplay ideas that get repeated over and over again.  

That leaves the story, which is a is clearly inspired by Lovecraft, and was probably the main reason I kept playing.  However, ultimately the payoff just wasn't there, and I felt a bit disappointed at the conclusion.  There are a few in-your-face jump scares during chapter interludes, which will either attract or repell players depending on their tastes.  

If you are looking for a good third person action survival game, this 'aint it, though if you are a horror fan, you may enjoy it more than others.  Edge of Nowhere is a short, predictable adventure with decent art style and a few jump scares thrown in that is neither memorable nor a great representation of the strengths of VR.  At the very least it is a competent third person action-horror game, but I would still only recommend it to fans of the genre - and even then only if its on a very generous sale.","Jul 15, 2017 at 8:04 AM",2, 15,

2022-05-28 13:13:19.270248,inceptional,A quality and fun experience but . . .,"There is basically zero replayability, so you'll go through the game probably one time only and never play it again. And the game only lasts a handful of hours too, which makes is hard to recommend unless you have the cash to spare.

The addition of some branching paths, some hidden areas and secrets to find, and maybe even some bonus modes and stuff for completing sections in fast times or something like that would have been very much welcome.

If, however, you're fine with spending the money on a one-play experience then I'd actually recommend it; it's actually one of the more polished and engaging VR games I've played. But if you want to get good value for your money, and have VR experiences that you will return to time and time again and ultimately get many, many hours of fun from, even if the main campaign only happens to be a handful of hours long, then I woulnd't recomment this game.

But don't get me wrong: It's polished, intersting/engaging, and fun--if you think of it like an expensive extended playable movie experience or something like that.","Jun 22, 2017 at 11:43 PM",3, 11,

2022-05-28 13:13:19.308147,Fluke,Like a snowfield - beautiful but bland,"I like 3rd person adventure games. The Uncharted series and the Tomb Raider reboots are among my favourites, and while I wasn't expecting Edge of Nowhere to live up to those, some nods in their general direction would have been nice.

EoN is utterly linear - there is literally nothing off the beaten path to discover at all. As you take those initial steps forward, it doesn't take long to realise that this is all you'll do, as you're constantly funnelled down a ""corridor"" for the entire game. Some areas might be slightly wider than others, but make no mistake, there's no hidden routes or caves, and every collectable is placed firmly in your path, as if the developers feared  you might miss a scrap of story.

There aren't any puzzles to break up the forward plod either - nothing to tax your mind or creativity. Wall after wall needs to be climbed, but after the first hour you realise they're simply there to slow down your pace and extend the game.

Inventory is simply shotgun shells and rocks, and you'll curse the fact that despite lugging a backpack around, you're limited to a ridiculously small amount purely due to gameplay reasons, and that it was the only way to add a challenge to the game. The problem is that in a lot of places, just one or two extra shots from your gun would wipe out the challenge of an entire area, and each area rapidly becomes the same. You're in a cave - get through the cave without dying, climb a wall out of the cave, and repeat. There is the odd area (especially with a certain giant beasty) that breaks up that monotony, along with the odd hallucination, but it's mostly the same.

VR saves this game in as much as it can. If this had been released as a desktop game, there would have been questions being asked as to what went wrong.","Jun 19, 2017 at 6:51 PM",2, 9,

With twists, psychological elements that make use of VR and small details. (look at the dead bodies of humanoid mutants when they are behind you). Its a very well crafted lovecraftian story, with a lot of tropes and references that you might recongnize, without getting dull. Arstistically its a beautiful game - the landscapes and design of the lovecraftian monsters is top notch. Graphically its ok -the polygon count is sometimes kinda low by todays standards and textures are to bland - VR limitations I guess, but could be way better. Gameplaywise its nothing revolutionary - basicly each level is a big tunnel with some climbing, stealth, fighting or a chase. But the story and presenation makes you forget the basic gameplay very fast. It might get very scary btw, so consider that - the monster ai is suprisignly fun and you can experiment with it for a bit.  I finished the game in 6h feels like a perfect length for this game.

While the use of VR here is great at giving you the sense of scale, I'm still not a fan of the detachment you get when using your VR headset to aim and direct the camera. The reason being is that, you can often lose track of your character when trying to examine your suroundings or aim your gun. Would like to see some use of the right analog stick (which has no function in this game at all) for at least a little camera movement, for example it could control turning your character in a 3d environment and you can still use the tracking of the headset to aim/look around in the frame. This isnt too bad for a game that has a very linear progression path, but it still seems like developers are still struggling with how to best implement the game camera for 3rd person games.  The game is well voice acted and is one of the best looking VR games i've played despite spending alot of time in the dark. Its certainly very atmospheric. The gameplay is fun enough but its really basic stealth gameplay. you make distractions with rocks, some stealth takedowns, and when you get enough ammo u can really go loud and unload on the buggers.  Its fun enough but theres not alot to it. All in all i still feel like we're in the experimental phase for VR third person games, and this is an example of a solid experiance in that regard, but ultimately, i feel like we're knocking on the door of greatness here without steping through the threshold","Jan 9, 2017 at 1:24 AM",3, 3,

This is by far the worst VR purchase I've made so far.","Dec 23, 2016 at 4:55 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 13:13:47.905757,Jippoy,Good Game,"I got this during the winter sale and am pretty impressed with the game.  I've been a fan of Insomniac's games on the Playstation and was glad that they took a dive into the world of VR.  The gameplay mechanics are simple and intuitive and the presentation is done masterfully.  Although this game is not a fully immersive VR experience, the behind the back-semi-VR point of view works for this game and it works well.   I'm giving 4 stars only because I'm not so much a huge fan of the man-fighting-alien genre but that does not in any way detract from the quality of this game.","Jan 7, 2017 at 8:57 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 13:13:47.925703,A.Force,Well worth it,"At first i didnt get the game as i know i get freaked out too easily. But for lack of content i finally got it and im glad i did!

Being as disgusting and dark as it is, i had to take it in several short sessions, but over a couple of days (Maybe 10 hours game time) i finally finished it!

What a game. Great environments, original score, good storyline with excellent voice overs. 

It truly is one of the best made vr full campaign games out there at the moment.","Jan 5, 2017 at 7:03 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 13:13:51.079382,Nexpert,Got what I wanted from it,"I had read it was a short game and it was indeed beatable in two back to back sessions with a very short break in between. As others mentioned, it's a tomb raider/uncharted like game. Did this have to be in VR? No, but it was, and since other games of this type aren't in VR, that's what made it neat to try. Not a lot of heavy gun play, kind of reminded me of The Last of Us in that sense. Got it on sale and don't regret it.","Jan 2, 2017 at 4:50 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:13:51.098332,joehendrey,Highly recommended,"This game sticks to the tried and true action adventure formula from games like the Uncharted Series and the Tomb Raider reboots, but brings it to VR. The story and gameplay are solid, but fairly middle of the road, and if it were releasing on a traditional platform I'd give it 3 stars.

But it's in VR and boy does that make a difference! If you have a Rift and haven't picked this game up yet, it's definitely worth your time.

Just a quick word of warning to people susceptible to VR sickness: this game does move the camera. I personally found I got used to it after a couple of shorter sessions and didn't have any problems, but your mileage may vary","Nov 26, 2016 at 1:44 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 13:13:57.381172,Grievery,Great introduction to VR gaming,"I expected that a 3rd person view would somehow feel unnatural on VR, but this game proved me wrong. It's actually a great way to ease yourself into VR, since the camera doesn't make any rapid movements as you jump and spin around with your character. Some complain that the game is short, but to me it felt just right -- kind of like an extended movie. Long enough to master the mechanics, but short enough to not get boring or grindy. Things can get a little spooky (in a good way), so only avoid if you can't stand any horror elements. Contains couple of cheap jump-scare moments, but hey, it's VR, they just couldn't resist trying them out :D","Dec 22, 2016 at 1:34 AM",4, 1,

To me it gave me a lot of the same feel of Deadspace with the 3rd person view and the monster horror themes. That said it is a little short (6 hours-ish) and there isn't much replayability. Also like a lot of seated VR the VR adds immersion but it doesn't fundimentally alter gameplay from traditional games.

The experience was like both being inside a movie and watching the movie at the same time. The blending of game play and story telling was among the best. The plot had enough twists and turns with great pacing and never felt dragged out. The use of the VR third person and the occasional first person always felt natural without inducing motion sickness. At the climatic end of the game, it was satisfying to be finally reunited with the person my character had spent so much effort searching for, even if in the back of my mind I knew what was coming next.

When you see a giant monster in YOUR FACE it is scary!  No feeling of dizzyness or other typical VR issues just a fun time playing.  I took one star off for the last few levels of the game - I feel like they padded the final few levels to make the game longer and the game seemed to drag a bit near the end.
