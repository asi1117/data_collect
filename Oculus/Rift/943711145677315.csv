2022-05-28 16:51:27.528484,1Kenton1,"Oculus support, but...","You can't use the controllers the Oculus came with.
Won't play game with anything else, so a waste of money for me.

If there are issues with rude gestures, you can still make buttons work without hands showing up.","Oct 3, 2020 at 9:35 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 16:51:27.542447,Kayarri,Amazing Game!,"I was convinced this game wouldn't be very fun. Sometimes people aren't to friendly online. But i convinced myself to buy it and try it out. I found within minutes it was fun, not only that i was laughing. and trying to bs my role with everyone else. people are very friendly and understanding to new players.  and try to help you understand what is happening.","Feb 25, 2019 at 6:43 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 16:51:27.558405,FastLawyer,Over 4 hours later,"I got this on the Black Friday special and I started playing this game thinking I would spend 30 minutes to test it out.  Over 4 hours later and it's now 2:40 am and I had an absolute blast where I met several people and friended many on U-Play.  About the only negative thing about the game was that you do need to use U-play for activation.  I experienced very short queue times for more people (if any) on a Saturday night.  The group was usually full for 8 people.  The players ranged from newbies like me to griseled veterans.  This game benefits from cross-platform support.  Everyone that I came across was there for the role-playing experience.  Very friendly, gaming community.  Mostly adult.  And surpisingly, there were a fair number of female gamers, which was a nice surprise.  And everyone was there just for the social gaming experience.  It's one of the best online social experiences I have ever had.  No racists, no politics, no trolling, just people focused on having a fun game.  Lots of laughs were had.  This is definitely a challenging game to find out who is lying and who is telling the truth.  Each game played differently.  I've already got my money's worth.  The only problem is that the gameplay is so addictive, that it's hard to play just one or two matches, especially if you get grouped up with somebody that you have played with previously.  Must download if social gaming appeals to you.","Nov 27, 2017 at 12:52 AM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 16:51:27.572367,HomemaidEllie,Does not support Touch,"I can't really review much of the game because I can't play it. And, to be fair, the game description does not claim to support Touch controllers. They have their reasons, claiming that they don't want people waving their arms or making inappropirate gestures. But they could have simply allowed the Touch controllers to work as controllers, like most games do. I also tried to play the game with Logitech controllers, which the Oculus Software does recognize. But no support for that either. So unless you have an Xbox controller, don't bother.","Nov 30, 2017 at 2:44 AM",3, 32,
2022-05-28 16:51:27.588324,Mutant-VR,"It isn't dead - great, fun, social game","To all those saying it's dead, well it's not true. I thought it was dead at first. I'm from UK. The first two nights I tried (it was after midnight so not the best time to find local region players), I didn't find anyone. I was on the EU server past midnight. So I couldn't figure out how a Youtuber uploads recent game clips of it with so many players playing and I didn't find any. After research, it looks like you can choose servers to play on (EU, US, AU, AS, JP). As I play really late at night, when Americans are usually playing, I chose the US server. Voila. There were players, lots of them. If you play during EU/UK peak play time, you will also find players. But overall US seems busy. You can check server status at werewolflobbies.com and choose the server that has games. To change servers, go to options, turn over some pages, and you will find setting to choose a different server. So kindly do not call it dead & stop new players buying/joining the game as then otherwise a great game will be dead if you spread false rumours without doing research. As for the game, it's a great social game and is very challenging and a lot of fun. Great way to spend your time in your own virtual party, where you are made to talk, people will have to listen to what you have to say - ie a very social game where everyone has to interact with everybody. It is also very good for building communication skills (listening, talking, speaking skills, taking the lead at times if you want to, learning to deceive, learning to manipluate, learning how to earn others' trust, art of pursuasion, selling yourself), as well as cognitive skills (memory, decision making, multitasking, who to trust, who is lying, analysis, evaluation). It is a very great social game, lots of fun, with with no games the same - & it will improve your social & cognitive skills, and even in your career by equipping you with these skills. So get it Rifters!","Jun 19, 2018 at 10:05 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 16:51:30.741890,mallmagician,DO NOT BUY UNTIL UBI FIX IT!!,"There is a bug that basically reveals some character roles not in play.  Ubi has known about it for weeks, and it occurs all the time.  Ubi have gone out of their way to officially saw that they don't confirm the bug, but acknowledge it as a ""known issue"" - yet have done precisely NOTHING to fix it now some 1 month later.

Logging in finds all servers empty aside from the USA at most times - partly due to people just giving up on the game due to the bugs that Ubi seem content with abandoning....

When you do find people playing - you could easily come across a modded game because they dont have any cheat protection.  Fortunately, these cheats appear to be using it for good for now... i.e. using a mod to fix the bug we have all been complaining about.  

Ubi - Fix it and I'll change my review.","Jun 2, 2017 at 1:34 PM",1, 18,

2022-05-28 16:51:30.786770,doublee22,Only VR game I can play for hours,"Once you find a fun lobby, it's impossible to leave. Tons of fun","Apr 28, 2017 at 7:46 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:51:33.869524,MattBW,Great fun,"This is a simple game, one of my favourites to play outside of VR. It lends itself wonderfully to VR and is a very fun and interactive experience. 

The interaction is all verbal with the exception of emotes. A social game through and through and if you want more this won't be for you. If you want fun and a game of bluffing and intrigue this is for you.","Mar 28, 2017 at 6:30 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:51:33.884484,Abaddon107,Awesome social game,"If you ever played Murderers or Detective at school where you all sit around in a circle and one has to kill while the other finds the murderer... This is about 10x better. It is a game of lies and talking rubbish. So much fun to be had and it is a shame people keep getting put off by this. It is a game of one round yes but each game is different, one minute you can trust someone and the next they are a complete liar. At the end the community is a wonderful group and well worth playing with. Also it is cross platform from Oculus, Steam and PSVR so you can usually get a good game going. Also it runs through Uplay so you can add people easier and contact others out of game (unlike Oculus at the moment)","Feb 9, 2017 at 4:02 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 16:51:33.930362,Teddy_Brosvelt,Buy This Game!,"Great game. Absolutely fun and engaging social game. I would give it five stars except for one problem... Rift user's microphone volume is too low compared to Vive and PSVR users. They need to fix this.

Update: Ubisoft fixed the microphone volume issue and I can wholly recommend this title now. No regrets on this purchase!","Jan 11, 2017 at 2:07 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 16:51:37.061986,Joshuahuk,Great fun,"I am new to the ""Werewolves"" genre and play one of the card games just the other day.

You are put in a group of strangers and have to figure out who the liars are and who is telling the truth. This is great fun, you get to understand how the other players lie and develop your own strategies the more you play. I feel the pricetag is a bit steep but I have pretty much only played this since I bought it.

Also, I understand some older reviews about bugs may be out of date due to updates.","Jan 7, 2017 at 9:15 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:51:37.076946,SinnaBishop,Don't pass this up! An instant favorite,"This is amazingly fun and already one of my most played VR titles. It is highly enjoyable tricking and helping one another and each new match is a whole new experience. The lack of Touch support is a huge blow as it would make this game infinitely better, although I hold out hope that the devs patch it in the future. Even without Touch, this is one of my favorite things to play though and I very highly recommend to anyone looking for a good and silly time.","Dec 11, 2016 at 9:54 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 16:51:37.091906,Burstup,One of my favourite VR games,"I always loved to play ""Werewolves"" and ""Mafia"" at RL parties. Having this as a VR game is awesome. Some games are hilarious and some days I keep saying ""this is my last round, guys"" 10 times in a row, lol.","Jan 7, 2017 at 3:01 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:51:37.106866,hoesterey,Would be fun but doesn't work at all,"To get in a game you first become a spectator... no way to know how many people are in line in front of you.  Worse there is no order to the line, people will drop and get back in before you.  Worse Mics stop working due to crap servers.  I saw about 5 players in the 2 hours I waited unable to talk, though you could tell they were trying.  This happend to me too.  I was able to talk to a friend in game and them when I actually got into the game I could no longer speak.  Don't buy this.","Dec 12, 2016 at 2:33 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 16:51:37.121826,MBchrono,Fun,"*Updated Review 2* Game is hilariously fun.  However, Devs/Oculus lied about Touch support.  Extremely disappointed.  However, devs have updated the game and squashed a lot of bugs.  UBI Soft has confirmed no Touch support, so no use knocking that on this review anymore.","Dec 29, 2016 at 10:16 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:51:40.224527,Wermuth,Really fun but you have to speak english,"This game is something i've been hyped about for while and then i started playing it for a coupole of rounds with the same people each round(more joined, some left) and we got to know each other a bit. I found out one thing about my face on the rift, i can't laugh and stay in the focus view. The game is nicely executed BUT IT NEEDS MOTION CONTROLLER SUPPORT to blossom. I recommend joining the american servers.","Dec 14, 2016 at 10:13 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:51:40.239487,Wavesonics,Good but limited,"I really like this game. There are a few technical issues (studdery character animation, choppy voice), but no show stoppers. My biggest problem is that it's all 1 round games. This makes it pretty lmited for replay. Having multiple days, and more people in each game adds way more depth and replayability. I really hope they add this. Also touch support seems like a no-brainer and would really improve things I think. But they seem pretty invested in the Emote system so I sort of doubt we will ever get this.","Dec 16, 2016 at 7:45 AM",4, 1,
