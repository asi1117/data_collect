2022-05-28 15:11:33.780536,balance99,Overall performance,"The way the game looks is great but the controls are challenging to do and getting mobbed by monsters while frantically summoning a fireball does not help, also for the first boss battle you lose points if the attacks from your enemy dissapear or hit your shield?  What's up with that?  Please fix these.","Feb 7, 2021 at 7:45 AM",3, 40,
2022-05-28 15:11:33.795496,JohnInAk,Just a bit more,"So as some others have pointed out this is a good game that just needs some tweaks here and there to make it so much better. I started playing it when it was still in development and its come ALONG way since then and all the bugs it had back then. But it still needs a few improvements. The spell casting needs some work and there needs to be more spells since your a 'spell caster' after all. While the way to cast is interesting it can be a pain at times if you don't get it exactly correct. (I guess that's why mages in D&D have the fail roll?) Anyways, I'd adjust it so you don't have to be AS exact when casting, after all this is a game. Maybe change it so if you have it set to more difficult it requires more exact movements to cast?","May 7, 2020 at 6:19 AM",4, 67,
2022-05-28 15:11:33.811453,KT_Phoenix,Fun til a bug appeared; no support,"I enjoyed playing this game until the next to last level. I mastered all the weapons, got all the fate cards, and got all the fairy shards. I limited on the last level because my ethereal spears quit working (not able to throw them; phantoms get close enough to do damage). I can't find any way to get support. I left a message at the developer's Discord, but no response so far. I will upgrade this review if I ever get my spears to work correctly. Otherwise, I don't think I can finish what used to be an enjoyable game. Disappointed now.
UPDATE:  Now the game is crashing in the middle of battle, particularly if I start to do well. No problem with other games. Sigh.","Apr 7, 2020 at 10:06 AM",2, 37,

2022-05-28 15:11:33.842371,JeremyC85,This is close to 5 stars!,"Is this game as good as Mage's Tale? No... but its darn close! Its a linear exploration game with light puzzle solving. You are a mage that can use magic attacks by using hand gestures in real time. This works flawlessly most of the time (sometimes you have to repeat the gesture but its not a big deal). The story takes second stage to the enjoyment of exploration and combat with plently of unlockables to hunt down. For info: took me a little over 6 hours to beat the campain taking my time and exploring a lot. There is also an arena mode.

The only reason I knock 1 star off is the graphics aren't up to par with Mage's Tale, Lone Echo, etc. That is NOT to say its bad... game still looks OK and the gameplay makes up for it. 100% worth the full asking price. Love the free locomotion as well!","Jun 28, 2019 at 3:25 PM",4, 27,
2022-05-28 15:11:36.990949,Shemham,Looks stunning hampered by janky control,"This game is stunning, the graphics are fantastic, the whole time I played i felt I was in another reality, however what ruins the game for me is the janky controls, pull trigger twist, pull trigger twist, I perform this gesture exactly the same time and time again but only a 3rd of the time can I materialise a fireball, also the aim with sight then throw! What on earth is that!! By the time I've thrown my heads moved and missed the target. As I say stunnign game but with terrible controls, could have been such an easy fix for the devs!","May 8, 2019 at 1:28 AM",3, 17,

2022-05-28 15:11:37.022865,taquitobuddy,"Not bad, not great","Pros:
The gesture-based spellcasting works well and is fun/immersive
There is a moderate length campaign and arena mode with some replayability
Good voice acting

Cons:
Only 6 spells, which is far, far too few for a game where that is all you do.
Enemies are for the most part boring and repetitive

Overall, I'd give this 2.5 stars, bumped up to 3 because I really like the gesture-based casting.  If this game had 3-4x as many spells and better enemies, would be 4-5 stars.  As it is, fun for 2-3 hours then boring.","Feb 6, 2019 at 2:13 PM",3, 19,
2022-05-28 15:11:37.037824,Emissary000,I finally get to be a Wizard,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I love being able to move my hands in specific sequences, Doctor Strange-like, to cast spells to defeat foes.  It feels very immersive that way.  I think the game developers have a little ways to go to make the visuals that much more realistic, but that being said it still is very awesome.","Feb 1, 2019 at 2:49 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 15:11:37.053781,jim1709,Small Recommendation,"It makes you feel like a real wizard. But I didnt come here to talk about how good this game is, other reviewers did a perfect job of that. For what this game offers I feel like not enough people play it but anyway. I came here to suggest one little recommendation. Audio. Its good but not good enough. What I mean is that when I summon a FROST BOW or lob a FIREBALL at my enemies I want huge sounds, like ice forming around my hand or a big explosion. For small spells sound is good but for those big hitters its not enough of a boom. Please try to improve on this and it will make the experience even better. That being said, 5 stars on review because I cant place 4.5 and 4 is just not fair. Hope you see this and good luck on this game devs!

Update: Welp gotta say... I was really dissapointed when I found that this game has only 6 spells. Now I just gotta drop that one star because upgrades where good enough at the start but no more spells meant it got semi repetitive but I still enjoyed it. Just not good enough for 5 anymore.","Dec 24, 2018 at 7:33 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 15:11:40.170445,itschriscollins,Brilliant gesture spellcasting!,"This game has satisfied my itch for a good magic game that uses gesture based spell casting instead of just buttons. It feels insanely good to be faced with an advancing army of ogres and goblins and to just be able to swipe your hand to summon a magical shield and flick your wrist to load up a fireball.

There's enough spells to give plenty of variety in combat without overloading your memory, and they all look and feel really good. The graphics aren't AAA but they serve the purpose and after the latest major update are looking a lot better.

This is basically a wave based level with a few challenging situtations and a boss fight, it has some lore behind to give a bit of story but it certaibnly won't match up to Skyrim or some other VR titles for story - there are no cutscenes or clever dialogues. But it does what it does very well.","Nov 12, 2018 at 7:02 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 15:11:40.185406,catalysteh,Arcade game lacking presence and story,"The Wizards is an arcade style game that moves fairly quickly, has good locomotion options and feels solid in VR. And that's kind of where the good parts end.

The spells don't feel satisfying enough when you hit with them. The game lacks much sense of presence, as you don't so much feel like you're really there exploring the environments. There doesn't seem to be much of a story, or anything to really draw you into the game.

It's not bad, but it's not great either. Several bugs will hit you while trying to do combat, you'll get stuck in situations you don't want to be in while fumbling to cast spells. 

If you want a basic spell casting arcade type game, this is not a bad experience, but if you're seeking something more in-depth, look else where.","Oct 1, 2018 at 11:52 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 15:11:40.201363,Sassbasket,Action Wizard,"So far I love this game. Having to do the hand movements to cast spells feels pretty smooth and makes me feel like a hardcore action wizard. I love the voice of the guide that talks to you during the game. He sounds great and brings a little personality into things. There were a few places in the game where I could not teleport but ""walking"" worked fine and targeting items to grab with your telekinesis-esque magic is a bit finnicky. But overall I'm having a lot of fun.","Sep 30, 2018 at 9:20 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:11:40.216323,Kinetic_Ken,Great game,"This is a very enjoyable game, and I love that I actually cast the spells.  It feels very real, with the movement gestures, the timing, and especially the vibration, that really helps with immersion.  And I *love* the wizard who talks to you throughout the game!  

I don't care for the spell ""pyroblast"" - a double handed fireball that just feels awkward and cumbersome to cast.  Although you'd think ""Just don't cast it!"", you'd be surprised how easy it is to accidentally cast that when trying to cast lightning instead, they are just close enough that a sloppy lightning cast can make this spell go off.  I wish I had the opportunity to remove it.

It has teleportation and free movement options, but the free movement is surprisingly slow compared to the teleporting.

There are some small issues that I'm surprised haven't been fixed given that this game has been out for at least a year (they mention celebraing their 1-yr anniversary).  There's a missing space on the spell book that says how many more things of spell potential you need to get your next upgrade token.  Since you contantly return to this table probably after every level, it seems like a really easy thing to have noticed.  I like the graphics of breaking the wall to get through, but sometimes the wall is completely broken along the outside (using lightning), but the wall doesn't actually come down, or you have to wait a rather long time and pieces just start dissapearing.  It was a little odd.     

I saw that someone mentioned incredible lag despite being on a fast computer with a great graphics card.  All I can say is he must have had a lot of windows or other programs running in the background, because I have my settings on max and I havent had any lagging at all.  The fact is, its a very nice game, but the graphics are not nearly detailed enough to cause lag unless your computer is already being taxed before starting this game.  

Bottom line (literally):  This is worth adding to your library.","Aug 12, 2018 at 1:16 PM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 15:11:40.232280,FortoldCreation,Great execution,"The controls and combat is very satisfying.  One of the better games for VR.  Graphics are pleasant, and the voice of the narrator is top notch.","Sep 2, 2018 at 2:42 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:11:43.332987,Comah,Worth a buy!,Giving this title 4 out of 5 stars. I feel like I can't give it a full 5 stars because sometimes the tracking just feels off.  I am using 3 sensors and for other games I don't have the same issues.  When I cast a fire ball the throwing feels like it's not registering properly. Along side that with some issues where I can not teleport more than 2 feet infront of me.   Other than that this game is fantastic! I feel like the devs on this game put a lot of time into this creation and I feel like I'm actually in the game at certain moments. The locomotion in my opinion is spot on.  Although this game isn't multiplayer which is why I almost avoided it...I'm glad I gave this game a fair chance.  I would highly recommend this game if you're into anything fantasy or dungeon crawler esque. There is also local and global high scores to keep the replay value up!! Awesome!,"Jun 21, 2018 at 4:14 PM",4, 7,"Hello Comah, thank you for your review! We're glad to hear you enjoy our game. For the short distance teleportation, it is possible that it occurs during the battle when you teleport too much in a short period of time. There is actually a cooldown that prevents teleporting too far away from the enemies."

2022-05-28 15:11:43.362907,DButcha,Inconsistent Thumbstick turning,"No idea why, but turning with the thumb stick is tied to fps. So if your game runs slowly you turn at like half the rate you normally would. Sounds minor but it really ruins gameplay since I don't have a lot of space to actually turn around. You end up getting destroyed by people coming from all angles since you can't turn around fast enough sometimes, really dumb.

Ps I agree that the score and objective display in world is so massive it blocks your view whenever you're trying to look down. Still a fun game though","Jun 11, 2018 at 12:03 PM",4, 4,"Hello DButcha, thank you for leaving your feedback. We are happy that you enjoy our game and sorry to hear about your issues. 

When it comes to turning speed, this is something that you may change in the settings menu. You can also slightly lower graphic settings to make sure that the game keeps running in 90fps. Turning mirroring off is something that increases the performance too. 

For the score and objective interface, please keep in mind that you can minimize or turn it off entirely in game's settings.

We hope that with above tips the game will be even more fun to play for you."

I took so long to change my mind and my review of this game to the 5 stars it deserves(mainly cause I was in Hospital!)
But her I am again at last to give The Wizards the rating it deserves,
 GREAT magic romp with powerful Enemies and interesting Allies,and a good way of sliding you gently into the use of Magic,
I also have to give a shout out to the Devs particularly Pawel for staying in touch the whole time and letting me know when Left Hand Support was implimented(and even giving me Travel tips and a chance to meet up with the Devs if I'm in their neck of the woods!)

Thank you for reporting this issue, we're really sorry that you encountered such problems. Could you please send us an email at: contact@carbonstudio.pl and describe this bug in a little bit more detail? We are determined to solve this problem!"
2022-05-28 15:11:49.666048,flyingsod,Everything seems fine now.,"I had no issues with hand gesturing to enact spells.  In the heat of the moment with two giant orcs appearing unexpectedly of course I'd panic and make jerky hand motions that didnt work.  When I would Teleport down the field and regain my composure and cast the spell with controlled motions  all was flawless. This is how it should be. You can't just wave your hands around willy nilly and expect magic to happen! Harnessing the power takes precise motions in obeyance witht he laws of the cosmos. Dev's please dont change this to make it ""easier"" to cast. I dont want an easy button spell casting game. You might as well put a hotbar on the screen we can just point and clik at. If anything I would appreciate some more complicated spells with very precise motions required to cast. Perhaps a powerful nuke that takes a full 5 or 10 seconds to cast...

  Movement:  It all worked fine. Free movement does get me a bit off balance and make me queasy though. I still appreciate and use it. Teleport for large movements and free move for precision is how ive been doing it. I find it to me a wonderful combination and im very glad both options are available at the same time. good job Devs.

 Game play is really awesome. I feel like im in the world casting spells. Physics are nice. Graphics are def good enough if not photorealistc awesome.  It doesnt spoon feed you hints on how or what to do. You actually explore and discover what to do on your own and it is soooo satisfying to do so. it makes it feel like a real exploration..The voice acting and dialogue are great. I felt like I had a mentor/ friend helping me along. I Havent played enough to comment on the story though. Someone mentioned its just a wave shooter.. I dont see that at all. Maybe they just played a demo or something. It def does not feel like any wave shooter ive ever played.

This game is really cool, like others have said: you really feel like a wizard!
It's definitely harder than the Mage's Tale but it's more realistic with the hand gesture.

I'm not giving it 5 stars because I believe the controls could be polished a little further (it's in early access after all). I like the fact that the game forces you to aim (and it can be adjusted in the menu) but the gesture for the spell casting are a bit random... sometimes I don't know why the spell didn't cast when it felt like I did the same movement as before. Also my hand and arm are sore thanks to repetite fireballs lol","Dec 13, 2017 at 4:32 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 15:11:52.821608,Ploppykins,Quite fun but still needs improvements,"First and foremost if you enjoyed the trailer then you will like this game, the pacing is slower but thats normal with trailers to games nowadays. 
Some good things about this game: its gorgeous, the developers have really put in the effort to craft a world that is breath-taking to look at; the tutorial eases you in to the basic mechanics and gives you time to enjoy yourself in a risk free zone; the free movement feels very weird but its a good kind of weird as its my first game with free movement in VR, i also love the effort that was put in as the sounds will actively change for what you are walking on even if its just a patch of grass in the middle of a cobblestone road.
In order to improve this game i would suggest the following: make the arcane missles spell worth it, by which i mean that the spell for me personally is very difficult to cast as it has to follow a VERY specific movement which i can only seem to do about 10% of the time and when i do the damage is underwhelming; maybe reduce the damage on the lightning spell or increase the charge time as it eradicates anything in a fraction of the time it would take to cast and use other spells; and lastly the fireball spell, in my experience this spell was very hard to aim to begin with but incredibly satisfying to hit the crystals in the tutorial, in the main game however it seemed that my shots were ether going far above the enemy (due to my aim i'll admit) or directly to their crotch... it honestly feels as though in the main game that the fireball has tracking that was not present in the tutorial. 
In conclusion i have very much enjoyed the game so far and hope that others share my views on what should be changed to improve the game. I still recommend it but if you buy, then just like Dark Souls, spam lightning until it gets nerfed.","Nov 5, 2017 at 6:58 PM",4, 13,

2022-05-28 15:11:52.852525,Foruman,Great game,"The game has a lot of potential. I am hoping for a further option regarding the faceing direction after teleporting. This is the second game I have played after robo recall where the teleport works a little different. Thus, I find it much more intuitive if the arrow on the target landing point refers to the orientation of the sensors (like in robo recall) instead of the direction of my view (in this game). 
For the fights I have to use free movement by which I get motion sickness.
I hope I can get used to it or they introduce the said option because apart from the movement system the game is really fun and I like the spell casting a lot.
Update: I got used the teleport mechanism and free movement and it is awesome. Still I would prefer the mechanism to be as I said.

I've tried different techniques and pushing towards your target appears to give me the most success. Unfortunately, I can be standing in front of a target that takes us a majority of my view and it'll throw an arc over the target.","Sep 25, 2017 at 11:23 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:11:59.129736,Vanderhelm,Good wave shooter but needs some work,"TL;DR: I love the spell mechanic, and even though it's a wave shooter it's a good one with excellent production values. It does need lots of polish though.

The graphics are really good.  The sense of presence is  well done, environments feel huge and epic, I specially like the open areas where it feels like the world is huge.  Your Magic sanctum is particularly impressive! I like a lot of the physics based effects like destroying walls.  The enemies are huge and nicely designed, it's easy to tell them apart even from far.

Great sound all around, solid voice acting and good music.

It's a wave shooter, so off the bat it's very similar to every other VR game you've played, and it definitely feels like a video game in spite of the gorgeous environments because of the way the waves of enemies just come at you from the same spawn points over and over.

The way you select your spells is by different (and very clever) hand motions; they feel natural after a while and you'll be waving your hands around to create a fireball, ice bow, etc. in no time.

Unfortunately it's also very buggy; the fireball spell which is your bread and butter is finicky to create, consistently I had to try it several times before I could get a fireball, getting two in a row was impossible on the first try...I found myself just shaking my controller around quickly and that seemed to spawn them a lot faster.

I also had some issues with the ice bow, when drawing an arrow, if the bow is not being held completely vertical it will reset to upright (regardless of how your hand is rotated) so it made for some truly awkward shots.

Sadly, the lack of consistency when picking spells got me killed more than once and it was very frustrating; the ice bow and fireballs in particular since when things are hectic you need to spawn them quickly and in moments of panic it's hard to get the gestures perfectly done; I feel it should be a lot more forgiving when a gesture is not flawlessly performed.","Aug 19, 2017 at 11:57 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 15:11:59.146690,solo7777,UPDATE,"Initial review after: 
After playing around with this some more, the spells are a bit better and I think I am all caught up.  There are a couple of bugs I encountered and will let the team know about what happened. I give 4 stars now, since seeing deeper into this, I understand what initially happened. Don't start with the cards, frankly, ignore them. At least for the first go around. Looking forward to more content. (Hopefully therewill be more soon?!)
----------------------------------
I hope they really work on the spells in this game, because they just don't work very well, with the exception of the lighting. The fireballs go off in every which way except the target, when yo ncan get them to appear. The shield sometimes comes up, if your lucky. If you are in a smaller environment, be careful or you will damage something trying to get the spells to appear (you know, controller through the wall or something) If they get better, I will revisit, but for now, it is shelved. It has potential, just not there yet.","Sep 21, 2017 at 7:31 AM",4, 4,"Dear solo7777, we're happy to hear that you've managed to find out what made the game too difficult. We've received your bug report and we're working on fixing it. Stay assured that The Wizards will get a lot of new content before leaving Early Access. For more details please visit this thread: http://bit.do/TheWizardsVR

When it comes to spells, we are planing a major Spell Update with new upgrades to every spell and redesign of mechanics that are currently not working perfectly well. 

Many thanks for your review and thorough feedback!"

Wish I had bought it on Steam so I could get a refund.","Oct 22, 2017 at 11:30 AM",1, 4,"Dear Absymarr, the full release of The Wizards introduced significant improvements to the gesture recognition system and highly improved graphics. You are invited to revisit our game to find out if your issues with controls got resolved, and to experience the complete game with it's new content (including bossfights with some gigantic creatures!)

Here is a quote from the review by The VR Grid: ""In the past half a year since I last reviewed The Wizards, it has not only improved, but it’s developed into a landmark adventure game that sets the standard for any future VR fantasy titles. Since August, nearly every flaw with this previously-mediocre game has been addressed. ""

Cheers!"
2022-05-28 15:11:59.181598,CoolHandFrank,Solid,"Its a neat single player story with fun vr mechanics built for vr.  Something lacking across the board.

5 stars are for a game that is fun to play, has good content, isnt a demo, and runs well with all the options you want for a vr game.  Its not a triple A game but vr just doesnt have many of those.  However we are certainly lacking games that are fun to play in vr with decent content.  This is that.","Aug 14, 2017 at 8:29 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 15:12:02.305242,BattleProgrammer,Kinda meh,"It's not too bad, but I don't find it particularly impressive or exciting. It seems to have less variety than Mage's Tale, less interesting environments, and a more restricted movement model.

I find the movement model considerably worse than the one in Mage's Tale. The fixed points limit freedom, and are quite disorienting in parts.

The gestures for magic are an interesting idea, but so far it's not very reliable.

The plot seems to be as basic as they go: move around and kill monsters.

Overall, it's playable, but I don't really see anything that Mage's Tale doesn't do better.","Aug 7, 2017 at 12:15 AM",3, 6,"Dear player, than you for this review. Please remember that the game is still on Early Access, what means we'll keep adding content for another ~5-6 months. We are also happy to share with you that our team is working on free movement and free teleportation update and it should be ready in a few weeks. Make sure to try the game again after the update. Thanks again!"

2022-05-28 15:12:02.338155,buellerdaman,"Seems fun, but way to glitchy","I really like the idea for this game, but  its too glitchy right now for me to want to play it. The spells rarely activate correctly, the movement of the frost bow is not smooth at all and really takes me out of the experience. If i could get a refund, I would do it until this game is a little more playable.","Aug 2, 2017 at 4:53 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:12:02.354112,subroutine,"Early Access, but still great","My first impression of the game was exactly what I was hoping for: a single player version of The Unspoken.  And that still sums up this game fairly well.
The game certainly has some issues with the controls, making some battles incredibly difficult. But this is something I'm willing to overlook, considering it is still in early access.  The levels are beautifully done, and the voice acting is superb.  The spellcasting motions feel fairly well-balanced in a difficulty-to-power sense (when the game reads your motions correctly).
Things I would love to see as the game develops further (again, not criticisms, but things that might add to the game as it comes out of early access):
-Non-hostile NPCs. Even just a specter of the wizard talking to you would be welcome, but the world feels too empty at times.
-More reactive environments. Many things can already be destroyed by fireballs and such, but other interactions would be fun too.  In one spot a group of goblins jumped out of a bush into a pond. Naturally my first instinct was to shoot lightning into the pond, but to no effect.
-Speaking of destroying environment objects, hidden areas! I noticed teleport spots don't respond if something is on top, such as debris (causing me to go in circles several times in the first mine level). I'd love to see bushes or barrels over teleport spots that can lead to extra areas in levels.
Bottom line, this game is a lot of fun, and shows tons of potential. If you're looking for a completely polished game, then you probably shouldn't be playing early access titles to begin with. Can't wait to see future iterations!","Aug 4, 2017 at 2:05 PM",5, 8,"Dear Subroutine,

Many thanks for a thorough feedback and many great suggestions! We'll do our best to address the problems you reported and to implement some of your ideas. Friendly NPCs sounds awesome. Deeper exploration is definitely welcome. Right now we're working on free movement and free teleportation update for The Wizards. We believe it will make exploration more immersive, but it will also call for richer locations. We'll definitely work on it during Early Access.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have some other ideas. You can reach us on official Discord server of The Wizards: https://discord.gg/BmfKczR"
2022-05-28 15:12:02.371067,Xyatsue01,Major ice bow glitch,"after about 3 hours of trying to get tohrough the first mission I just gave up. The ice bow will not aim correctly. when I try to shoot it jerks around uncontrolably and often wont even point straight (often shifts about 45 degrees to the left while jerking around uncontrolably). it also disappears after a few seconds (usualy right when an enemy is on top of me). also, there are a lot of times when the arrows wont appear. sometimes I have to reach several times before one appears. and lastly, after the bow disapears during battle I cant resummon it no matter what I do. Thats usually the cause of my death. Ive decided to stop playing until these issues are fixed. im also not a big fan of the mode of travel used in this game. I like to explore my environment. this game does not allow me to do that. I feel like Im playing on a leash. just following the designated path with no ability to fully experience my suroundings. hopefully this will all be fixed in a future update. otherwise, I wont be back.","Aug 6, 2017 at 4:20 AM",2, 1,"Dear Xyatsue, 

Many thanks for buying the game and reporting this bug. We are sorry for the technical problems you encountered. We'll investigate and fix this bug as soon as possible.
