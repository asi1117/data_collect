2022-05-28 17:03:44.705799,Dead_Romeo,"Love it, but needs more... Zazz!","Just a couple things really: Would be nice not to have to ""physically"" touch the menu buttons when navigating the selection window as it can be slightly wonky (the scroll bar is a tad too small and sensitive for those of us with big libraries), I feel like I have to lean forward and being able to point for focus and select with a trigger pull would work (or at least the option for something like that in addition to). A ""back"" button on the controller itself would also be most helpful! 

Otherwise, I'm aching to bring more visual flair to the audience viewing the monitor! Would be nice to have some more stage to choose from or be able to add our own stage elements like lights, (and fog, lasers, skulls, and pyrotechnics lol!), different colors for the DJ booth, some more camera angles that could auto-cycle, options for loading our own backdrops and looped videos to play behind the DJ and on the monitor. Could go even further and have some visualizations of some sort to switch the view to!

So far it all seems pretty solid, I'm excited to see what's next!","Sep 1, 2018 at 1:30 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 17:03:44.720759,CostanzaExperience,"Decent, but very basic.","Decent app and pretty much does do what's advertised, but not much else. I've been DJing for several years back in day and, needless to say, this is not the real deal. Controls don't always feel smooth. Timing is very important in DJing and here I found it hard to cue things up. Scratching doesn't feel good, either. But most important of all: this is VR, -- you can make just about anything, -- and this app went with the cheapest imaginable mixer (only low, mid, high and no effects, no sampler, etc). The decks are also stupidly simple. I want to have up to 4 decks with an assortment of super-advanced mixers to choice from, with a boat-load of FX, samplers and cue buttons. Plus, a range of MIDI controllers, a whole wall of a Monome-like matrix, an Akai-like drum kit, and just tons of buttons and faders. Maybe one day...","Apr 19, 2018 at 5:37 AM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 17:03:44.735719,vannagirl,Great but needs some modernising,"Very old school DJing for those using CDJ or controllers. Would love to see streamlined recordbox to select tracks then a super large in your face menu and in this day of djing, a BPM counter is pretty much expected. Other then this i love this app. I use vinyl decks also but this one has some slight advantages even without above mentioned. it is solid djing though, with some additions(as other reviews) it would be the best there possibly is.Great fun !!

Edit thats great updated score and look forward, just what this needs as icing.","Jun 26, 2018 at 12:15 AM",4, 1,Glad you are enjoying it! Look out for v1.2 being released this week as a free update. It includes BPM analysis and improvements to the UI with track artwork. I hope that helps! Phil
2022-05-28 17:03:44.749682,demotricus,Nice but would be even better with FX,"This is implemented beautifully and is an accurate representation of a basic Vinyl DJ set of decks & mixer, - all the expected  controls are present. Don`t expect any of the bells and whistles that you find in Serato or Traktor etc though, you have to do your stuff the old fashioned way here. You have a 3 band equalizer, a crossfade, deck speed controls, and cueing monitors and thats basically it. The controls are intuitive and easy to get used to.
The app would be enhanced if there were some basic effects included, maybe a filter, a reverb, an echo  or even a flanger/phaser?
As you mix, you can see a mirror image of yourself copying your actions in the background which is quite cool. It would be great if you could customise its look aka Deadmau5 or Daft Punk :)
All in all, an enjoyable app.","Jun 9, 2018 at 5:55 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:03:44.764642,maestropan,Better headphones would make this great!,"Really cool app, and very easy to understand and dive right in assuming any sort of dj experience. If you've never tried DJing before, maybe look up a tutorial on DJ mix basics because there is no explanation in this app. 

Everything just works and I've had a lot of fun messing around with mixes. Unfortunately, in order to cue the mix it seems you gotta hold the headphones up to your ear, which ties up a hand and only leaves you with one controller for the mix. If there was a way to toggle the cue headphones to your ear (simulate how DJ's hold the headphone with their shoulder) it would free up the second controller for the mix and make this app a lot better!!","Jun 4, 2018 at 8:01 AM",3, 1,"Hi, thanks for the feedback.

It sounds like you didn't get the latest update? v1.1 was released on 11th May and added the ability to attach the headphones to your head and cue in each ear using buttons on the mixer (see this video for an overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2a44-ZKNOA). Also in the help section of the app there are 6 videos that take you through the basics of DJing and how to use Reality Decks.

If you need any help getting the update just pop me a message at phil@realitydecks.com

Thanks,
Phil"
2022-05-28 17:03:47.900255,RecursiveConnectome,,"Works fine, on par or better than the competing VR applications.

At the time of writing still doesn't have 4 decks or MIDI-out support in luie of the the first. If one of the above were satisified, I could see this being used at a party/club.","May 13, 2018 at 12:27 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 17:03:47.915215,theregoes2,So Dang Close To Perfect That It Hurts,"I'm an old man now, but when I was 19 I used to attend these all night dance parties known as raves. Back then my dream for the future wasn't to become the fat, balding, homely man that I am now, but rather to become a skinny, balding, homely, rave DJ. I saved my pennies and bought myself a set of Numark Pro TT-1 turntables that cost me more than my entire Rift set-up, including PC. I never did get to be a DJ, not professionally anyway. But I played the crap out of those gee golly things. 
That was a long time ago, it seems. They were destroyed by a flood, gotta be gettin' on 15 years ago now. Haven't touched a turntable since. *tuns away. bites knuckle* 
This computer progrum was like having them back again... as ghosts... that were a littler harder to interact with on account of I couldn't actually touch them. They sounded so good, and they felt so close to how they ought! So dang close. DJing is such a tactile thing though, and this was not unlike like trying to do it with mitts on. 
I'm still going to practice. This is far and away a better program than I was expecting when I Ioaded it up. Maybe I'll try to set it up at a party sometime and live the old dream again. Just have to learn how to beat match again.

**5 stars because, even though it's not perfect, it's probably as close as we will ever get in this stage of VR. Though I'd be willing to pay cash money for a DJ controller that let me use my real hands to interact with this.","Feb 23, 2018 at 10:31 AM",5, 62,

2022-05-28 17:03:47.946132,OLD-RED,One day I might not come back!,"I have virtually everything.... A spaceship a racing car and now a pair of record decks that are truly amazing, and my record collection is inside my computer, so no more sleeves everywhere after a mix. I can't fault this program, if you have ever owned decks and you now have Oculus Rift this is an absolute must buy!","Apr 13, 2018 at 4:05 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:03:47.961092,shakapopolous,Fantastic!,"I am in no way a DJ. I just like to fiddle around with music from time to time. This was amazing though! I've never used a deck before but I figured everything out crazily quickly for intimidating it was in front of me.

2022-05-28 17:03:51.082743,troy_ch,Almost perfect,"I love almost everything about this! And I was lucky enough to test this while it was still in beta.


It's a great throw back in time, I was DJ'ing since I was 16, now I'm old and don't have space for all the equipment anymore. But it is so much fun visiting back some old records and mixing for an hour or two on weekends.


What I'm missing is different sound outputs so I can also stream to my friends if I feel like it. And maybe the abillity to add some more pitch in both directions. A search function to look for that one song burried in some subfolder you can't remember would be really nice too!


If you used to/or still are into the DJ culture this is a no brainer really, buy it and have fun!","Mar 9, 2018 at 7:43 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 17:03:51.097703,FastLawyer,Slightly better than Vinyl Reality,"So this app is not the first of its kind.  Vinyl Reality stepped unto the scene awhile back ago on steam.  They are awfully similar.  The key difference is that this app has lessons tracks that you can learn from.  I think that makes all the difference in the world.  You're really learning to be a DJ.  These are transferable skills to a real world application.  I'm not sure which app will end up being the better one a year from now, but for right now, it's this one.","Mar 3, 2018 at 12:30 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:03:51.112663,Fab0302,Put that record on,"This is awesome! I was thinking of buying me some old technics or numarks and mix my old trance records again. But this is much cheaper! Downloaded all my old records, I am back 30 years!
Now a little bit of criticism...
The touch controls don't always work properly. Several times I tried to slow the record manually but touched the on/off button (right side), switching headphone sides is always a challenge and navigating the menu and selecting records is sometimes difficult. Instead of point and click you have to grab them. The better DJ's are always busy and really every second counts. Therefore pressing the wrong button is lethal. 
But the main issue for me is how the headphones work. When I mix 2 records I need both hands to mix and sometimes pitch them together. I don't know how to put the headphones on my head (for one ear) so I have both hands free. Now I mix with one hand or without headphones on my head. Not how it should be.
Then there is this problem when playing for friends or family. When you are mixing your set the audience shouldn't be able to hear the headphones. Unfortunately that's not the case here. I don't know how to configure this, to only hear the headphones in my oculus and the rest over my speakers. I looked in settings but there is literally nothing there.
One more thing...changing the height of the table would be nice, this is giving me backache.
I am really hoping for updates, please devs, don't abandon this.
So...would I recommend this...Hell yeah!!!
This is really almost as good as the real thing and much, much cheaper. This might even be the future of mixing.","Mar 1, 2018 at 12:52 AM",4, 5,"The detailed feedback is really helpful, thank you. Rest assured we're only getting started - expect updates!"
2022-05-28 17:03:51.127623,pwnward,awesome begining to great software,"I was not expecting this much , I was really immersed and was able to lose myself in my music , standing or sitting . There are alot of things they need to work on but I really would wish I had the choice to add a virtual DJ concert or options to change the backgrounds :) hint hint ;)","Feb 24, 2018 at 4:39 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:03:54.230325,thebigbeatmanifesto,So great!,"I have already dumped a ton of time into this app.  It feels so genuine. Hopefully, there will be some added features (bpm tracker?)/ effects (filters, stutters, sampling) / different environments eventually but right now, I'm in love.
Today, discovered you can record the mix you're working on then when it's done, grab it and throw it on the deck!  SO awesome!
Some of the sensitvity on the hand on record could be improved, I often just want to hold the record to get ready to throw it in and when i lift my hand, it pushes it forward or backwards a bit. Also, it would be nice to remove the RIFT and pass it off to my buddy without the beat pausing but I know that's more of an Oculus thing than the app.
When I get some more time in, I'll make notes and update my review but man, i'm hooked and can't wait to get to the next mix! Thank you for this!  I tried Vinyl Reality and this thing smokes it.","Mar 1, 2018 at 2:27 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:03:54.246282,tom-tribexr,well built but tricky UI,"good start. found the interfaces and UI tricky to master, after spending a while trying to get my head around it. Main issues seem to be sensitivity of controls and depth gaugin. I really struggled to interact with the screen menu, and often grabbed rather than nudged controls. some refinement needed but promising start.","Feb 28, 2018 at 7:18 AM",2, 1,"Thanks for the feedback.

I've put this video together showing how the UI should work/feel. If its not what you experienced I'd really appreciate if you could let me know (or mail at support@realitydecks.com) so I can check whether this is some form of bug:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ijrM2A9SEo

I have seen a situation where some setups have the rift quite near to the sensors. Your hands can work fine on the decks but when you extend your arm to operate the menu it goes out of range causing all kinds of strange behaviour. This can be fixed by standing further away from the sensors and recentering in the Oculus menu.

It's also quite 'index finger' based, i.e. it can help to extend your index finger for selecting items and no buttons on the controller are used to operate the menu.

But appreciate it may be none of this and we need to work on the design, either way we're on it!"
2022-05-28 17:03:54.260244,RandyMagnum007,Fantastic!,"As a retired DJ of the old days, before CDJs, we had turn-tables. This reminds me of those days. Even only after a few minutes of play, it all felt really great. No fancy effects on the mixer, just two turn tables, a two channel mixer with eq pots, and you. Love it!","Feb 25, 2018 at 10:23 AM",5, 5,

Kept everything pretty simple, just very refined , old school and incredibly difficult to master. I'm not sure how much it would cost me to buy decks etc but this is an unbelievably accesible entry into a fun Dj'ing experience for a minimal amount of bucks.
