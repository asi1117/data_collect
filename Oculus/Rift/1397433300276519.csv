If you clench your jaws and stick the ride out, they flip you around so you have really no option but to crash.
Could be higher rated if you could slow it down a bit, but as is you really have to focus on not crashing rather than shooting cut and paste zombie figures.","Sep 12, 2020 at 3:20 AM",2, 2,

join the discord if you wanna compete with me https://discord.gg/nQyHMN4Yjw
 you use your head to aim and use your finger to shoot towards where u aim, its quite simple mechanism if yu going side to side or over clocking ! this means  u ruining your VR and computer by running  too memory on ur VR game and also might mean that your hardwar needs a reset , recalibation, or something.
u dont need to use anything other then ur head and the trigger , yu can us telekenisis but u must first start using your oculus control

2022-05-28 19:40:01.656909,dallincurt,Cancer,"I can't even shoot anything, the graphics are HORRIBLE and it's bascially a waste of megabytes, 1 star for being free","Dec 24, 2017 at 5:23 AM",1, 10,
2022-05-28 19:40:01.671869,nightcat.mau,Laughingly Bad,"Get ready for some good old whiplash as you use your mouse to shoot and your head to steer. Game moves so fast it's silly. Except for the giant zombies, which if you manage to hit them enough times, fall over slowly. Could be a half decent game if crashing into a building wasn't instant death.","Sep 10, 2017 at 1:59 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:40:04.755745,neuro27,VR Poison - Stay Away!!,"The developer, Program-Ace, is based in Ukraine and promises R&D and innovation on their website. However, this game supposedly published by them, is not featured on their website even under the VR section. It's no wonder, because nobody would want to be associated with this flaming garbage pile. I would never think about contracting Program-Ace for a project after seeing what a god awful puke festival they have publicly displayed. If I could give negative stars, I certainly would. I'm actually shocked this got past editorial review. I mean if any living, breathing human being were to allow this audio/visual assault on their consciousness, I'm sure they would have had to question their life path (after recovering from an hour spent next to the toilet). Shame on Oculus for allowing this to exist on their store.","Nov 1, 2017 at 9:09 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 19:40:04.771702,Mac2mnster,How to Shoot,"After reading the requirement stuff on here, I noticed it said Keyboard+mouse. I haven't tested the keyboard, but the mouse button fires the guns. Luckily my mouse cord was long enough, but still issues with looking right or left but i'm turning the opposite direction.","May 7, 2017 at 4:42 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:40:04.786662,jasonhc73,Ummmm,"There is no way to shoot. I have literally 6 different triggers to shoot, and none of them do anything. So if you want to experience a caotic hyper fast nausia inducing game, this is it. All it does is run rediculously fast through a never ending giant city with no traffic, no roads, really nothing but a grid system on the ground and absurdly tall zombies with no way to shoot them. There is no way possible that Program-Ace released this.","Mar 15, 2017 at 11:32 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:40:04.801622,Shon_t,No way to shoot,"Bad clone of Poly Runner VR...and that is a two star game at best. If you could actual shoot the zombies, pick up special weapons, etc...you might have a better game.","Mar 17, 2017 at 12:54 AM",1, 0,
