Well, with this game, I was simply blown away.  The graphics are some of the best I've seen in VR.  The lighting is phenomenal, and the atmosphere is great.  It very much scratches that ""Resident Evil 7"" itch, and looks far, far, far better in VR, than Res 7 does on PSVR.  This is also the first VR horror game that made me completely ""nope"" out.  I literally tossed off my headset. 

Also, the game is very well optimized.  Running on a RTX 2070 (regular, not super) I never encountered a single stutter or dropped frame.  Excellent work, hope to see more from this studio soon.  Their next game will be a day-one purchase for me.","Nov 23, 2020 at 9:59 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:09:30.765967,StretchyCM,Short and easy but also pretty creepy,"Very short game (approx. 1 hour) with a couple of well-made jumpscares. The puzzles are extremely simple, which is why you could call the game a scary exploration of a dilapidated house rather than an adventure game. But if you like a scary atmosphere or want to test whether you can endure something like that, it should really be worth considering buying the game as long as the price is a maximum of 10 euros!","Nov 1, 2020 at 8:57 PM",3, 5,
