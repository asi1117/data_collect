2022-05-28 15:38:34.694172,h.coffins,Cute game but...,"I really enjoy the game. It's cute, it's fun, and it's challenging. My gripe comes with a couple of bugs. The tutorial section has a green scroll that I'm assuming is supposed to tell me how to play the game, but it is completely blank. Also, when I play any of the modes - including the tutorial - the screen will go black and just hang on a black screen while music is playing. So it has a few bugs it needs to work out, but it is a fun, cute game that is worth the buy.","Aug 8, 2020 at 11:53 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 15:38:34.709132,Peaceteddie,Don't know what happened,"I can't pause the game or open a menu when I've started, floor is too low and it just doesn't feel intuitive.","Aug 28, 2020 at 5:22 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 15:38:34.724092,Maura1129,Could be so fun...,There are issues with space that make it impossible to play without the guardian popping up constantly.  My biggest issue was the clumsiness of the hand/chopsticks.  I normally love these types of games but I will just take the loss on this one because aggravating should not be an adjective I use when describing something I enjoy.,"Dec 14, 2019 at 2:19 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 15:38:34.753015,Shoomu,Intense and responsive!,Super fun for a few dollars. It does require more space than you think and will make you sweat! The gameplay is buttery smooth and mechanics are so addictive! great short fun!!,"Oct 15, 2019 at 12:03 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:38:37.860703,TurboThrill,Hectic and Cathartic,"I love these Counter Fight games. They're as simple as an arcadey game can be, but it's the responsiveness and fun style that'll keep you coming.

Of all the Rift games, this is the one I REALLY wish was available on the Quest. Do it and I'll double dip, devs.","Aug 14, 2019 at 6:26 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:38:37.875663,jaimek,"Enjoyable Experience, wish it was slower","The graphics are charming, the music is good and I enjoy the mechanics.  I just wish the intensity didn't ramp up so quickly.  Would be nice if there was a 'laid back' mode that lets you take as long as you want to complete the orders.","Jun 6, 2019 at 9:55 PM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 15:38:37.903589,Nonebetter,Super fun and a workout,"Sweat your tookus off making ramen and grinding those leaderboards.
I have so much fun playing these games, well worth the price.","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:00 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:38:37.918548,Tewchainz,Great game!,"Very easy to learn and simple. One thing I hope would change is that your right hand is ALWAYS using chopsticks, it would make sense to use my RIGHT hand to be able to open the fridge and get beer. (unless there is a way?)","Sep 2, 2018 at 10:08 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:38:41.039201,AutumnPioneer,Really great!,"This game makes you move around like crazy! I feel that this one is just a bit too difficult (especially with the robots), but its still lots of fun! I think i prefer the samurai chef edition of this game but this one is a blast too. Best to pick up both of these games as they are must haves!!!","Jun 25, 2018 at 5:00 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:38:41.054162,zitzy2000,"Fun little game, has me hooked!","Wow, never thought something like this would have me sweating and keep going back for more. The endless mode is great, the 5 minute mode is kinda ok. Wish you could make more bowls  and a bigger counter so you can do multiple dishes at the same time. Loved this game, will be playing again very soon.","Jun 23, 2018 at 11:56 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:38:41.068124,TGSML,eh,"i can't play it properly. frankly not everyone is blessed with the space to walk around. it even has teleport controls out side of levels

i can also see a few problems, why is the handle to the fridge away from the counter? just flipping it over would have solved so many problems","May 27, 2018 at 9:46 PM",2, 5,

2022-05-28 15:38:41.098044,onceinAwhile,"Fun little game, but not too many modes","The game is fun; much faster than something like job simulator. Fundamentally it is a transposition in VR of your average mobile game where you have to complete task in time.

The positive is that it is fun; you push yourself to go fast and complete as many customers in time; although sometimes the picture is not exactly clear about what they want; and would love to have a written description of what they order, on top of the picture.

The interaction is fine; decently precise and works most of the time; although the game has a big issue which is the fact that your hands are ""specialized"". So one hand is to grab (like the spoon for the soup, the bottle for the beer and so on), the other can just use chopsticks actions, like grabbing potsticker, seaweed and so on. would be better if you could use whatever hand you want; and grab the chopsticks when you need to pick things that require a chopstick.

I find myself stuck at times when using one hand, since the fridge is close to your right side; so make sense to use your right hand to open it and put in the beer, but you can't do that so you are forced to use your left hand.

Beside the controls, the other issue is game modes: there is one that is time based, so 5 min and you get score based on how many customers you serve, and the other is infinite time, until you fail 5 customers.
The game would benefit from different scenarios, like rush hour time, evening, party mode where you get a big delegation and so on. Something like overcook; with a ""story"" mode would be fun to have; so you get rated based on what you do and how well you do it, rather than just rushing with the 2 standard game modes.

It is very kids friendly; and the look is funny enough to overlook the fact that the game is pretty much like all the other games where you ""cook"" something; but being cheap it is totally worth your money. 

Looking forward to a more ""serious"" restaurant simulation from these developers; with some more deep mechanics","Jan 21, 2018 at 3:36 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:38:44.177807,Alucardmi,Fun short game,Definitely a fun game for the price while on sale. The option to swap hands with the chop sticks would be nice or at least be able to open and close the fridge with that hand and a casual endless/unlimited practice mode (no angry customers or unlimited lives) would be great.,"Dec 31, 2017 at 7:27 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:38:44.191769,FastLawyer,Too realistic,Shouldn't I get paid minimum wage for playing this game?  Serious question because I honestly think there's like a robot somewhere in Japan filling orders based on my play.  This is the future.  Think about that and despair.,"Oct 8, 2017 at 3:21 PM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 15:38:44.206729,StangGT325,Definitively Japanese,"Great game and well executed for a VR game. The culture in Japan differs greatly from home. I could see this game being a hot seller in Japan. Physics are on point, and the cheerleader is hilarious. It's definitely a workout and will make you sweat within a 5-minute game. The potstickers are awkward to deal with, but overall a really fun game.","Nov 6, 2017 at 12:14 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:38:44.221690,air805ronin,,"A fun game that can get your heart rate up.  On endless challenge I am still at the point where I'm only lasting about 15 minutes.  How long you last in that mode is really up to the whims of randomness.  The ramen dishes are much quicker to prepare than the gyduon in the Samurai edition, and that is offset by the potstickers (gyoza) being kind of a pain.  Also, the worst thing about the game is the weird fridge placement!  It should open in the other direction, and would if it were my kitchen.  Aside from that, the game is a blast to play and I enjoy crawling up the leaderboards as I get better at it.","Nov 6, 2017 at 1:18 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:38:44.235652,aktse,Could be better,"I can see this being really fun and even addictive to play, but the controls don't seem to be very good (brief stalls constantly) and, as others have said, the fridge is awkward and essentially slows you down.  Make some improvements and perhaps some new menu items as you play more!","Nov 7, 2017 at 5:19 AM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 15:38:47.372263,tOBdavian,"Little bit Job Sim, little bit Overcookd","This game is super fun. The mechanics are relativly simple and my family had a great time playing and watching each other play. I pick it up every now and they for a workout or a laugh. Fun pace that quickly gets hektic!

I only wish there were options to slow things down a little to have a slightly longer game. Other than that. Fun fun fast paced game.","Oct 9, 2017 at 5:07 PM",4, 1,

It would be great to see a story mode or something of more substance from the developer in a sequel :)","Oct 1, 2017 at 2:19 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:38:50.546772,Lt.Loony,,"For its cost it is definately a solid buy. Makes for a nice excersize and fun to show your friends and see them panic when they start falling behind.
There is no real progression, but cant complain too much there with this pricetag","May 24, 2017 at 2:41 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:38:50.562729,doublehead,Really fun simulator,"As silly as this game is, I really get that feeling from being rushed that I did working in a 5 star hotel. I mean, no where near the complexity, but that same ""oh crap, time to move fast"" feeling. Fortunately I never had to throw bottles at theives, but I probably wanted to throw them at some of the customers, and you can do that here too! HA!","May 4, 2017 at 9:58 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:38:53.656455,waful,Fun but repetitive,"It's a fun way to trick yourself into doing cardio. But there is no sense of progression - there are no new foods to unlock and it's always the equivalent of an ""endless"" mode. Also, the fridge needs to open from the left side instead of the right side because the hand is on the left and the chopsticks are on the right.

If they added a leisure/zen mode that would be really cool.","Feb 9, 2017 at 3:50 PM",4, 5,
