2022-05-28 18:54:38.593575,Thirroxin,,"I really enjoyed this game. FNAF was an alrightish game so I was skeptic at first, but this one is completely different since it's in VR. This game honestly scares me even today (while knowing what to do and when), and it's always a pleasure to watch friends or family attempt when they visit. Great game when playing myself, even better when watching others try.","Dec 28, 2016 at 5:20 PM",5, 6,
