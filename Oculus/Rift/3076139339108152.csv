2022-05-28 20:31:12.364789,krisvdvijver,loved it,"This game is clearly made by creatives who wanted to tell a visual story, and I love the result. A story-driven 'game noir' with funny lines, good voice-acting, all the known 50s detective cliches, but just a little bit different by applying them on robots living and working in a futuristic city. If you don't rush, the game -a mix of cinematic cut-scenes and click-and-point interaction- will take about an hour to finish. If you like stories with voice acting, cartoony graphics, robots and comedy, then I can definitely recommend this short, sweet and funny game.",Nov 27 at 8:43 AM,5, 2,

VR needs more interactive stories like this!",Oct 29 at 7:00 PM,5, 2,

The game is an hour long, two at max. At first the gameplay seems pretty much linear, meaning despite the many point-and-click choices presented across the play, those do not allow much freedom of exploration, as in ""you must do this and then that in order to advance"", nothing you do beside the correct choices really matter... However, in this particular and spectacular game, that's actually works in favor of the game's storyline- I'd say this game is more of an interactive VR Film rather than a fully fledged gameplay-based VR experience, and that's why I love it so much- the story is fleshed out, it's fun, witty and executes the VR cinematography tools cleverly, it's a story of respect and homage to it's precedor- the cinema. It's a refreshing story-based experience that seems rare, too rare, in the general VR scene.
Visually, the game's visuals are like a candybar, i'm left with a yummy feeling and a hunger for more.
Definitely waiting for the sequel!

tl;dr:
Story - 5/5
Gameplay mechanics - 3.5/5
Visuals - 4.5/5
Time to finish - about an hour or two
Final verdict: instead of going to some movie in your local cinema, spend your time in a fun story-based game well worth your time!",Jul 27 at 11:26 PM,5, 7,

My Initial Impressions:
A short but very sweet 'Point and Click adventure, that is a rare genre for a VR title.",Jul 23 at 3:29 AM,5, 6,
