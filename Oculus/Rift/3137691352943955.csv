The Good: You can teleport and turn around in the home area. You get an aerial view of each location. The photography is pretty good and it's free. It feels like the start of something bigger where you could use those nifty teleport controls in each location to explore the city. 

The Bad: There is an annoying logo in your field of view in every city, and big blue dots to take you to other cities cluttering the view. You can’t move outside of the home area, even though the description implies you can, and there really isn't much to do with a static image. 

Usually 360 lets you stand in the center and enjoy the wraparound view, but looking straight down could be done just as well in pancake. My suggestions: get rid of that annoying logo and blue dots unless they let the player teleport to new areas within the current city.

Allow teleportation on the city map. Have a toggle for sound, add in ambient music. There's zero information in this, so change the description to something more honest or add in a factoids area.","Oct 17, 2020 at 2:56 AM",1, 13,
2022-05-28 20:29:55.495044,Kifzervan,Problems,"No menu. No option to turn with controller, you have to physically turn your head. (Cable makes this odd especially when seated.) No volume options so ambirent sounds cant be toggled on or off. Only a single 3D space per area so not much replay value once youve seen all the areas available. Limited selection of places to go. Not sure if this is the full product or a Beta that was accidentally released early.","Oct 13, 2020 at 2:27 AM",2, 13,
2022-05-28 20:29:55.510004,TazOfOld,,"It looks great, but when at a location I could find no way to move other than turn my head.  Is there some secret way to zoom in and move around? The Google Earth 3D app has all that. I don't see anything that this app does that isn't done better via Google Earth.  As others have noted, this app seems to be a waste of time. 

However, at the aerialsphere website, in regular internet 2D, you can move and zoom via the mouse. Even so, it isn't nearly as useful as Google Earth.  Again, I see no reason for it via the internet or via Oculus VR.","Nov 14, 2020 at 5:23 AM",1, 2,
