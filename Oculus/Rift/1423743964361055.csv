2022-05-28 19:41:56.484121,MShimura,Terrible Thailand VR Experience,"Unplayable at some parts. Couldn't bend down to plant the rice since it was below the floor. Couldn't move or do anything after selecting my fabric clothing. The only good thing was the 360 video, however the 360 photos shouldn't have been included.","Sep 16, 2020 at 3:12 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:41:56.501582,Etzian,Not Well Optimized,"The game has potential but currently unplayable, mostly due to uncomfortable frame rate. FPS is low despite of minimum assets and interaction and I got VR sickness from it. Tested in 1060 6GB.","Jan 8, 2019 at 11:54 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:41:56.518536,nightcat.mau,Terrible,"After choosing the theater experience I kept being given no choice but more and more sub menus. To finally arrive at a blurry mess of a video in which I was traveling backwards in a jerky motion while being shook up and down and side to side. Trying to turn didn’t help and the video quality was so bad it seemed purposeful. I actually got VR sick and that almost never happens. I appreciate they want us to experience Thailand, but the blurry place I saw could have been anywhere.","Jul 9, 2018 at 2:30 AM",1, 6,
