Once you get some upgrades, buy a faster vehicle, it gets interesting. However, the 3D visuals aren't great, whether 1st person view or 3rd person view. The gameplay is just okay for me. It is just mediocre all around. Good deal at .99 cents if you can find it at that price.","Jun 14, 2020 at 3:35 AM",3, 2,

The right pad stears along with the A button to jump which means you have to move your thumb back and forth between controls causing you to hit the obstacles.  And you have to put the gamepad down and pick up the touch controller to navigate the menus. Why not use the one touch controller with trigger to jump, grip to speed up, and pad to stear?","May 31, 2019 at 4:23 AM",1, 4,

Cool futuristic sounding techno (well, one song had some odd parts in it; hey, I'm a musician!) and fun levels! Got to level 2 to find it was inside a building! And yes, it is a little frustrating at times using th etouch controller joysticks, what's cool is you can use either hand whenever you want. Still, switching between the three different modes (first and third person, and a close up) was neat, sometimes I ""click the stick"" just to see different views. Colorful and quite fun, and aside from the occasional pushing down on the joystick, the controls are VERY responsive to left and right movement. You can even control the speed! Hammer on the speed and press the jump button as soon as you leave a ramp and you'll probably find yourself driving on the ""roof"" of the playing field! An absolute GEM of a game that is a steal at the current sale price of $1.99... Man, you can't go wrong!!","Feb 8, 2019 at 12:37 PM",4, 3,

It's annoying when your controller wont respond to turn right or left, or when you accidentally switch from 1st to 3rd person view. But the biggest moment is when you die and have to start all over, there is no real motivation or feeling of accomplishment at all, it needs a checkpoint. But the game is super cool to run in 1st person view, kinda trippy...","Oct 28, 2018 at 3:35 AM",4, 3,
