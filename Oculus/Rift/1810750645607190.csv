2022-05-28 19:11:26.927642,cqt_,Cats CATS CCCCAAATTS!,"I love cats so this is a amazing experience for me! I'll recomend it my mom and her friend like it too. If your a cat lover i recommend this! 
(BTW if you hold your ""hands"" out in front of you below a kitten you can catch it and its adorable!)","Jan 1, 2018 at 9:34 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:11:30.076221,drash,Uniquely entertaining,"This is a quick and entertaining experience that may work as a demo to your friends.  Personally thought it was worth it just for the avatar mirror in the beginning!  The music itself isn't particularly amazing for me, but the experience still compelled me to smile and participate.  Nicely done!","Aug 18, 2017 at 11:30 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:11:30.091181,FastLawyer,Fails to capture magic of Old Friend,"Anyone who purchases this will be reminded of Old Friend VR.  However, that game came together to bring a unique experience.  The song, the graphics, the attitude all came together to make a magical experience.  This title, unfortunately, does not capture that same magic.  The music is forgettable.  I have played it twice and still couldn't hum the beat.  The visuals are nice and trippy, especially if you love cats.  The problem is that unlike Old Friend, there's nobody that you want to mimick dancing (the tribespeople don't really dance in a memorable way).  You can see your limbs flail about and you can ""shoot"" cats (you don't control the shooting) and shoot some very small air bubbles (very pathetic attempt at shockwaves!).  Overall, it's okay and it runs smoothly.  Maybe others will enjoy more, but I won't play it a 3rd time.","Aug 18, 2017 at 9:08 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:11:30.106141,LegoKnockingShop,It's fine...,"It's colourful and jolly enough but it's entirely uninteractive (you fire kittens but they don't affect anything), it quickly repeats all it's content within the song, and you'll probably only run it once. It's fine though and worth the low price. Probably my least favourite of the developer's demos.","Sep 8, 2017 at 8:10 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:30.121101,ishotjr,Giraffage x Nyan Cat x VR,"As a Giraffage fan I couldn't wait to see what on earth this crazy-looking thing was all about.  It's a short experience, but I couldn't stop giggling throughout, it was so whimsical and charming and fun.  Trying to figure out the ""point"" is like dissecting Nyan Cat - the only point is that it's hilariously awesome and you should just relax and enjoy it.  I would love to see more VR ""snacks"" like this - I'd gladly buy one every week just to experience someone's unique take on how VR can be used beyond the more obvious/traditional applications! :D","Aug 19, 2017 at 7:51 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:11:30.136061,Anticleric,Fantastical,"Tyler Hurd is a VR genius. His experiences are beautiful, clean, polished, and mezmerizing. This, BUTTS, and Old Friend are gaurenteed to put a smile on the face of anyone who dons the HMD. Some of my favorite things.","Aug 23, 2017 at 2:59 PM",5, 2,

You understand my mercy about this short coloured installation?","Aug 19, 2017 at 3:24 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:33.263696,mrmojoman0,an experience.,i would buy two hundred of these if they existed. some of the most joy i've had from my VR is shooting kittens out of my hands while jamming to some nice tunes.,"Sep 3, 2017 at 2:11 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:11:33.292618,patrickpilon,Ok...,"Interesting, more like a demo than a performance to me... I think it should be free.","Aug 27, 2017 at 3:55 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:36.374376,nickladd,Whacky and Surreal,Great weird little thing. But I feel like I'll be showing it less to newcomers to Vr than old friend or even butts.,"Aug 19, 2017 at 6:39 AM",5, 0,
