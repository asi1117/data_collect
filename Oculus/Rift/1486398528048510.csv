However, the force grab mechanism for moving the blocks is very difficult to use because it appears to provide no way of rotating them or moving them closer/farther. The basic design in which you're forced to move blocks around from in back of you to in front feels artificial and awkward (it'd be better if the action were mostly in front of you). The graphics are very basic and stylistically inconsistent (primitive shapes in what appears to be a realistic dungeon), and the tutorial text does little other than repeatedly mock your failure. The amount of content is also extremely limited. Needs work.","Oct 8, 2017 at 3:27 PM",1, 3,
