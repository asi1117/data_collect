2022-05-28 19:44:13.573830,Valver,I took a photo of a penguin (shrug),"This free experience lets you spend a few minutes in the snow being told about penguins and the challenges they are facing.  The IK of my hands and body was a bit weird.  Scanned some penguins, photographed a penguin.  Quit out never to return.  Not bad per se, just not compelling either.","Apr 12, 2018 at 4:58 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 19:44:13.589787,aleks_arias,Good job,"Nice work with the models and the content, the only problem is that after taking the picture of a penguin and hearing the explanation, nothing else happens, I don't know if that is the end of the experience or if it is a bug. Keep the good work. I will love more apps like this.","Apr 28, 2018 at 11:46 AM",4, 1,"Thank you for the feedback aleks_arias! Yes, that is the end of the Antarctica experience. We have updated the app so that it will take you back to the menu screen once completed.
Thanks"
