2022-05-28 15:39:38.492535,Hanover,A Fun Puzzle Game to Zone Out To,"This is a fun puzzle game to play when you just wanna take a break and escape for awhile.  It can be pretty challenging, but it has a gentle skill curve that teaches you as you play.  There are also some pretty cool elements, like being able to move between networks.  

It's also a nice game just to zone out to when you want to relax.  There are some exhilirating moments where you'll solve the level in the nick of time, but for the most part, the game becomes instinctual.","Apr 6, 2020 at 3:50 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 15:39:38.507495,D0relei,,"Like other ones said, ""just one more"", and you're still there an hour later, trying to hack every nodes, just for fun :) If you like logic (or brute force with all your viruses) and peaceful environment, this game is for you. Sure, VR doesn't bring much, but you're 'inside', and that's enough.","Aug 27, 2019 at 4:36 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:39:38.522454,diomark,I forgot how much fun this was! touchOK,"I used to play this on the gear vr years back, but hadn't thought much of it.. Just launched it accidentally on my rift. Wow, I forgot how much fun this game was. works perfectly with Touch btw as of May 2019.","May 5, 2019 at 5:52 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:39:38.536417,Zennor,This seems to be broken  with Touch,"With my controller plugged in as well as Touch this version is not playable. Please expedite a fix so i dont have to by the Steam version recently rolled out for Vive as well.

Edit : Yes touch suport added . Shame I can't just delete my review :)","Jan 22, 2019 at 3:03 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 15:39:38.551377,mesab66,Fantastic puzzler experience,"Love this game, hugely immersive.  I purchased this a while ago and still play it often.

Developers:   are you working/planning on a follow up ?","Nov 18, 2018 at 7:09 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:41.679012,rsiggy,Touch controllers don't work well,"No idea if this is a good game or not because the control interface is so terrible.  After each move you need to press the ""back"" button (A or X) but it amost never works.  Player ends up pressing random buttons for a minute and hope it takes so you can make your next move.  Might be a decent game if they fix this but who knows.","Jan 29, 2019 at 12:25 PM",1, 0,

2022-05-28 15:39:41.707935,FastLawyer,VR adds nothing should be $3 mobile game,"My main problem with this game is that I think it's way overpriced for what you're getting. People here are claiming like the VR somehow added anything to this game. I honestly would prefer to play this game on my mobile phone. I would probably give it 5 stars if it cost $3 there. However as a VR game it's not that immersive. I'm pointing and clicking on my Oculus remote. It's not the worst game, but you really need to love logic puzzles game to enjoy this game. Don't fall for all the glowing reviews, if you don't like puzzle/logic games in general, then this game will not be the game that makes you like them. And if you do love logic/puzzles game, can somebody answer me why it's so expensive and why this game wouldn't be better played on my mobile phone?","Mar 31, 2018 at 12:37 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:39:41.722894,GregTampa,lied about supporting touch,"DOES NOT SUPPORT TOUCH controllers, you need a gamepad to play this.
was very excited to play, then found out i couldnt, untill i buy a controller.
I might change this depending how good it is when i buy a controller.","Dec 19, 2017 at 1:09 PM",1, 12,Hi! Just wanted to let you know that Darknet was just updated to add Touch support. You're good to go!
2022-05-28 15:39:41.739850,tig3rmast3r,LOVE IT!,"but please add touch support, i got from oculus because it was on sale, i would like to use my vive wands like the steam version, thanks!","Jan 15, 2018 at 9:35 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:39:44.861500,thebriarfox,Hollywood Hacking,"Do you think 2d cyberspace is lame? Is poking at systems to get in cooler than having to actually crack them? Is Johnny Mnemonic the greatest computer movie ever? Then chummer, have I got a deal for you...

Beautiful visuals and an elegant point and click interface help make this challenging but not brutal area control puzzle game a real treat. Ever wanted to play the VR version of Tron, Hackers, or The Lawnmower Man? Here it is, bub. Hack systems, solve puzzles, steal cash, buy sweet viruses, take on jobs, hack more systems, realize it's 4 in the morning and you should probably quit after one more system....

A singular VR experience not to be missed.","Aug 1, 2017 at 8:34 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:44.877457,zDisturbed1,Amazing game,I got this on the gear vr back in the day and so I had to get it on the full rift too. Did not realise I never left a review. Very fun simple to learn difficult to mastert puzzle game in a cyber hacking wrapper.,"Aug 11, 2017 at 5:20 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:39:44.891420,FrancKaos,Love this game!,"Does one job and does it well! Can't wait to see what this guy does next. One complaint (which doesn't detract from the gameplay), the animations could do with being slight longer, esp 'data aquired' reward anim. My only 5 star review!","Jun 24, 2017 at 4:21 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:39:44.906380,shadinio,Ahh...my eyes!,"This game (or I should rather say, disease) is SO well designed and executed! I've gone blind after playing this for far too long in single sittings! :p","Jul 4, 2017 at 6:38 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:39:44.920342,edgeofblade,The Game I Keep Coming Back To,"Darknet is easily my favorite game in VR. It's relaxing and simple to control, while offering immense depth and opprotunity for personal strategy. Don't underestimate the game from the first few levels. The game throws a large collection of twists at you as the game progresses, but I wouldn't want to spoil any of those here.

And check Reddit (r/darkcom) for help with the Data View, if you can't figure it out yourself.","Apr 16, 2017 at 11:07 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:48.016062,OoaliceoO,Prepare to loose Sleep...,"... over this addicting puzzle game, conveniently played with the remote. Once I stopped mindlessly clicking around and figured how the ""viruses"" work it became pretty easy. Isolate the blue dots you want to launch against the core so they don't bump into other blue dots and go for it. At least until skill level 50% then you need to watch out to not use money for the wrong things. To quickly load up with cash I am currently using an exploit to extend an unprotected area, or even better, connect two of them, and then the hydra.","Apr 12, 2017 at 1:56 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:39:48.058948,maxbolted,Harder than it looks.,"My personal favourite puzzle game. Not especially graphicaly impressive, but non the less, still a great game! tips for new players: use viruses to weaken anti-virus nodes and ""pick the right one"" to attack the core with.
The ""current news"" bits you can read from the main menu is a nice touch.","Dec 13, 2016 at 8:40 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:39:51.180599,jon,Abstract Hacking,"If I described this game as ""cell phone VR"" or simply as a ""puzzle game"", i'd be correct.  I'd be just as correct in describing it as ""fun"" and ""well worth the spend"" though, so give it a try (as long as it remains priced as cell phone VR).","Apr 11, 2017 at 10:58 AM",4, 0,
