2022-05-28 19:19:27.456400,RavenSwan,Consistency problems with scoring?,"Super fun puzzle game for parents and kids alike, but as we are a very competitive gaming household and physics nerds, it is frustrating that even when making the exact same shot multiple times (hitting the same ""zone"" of the towers beneath the red fuzzies) a vastly different score is achieved everytime.  We know, it's a game, games are meant to be fun etc., but we like to challenge ourselves to aim for the high scores, and in this game, scoring seems completely random.  Kiddos are frustrated, so are we.  Graphics, user interface, audio and mini game variety are all exceptional!  We downloaded this game because we dig playing Angry Birds as a family, so the scoring inconsistency is our only beef with it.","Nov 15, 2020 at 6:39 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:19:27.471360,GargamelSE,,"I agree with the other reviews. Its VERY hard to throw, either the furry balls goes straight to the floor, or shoots way over the target. With slingshot, it gets a bit easier.","Aug 27, 2020 at 2:46 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:19:27.487317,thejustchad,There is a lot I love and a lot that....,"There are a lot of things I really like about this game. It is very tatical, and NOT in any way ""easy"", like I first thought it might be.
That in and of it's self is a double edged sword, as it ""looks"" to be an easy laid back kids game. It's not. Also the tutorial type stuff is very easy to over look and sometimes hard to figure out what it is trying to tell you. 
The camera tutorial is a perfect example, after you finally figure out what all it wants you to do with the camera, and you think you are ready to get back to the game, You stand there looking at the game field wondering why the game hasn't started , then you turn around and see that it now wants to to click a frame that wasn't there a few seconds ago...
Dev go out and borrow a 10 yo kid that has never played the game, don't give him/her any hints and just take notes of the issues s/he runs into and fix em. Look for the frustration areas, fix em.

And of course as mentioned, add seperate saves/profiles.","Jun 12, 2019 at 10:27 AM",3, 5,"Thanks for taking the time to write this review. Be assured I take every review very seriously.

1) About the game being not easy: I did use the word ""challenging"" to describe the game in the short description of the game, although I'm not sure where this description appears in the store. There are things to do in the game for everyone though. Kids usually have a lot of fun simply messing around in the mini-games area or the Party mode.

2) About the Tutorial: They already come a long way, but yes there is still a lot of space to improve. I decided not to add text in there to be able to translate the game in a maximum of languages (15 at the moment). The Tutorial Furball is always pointing at where things need to be done, but somehow this pointer does not draw enough attention. I'll try to work on that in the upcoming updates.

3) About playtesting: I did have a lot of test users who I observed going through the game. Non-gamer adults are actually the most struggling subjects (kids usually pick things up quicker). Anyway, I should have some more apparently. There are never enough :)

4) Seperate saves/profiles: I uploaded the latest version with this feature a few minutes ago (along with a lot more improvements). Please update the game to get them. Here is the roadmap for the game: https://trello.com/b/Igk45fOo/vr-furballs-demolition

2022-05-28 19:19:27.502277,evilStimpVR,Perfect quick pick up n play game!,"This game has a surprisingly high level of AAA polish in terms of presentation, controls and sound. It has a great Nintendo vibe off it and is perfect for both quick gaming sessions as well as prolonged bouts where you try to get to the top of the world leaderboard (I managed to get 2nd place on one level, but then 56th place on another!).

It's certainly addictive. I settled in for a short session, and before I knew it the clock had struck 1:30am. Gah!","Feb 13, 2019 at 7:28 AM",5, 3,

My Quick Thoughts:
If you like the Official Angry Bird games, you're going to love this.
I found VR Furballs to have a lot more scope and variety than your standard Angry Birds. In VR Furballs you don't just have a slingshot, you have numerous devices like tennis rackets and even golf clubs.
Also the gameplay is a lot more tactical.
Awesome stuff!","Feb 13, 2019 at 2:05 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:19:30.636893,itschriscollins,"Plenty of content, plenty of fun!","This game really, really impressed me. The premise is simple (and should be obvious): fling small furballs into other furballs and scenery.

The furballs are adorable, and come in lotas of different colours with special abilities like destroying certain scenery elements or exploding; the scenery is all true physics and will merrily collapse when comprmoised, crushing the nasty red furballs in it's wake; you can throw them, you can slingshot them, hell you can bounce them up and down and brain them with a tennis racquet - it's insanely fun!

There are traditional 'worlds' for you to try and 3 star with 54 levels in total (I'd wager there's a good few hours here, before any replaying or bonus games) and a whole host of minigame modes - it's the perfect companion to a party. Between these, the minigames, and a level builder all of your own this is a game you can dip in and out of indefinitely. Sure it's not a big sprawling RPG but it does what it does well and will keep you entertained for many a session.

Graphics are big, simple, but punchy (and adorable), gameplay is smooth, sounds are bouncy but not obtrusive in the background with lovely furball screams and collapsing/exploding rubble in the fore. It's an absolute bargain in a sale but more than worth its regular asking price. (And a darned sight more content than a similarly themed competitor... squawk)","Feb 12, 2019 at 7:11 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:19:30.651853,MervinRae,"Entertaining, Cute & Eye Candy","Very entertaining and well made game with cute design and a ""full-game"" amount of content. If you like the premise then you can not go wrong with this game: it has great production value & is fun.","Feb 12, 2019 at 7:37 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:19:30.667810,jutjut1134,Its exactly what you think it is.,"This game is well made and has a nice cute feel. I buy alot of games to play with my son and this is going to be a big favorite for him. There stands some pretty simple issues though.

The lack of different save files seems grossly overlooked for a VR game, more so in this sudo cell phone style game thats clearly made with a younger audience in mind. Love to see that in the future.

Ive got a few other gripes but haven't spent enought time on it yet to really settle. As for now for the $10 I got this for I'm very pleased. Is a 29 year old hardcore gamer grabbing this to play by themself? Seriously? Yeah. Give it a go, sure it looks like a clone of that game that became a movie and a show and 3 other games, but to sit down for a change and just mindlessly toss stuff about and what now, awesome. Parents? Your kids will love it.","Dec 15, 2018 at 10:55 PM",4, 7,"Thanks for the comment jutjut1134!

UPDATE: The ""multiple profiles with different save files"" feature was released today. Please udpate the game and give it a shot!

The Christmas update of ""VR Furballs - Demolition"" is out. It brings some Christmas vibe to the game, and a brand new Party Mode. It's something you and your son will enjoy for sure. It was built with families in mind! Let me know what you think about it once you tried it.

Really happy one more hardcore gamer enjoyed the game. It's hard to make you guys believe this cute game can be for you. But actually it truly is for everyone ;)
