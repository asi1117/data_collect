The few musical instruments are too flat and simple, too ""rigid"" and cannot be configured or customized.  It is obvious that thinking about external plugins is impossible, so the entire experience in Lyra becomes too soon limitating for a creative or a musician or, sadly, a beginner.  The interface that allows us to play instruments is also too involute to easily perform even the simplest melodies.  The price  is already low but the problem is that, even so, there is no incentive to use Lyra. I think that VR could be a good medium for a new kind of music production. I have also some ideas about how could be a good virtual music application. But right now the lack of fingers and the absence of a fast and precise interaction with the virtual instruments is a big limit. I'm sorry for Lyra. I had big expectations because the comments here on Oculus store are all good.","Apr 15, 2020 at 3:53 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 16:44:19.672845,MrNobodyX3,Way better than expected!,"I thought it would something fun to play around with, make small beats, but it's very good at making full songs. If you get this besure to give it time. For me the longer I used it the more I loved it! I do hope for big updates, like more instruments, or controllers.","Oct 4, 2019 at 7:51 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:44:19.686808,Salem2077,Love it :),"Wonderful app very inuitive, even for someone who isn't a musician.  I love the fact that I can see the notes when I play them. 

I am having one problem however.  If I remove my headset the app goes into a very odd 2D mode that won't end and I'm forced to restart it.  

But besides that it is a lot of fun.","Sep 10, 2019 at 11:26 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:44:19.701768,Minimalistiker,Fun and innovative!,The first minutes can be a bit overwhelming but once you figured out the mechanics you will find in LyraVR a fun and new way to make music!,"Jan 27, 2019 at 8:24 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:44:19.715731,michelle.obj,Tracking gets lost - motion sick :(,"I wanted to like this! Was super excited and loved the concept but for some reason, the gyroscope seems to bug out if I remove the headset and put it back on, causing instant sickness (the screen freezes). I haven't been able to play this because of this bug but otherwise it would've been really interesting. It's not the most intuitive, as I am not really sure how to control time, but hopefully the devs are working on updates","Aug 12, 2018 at 12:57 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:44:22.843365,levi.kaus,Incredible experience,This is a masterpiece when it comes to music creation if you are  a visual person like me. I have always been keen on music (I was a drummer in high school) and this takes it to another level. The ability to drag and drop the controllers anywhere is a godsend instead of having to move a huge drum kit around haha. Technology is taking over every industry. This is no exception. Great work on this tool. One problem though. The app has crashed for me twice now. Not sure whats going on exactly. I hope you get it patched in a future update. Other than that it is a great experience.,"Mar 14, 2018 at 6:31 PM",4, 4,Thank you for the review!  We are sorry for the app crashing on your end. We try our best to resolve all bugs and crashes but it would help us if you can let us know how to reproduce the steps when it crashes for you. You can email us at: support@lyravr.com
2022-05-28 16:44:22.858325,Thiesen_f,,"Wtf... <20ms latency??? OMG... I tried to ""play"" the drumpads along with some of my MP3's and I couldn't notice any latency at all... good job on that one... but then I found out that the pads can be triggered both from the right side AND from the ""wrong"" side which was a little awkward since my motor skills isn't too good... I have a suggestion about how you can remedy that though... why not have a toggle in the settings that let's me choose from which way the pads gets triggered? Like ""Triggered from both sides"" or ""Triggered normally"" or ""Triggered from the bottom side""...

You know what... Sunvox... yeah... SOFTSYNTH... but the sounds you already have is quite impressive

5 stars on this one...","Jan 26, 2018 at 9:18 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:44:22.872288,migero_neko,"It's so amazing, waiting for updates","Oh wow, this game is incredible, i have so much fun.. You can create whatever you want.. The only minus is tutorial, because there is so much possibilites but it's hard to realize on you own how to do all the stuff.. Or if not the tutorial is the problem, i wish there was something like ""encyclopedia"" in the game when you have everything that you can actually do. Besides, the best game i have been playing so far, and worth to buy :) Thanks","Dec 25, 2017 at 7:08 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:44:22.887248,AffordableAgency,"Seems promising, need better tutorials","I love the concept. just playing round seemed fun, but i wish i had more intutitve ui and better tutorials. I think a pallete like interface like medium has would do wonders.","Apr 23, 2018 at 2:14 PM",4, 0,
