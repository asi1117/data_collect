2022-05-28 18:43:04.375360,Zimtok5,A Sonic Snack for VR Veterans,"With the bloodlines of Surge, Thumper, and Paper Beast resonating beside it, Synthesis Universe is an indie music experience that boasts great tonal depth and refinement in it's visual presentation that we don't often see presented at this level of polish.

Primarily a gaze-led experience, the project does feel a bit dated, but the love imbued by it's creator is felt throughout, here.  This nigh theatrical presentation pairs well with a SubPac (or similar tactile transducer laden device), so be ready for a 20-30 minute sonic adventure.

In summary, there is an artisan's attention given here, and the experience is an appetising taster for a world I hope we get to experience some years from now.","Sep 15, 2020 at 8:59 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:43:04.391317,Dukealicious,Indies breed creativity,"Synthesis Universe Episode 00 is an evolutionary step forward for sci fiction story telling. It fully immerses you in an alien world of machine and music. It uses the medium of virtual reality to tell a story that could not be told accurately any other way. If the purpose of communication is to get a thought or idea from one mind to another in the most lossless way possible then Synthesis Universe succeeds by leveraging everything VR brings to that process, At the end you get a sneak peak of what is coming in later episodes and I can't wait. The author has clearly spent a lot of time world building and for me what I want most from VR is to be placed in another world. The creativity and cohesiveness of the visuals is impressive. Thank you for this and I look forward to the rest.","Jun 14, 2020 at 12:10 AM",5, 2,"Thank you so so much to spend the time to write this.
You really do get all the work I do.

I was very sad to only have a review that complain it's too short/too expensive.
This makes my day, month and much more."
2022-05-28 18:43:04.406277,Wala2x,Great music experience,"For 10€ it's a bit expensive for what it delivers. It's a music video with a few tracks that lasts for about 15 minutes. That being said I don't regret the buy - it has cool synth-music and nice, really fitting visuals.
Should be 3 stars, but I really like the music. Dev, if you read this: I will support your work, but please deliver a bit longer lasting experiences next time, ok? :)

*Update: Still only three stars+1 because of the length and the price - even though there are some extras - I didn't miss them, but they don't last very long either.","Dec 13, 2019 at 4:23 PM",4, 6,"Well, I have some great news for you!
You missed 3 tracks!
After doing a story loop, you are back in the main hub.
From there you can go to 3 rooms using the ""teleportation flowers""
-Timeline rooms has ""Episode X"" with one new track.
-Robot building room
-Training/meditation room
Enjoy! (Hope that star is deserved fully now, please update your review if possible)
""Devs"" is just one, and I do read everything, I am here for you."
