2022-05-28 17:09:32.295122,crazy_hair_dude45,I wish it said it was not the full game,"this is just a portion of the full game, once you finish the 5 or so levels it loops you back to the beginning where you can change the difficulty. The playing was fun though, and the weapongs were cool. If you dont mind a very short game then I would recomend it for you.",Apr 2 at 11:31 PM,4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:09:38.664087,foofer1233,"Bad. Oh, so bad.","Probably the worst game I have ever played, VR or no VR. In fact, this game would probably be better on a flatscreen… it's so bad that I showed a friend who had never been in VR my headset, he tried this game, and he still said it was awful... and if a VR game is so bad that it overcomes the beautiful novelty that is virtual reality and a first-timer hates it? You know it's bad.

Now for actual constructive feedback, instead of just ranting. Shooting mechanics? Broken. Hitting people in the head barely does anything to low-level enemies, you have to headshot multiple times in order to get a kill sometimes. Graphics? Terrible, even on max settings. Shooting at cardboard cutouts while a man in a fake western accent drawls at you just isn't fun. Everything about this game is just a complete waste of money, or if you have the free version, a waste of disk space. Please, don't play it. Even the intro menu took me time to figure out, and I wasn't even in the game yet.","May 9, 2020 at 6:24 AM",1, 9,

2022-05-28 17:09:41.796709,Pud,Good,"For a demo game there is a lot to play with, multiple levels.
This is a wave shooter but with humour.
Its addictive, crazy, and simple.
Graphics are fantastic, the cartoon style fits in very well.
This demo is actually making me wishlist the full game! (waiting for a sale as I always do)","Jan 17, 2020 at 2:59 PM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 17:09:41.811669,Kenny8800,Awesome game. But Rift S is slow,The game is very cool and a lot of fun. I would have rated 5 stars if it had not been for the slow performance of the Rift S.

It says I've to uninstall but I can't uninstall anymore because the option uninstall is not there anymore, I only have the option to install and when I click on it, it starts installing then says that there is a problem and that's it. Each time I try to install, it's the same thing going on again. Come on ! We're not beta testers ! I work in the IT industry, you guys have to test your stuff first before making people pay for it just to find out it doesn't work correctly...","Jul 4, 2019 at 1:30 AM",1, 5,"Hello cowboy!

2022-05-28 17:09:45.038039,Comah,,"I downloaded the preface a while back but never got around to playing it.  Today, I decided to play the preface with open expectations.  At first I was thrown off using the basic revolvers with so many enemies being thrown at me.  I thought the graphics and sound effects are great for what they are as well as the touch control responses.  

Once I started using the other weapons the game finally clicked for me and I ended up purchasing the full game which happened to be on sale.

I would give it 4.5 if I could.  Minus half a star for no mulitplayer.","Nov 22, 2018 at 8:42 AM",4, 7,
