It's just a 360 video that you can choose which video will play, it's like if you don't buy a 4x4 from their brand you, are not a cool guy, and u cant explore nature or surf like a mannequin. After this, i will buy a ford bronco",Apr 11 at 12:21 PM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 18:08:06.187236,ajaswinski,KEEP IT AROUND FOR VISITORS,"Sadly, it's a bad corporate ad posing as a ""surfing adventure, brah!"". Bad optics, prosaic acting, some cute girls and that's about it. The last 20 seconds of surfing is what we all came for and it's not bad, but WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE A TRUE VR SURF GAME???!!!!","May 28, 2018 at 3:36 AM",2, 6,

2022-05-28 18:08:09.327836,nurocept,Looks like an experiment,"FoV and scale not that great, wanted a good look at the wrangler as we're looking at buying one but the download option didn't look like it was downloading, atleast from here in oz was getting a bad download speed, servers maybe located in US. Also why not download everything with the title/app, why force me to download or stream, I much prefer to download everything with the app. Always hate finding time to checkout an app only to find that I either have to download more content while I run the app in vr or stream which is just never that great for VR.

Deleting, not even worth showing to my wife.","May 19, 2018 at 12:13 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:08:09.342797,fariazz,Direct ticket to motion sickness,"I don't know how this app is clasified as ""comfortable"" - it does everything you are meant to avoid in VR:

1) arbitrary rotations
2) very quick changes, it's filmed like a video for a screen. In VR, you wanna get comfortable in the current shot before switching to the next one
3) in the surfing part, they kep on changing the angle on each shot. 

This would make for a great video on a screen, but unfortunately it's not a good VR experience.","Mar 31, 2018 at 2:11 PM",2, 9,
2022-05-28 18:08:09.357757,FastLawyer,360 Video ad for Jeep,"So after downloading the app, you can choose to stream or download all the video snippets. I would go ahead and download to get the best quality looking 360 videos. Once you start the experience, a short 360 video will play where you get to choose which Jeep you want to follow along with. After selecting the girls (you know you will) you get to ride along inside the Jeep. Then you'll choose the jungle or forest path. Another 360 short video will play until you get to the final 360 video short where you finally get to see some surfing. The 360 video quality is not the best, things definitely look better up close and start looking bad at a distance. But it's definitely a step above what you'd find on YouTube 360 videos for the most part. I'm not sure this app is worth the download. It was just okay.  2.5 stars out of 5.","Mar 28, 2018 at 7:47 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 18:08:09.372716,nightcat.mau,Surf's Up!,"Choose your own adventure, sort of. If you hang with the guys you kind of get flirted with along your path to two choices, each choice is a path that leads to some surfing. The ladies just want to hang out and leave the choice to you, again, two paths and surfing as a destination. The surfing was awesome, but I found myself twisting in my chair at times to see the action which was strangely behind me but I wasn’t on the board.
For a Jeep ad it’s the best I’ve ever seen. The surfers try and engage you, giving it a human element. For 380, it can be a bit blurry in some parts, crystal clear in others. Download is much clearer than the stream, though that ran like silk.","Mar 28, 2018 at 2:34 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:08:12.457466,ronnyrydgren,Sure free but totally worthless,"The idea is cool but bad executed. its just 2D 360 degree video. Scale issues and no sterescopic 3d. Also pictures is blurry in background, its really compressed format. I wouldnt recommend this experience to anyone","Mar 28, 2018 at 6:28 AM",1, 8,
