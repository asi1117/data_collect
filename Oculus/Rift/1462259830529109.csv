2022-05-28 15:08:18.168728,1quadra1,Community.,"I am an experienced DJ and discovered TribeXR while browsing the app store. After my first use, I was blown away by the accuracy and functionality. Don't be fooled— this isn't a game. It's a simulator. What you're getting is the REAL DEAL. The Pioneer CDJ-3000s and DJM-900 NSX2 mixer perform exactly like they do in real world. There was some initial setup and learning involved, but I was able to get my own tracks loaded into TribeXR and very quickly start practicing and building sets on familiar equipment.

Whether you're new to the world of DJing, or you're experienced like me, TribeXR is an excellent tool to learn new skills and meet other DJs. You don't just get a fantastically functioning app, you gain access to a flourishing community of DJs, producers and mentors. The discord chat is a great resource, providing technical support and general discussion. The TribeXR community is healthy, welcoming and full of great people.",22 days ago,5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:08:18.186680,Panoptic0n,"Bought for fun, stayed for the community","Bought the app seeking to scratch the itch of musical performance that I can't otherwise explore easily due to traveling a bunch for work. Never intended or expected to do much other than play for myself, maybe some close friends. After going to some of the free live workshops, found that I have a knack for this, and in some months, have made it to the point where I'm playing in multiple venues in VR, and looking to take things into the physical world as well!

Joining this community has made me friends around the world, and opened up so many things for me, not just in this app, but beyond!",Apr 5 at 7:29 AM,5, 4,

2022-05-28 15:08:18.217597,Ripple_The_Onion,Perfect for learning,"Ever since I could remember, I've always been fascinated with DJs, the equipment used and how they can transition from song to song seamlessly. But it always looked very intimidating and complicated (plus didn't want to risk buying a set-up for the possibility that I would never use it). When I saw this on the Oculus store, I immediately looked up reviews and there were some from pro DJs that claimed this app was incredibly accurate compared to irl equipment. 

I decided to buy this app at little risk given its price and OH MY GAD! The lessons make everything FAR LESS daunting and make things easy to understand. It's a bit of a learning curve, especially for those who have never touched this kind of thing, but I've only been playing for 2 days and I've come much farther in learning than I expected to and it's been incredibly fun. I've been playing for the past few hours having a good time learning how to transition between songs and I didn't notice how much the time actually flew by.",Feb 22 at 12:35 PM,5, 6,"Thanks for the feedback!

This is absolutely perfect to practice some mixes. Linked with beatport and soundcloud makes my music collection almost unlimited.

2022-05-28 15:08:21.353210,MikeypoloVR,BUY IT!,"This experience is so realistic. The equipment your using is a replica of the real thing. They offer 15 workshops a week to help you lay down the fundamentals. As soon as they teach you how to be in phrase, you can hold a decent mix. So really after 1 workshop i was able to just hop in and have fun. I believe that Tribe is a must-have for your collection. 

*Side Note- This game really highlights how you can use virtual reality to learn a new skill. Without this i would had to spend a wad of money on equipment, and lessons. This was only $30.",Nov 21 at 4:23 PM,5, 12,"Thank you for the review, ThickDaddy23! It is a pleasure to have you in our workshops and glad they gave you so much value.

2022-05-28 15:08:21.368170,aiden.hammy,Almost perfect.,"This game almost perfect, I find myself thinking about it a lot, and how much fun you are able to have with a friend, my only complaint is the learning curve, I dont want to take the time to learn the circle of fifths. I just dont have the time. i want to jump in with my friends and have a good time. Other DJ software have the function that auto key matches whatever song is in the first deck, and for that reason i always go for the 2D alternitve, when in reality I would much rather be in 3D. Other than that, for me its flawless. Thank you for a great game!",Oct 6 at 9:43 AM,4, 8,"Hey Aiden, the Pioneer CDJ3000 available in Tribe has a Key Sync feature that does what you're looking for. Pressing it will harmonize that deck with the master. Just switch to the CDJ3000 in the Content > Equipment menu if you haven't already. We also recommend joining our Discord and free workshops if you have any more questions/issues. Thanks!"
2022-05-28 15:08:21.384127,davidgrayphotography,An amazing app for learning how to DJ,"I'd been fascinated with DJing for years, but didn't know a thing about how it all worked. I watched a YouTube video or two, then wondered if there was something on the Quest, like DJ Hero or something I could play to scratch an itch, so I searched.

What I found instead was Tribe XR, which gave me a complete DJ experience with 1:1 replicas of actual hardware. I could load up songs from my own collection, mix them, apply filters, loop beats and set up cues for easy looping, just like on real Pioneer hardware.

The tutorials were extremely helpful, showing me what all the buttons did, and walking me through mixing my first two songs together. After spending some evenings just messing around while watching YouTube videos on advanced mixing techniques, I feel confident enough in my abilities, and I'm planning my first livestream.

I also feel confident enough that if someone were to put a real set of decks in front of me, I could probably start mixing right away.",Aug 30 at 11:45 AM,5, 10,"Hi David, thanks for the great review and glad you are enjoying Tribe XR so far.

Thanks for the review and glad you are enjoying Tribe.  The main culprit of the behavior you mention is usually files download from tube conversion sites, which have lately been using compression that is corrupt in some way and causes mp3's to not load into the decks.  The remedy for that is usually re-encoding the files in audacity, VLC, or Goldwave.  Goldwave has a great batch conversion tool that can re-encode entire folders of music.  Visit our Discord at http://discord.gg/tribexr for more help on this topic.  If you still have issues please post in #help or DM me there!

I have to say, the weekly online classes are GOLDEN and really helped me feel comfortable behind the decks😱! Lol

Not the same offcourse, lacks some features, one I missed a lot is to be able to set manual bpm and grid by hitting a button on beats. It's pretty usefull for precise matching, even though in cd mode the jogs do a great job on keeping the beat and the pitch bar works very good.",Sep 26 at 3:46 AM,4, 0,"great to hear Aralmo, thanks for your review.

2022-05-28 15:08:27.691258,zerosolidus,DJ gear on the go,"Being used to a full size mixers and decks, this VR counterpart blew me away with how easy it was to start playing and mixing like on a real set of decks. There wasn't a moment where I asked myself ""..it's missing this and that...""

Due to limited space at home, I have most of my gear stored away and occasionally pull it out which can take me up to 30 minutes to setup and with a kid running around, I don't have the time for the setup and tear down. With Tribe I transfer songs I want to work with, launch the app and start mixing.

Two things I do wish they offered; the ability to use your Tidal account and the ability to record your master out to as wav/mp3.

Final comment; I did wish they mentioned that you only get 2 decks and need to buy an add-on to add an additonal set of decks which can bring the number up to 4. If it is listed, then I completly missed it.","Feb 6, 2021 at 2:34 PM",5, 14,"Thank you for the review and feedback! We are looking into Tidal integration and also in-app recording features for sure.  Both would be great additions as you mentioned.  You do need to purchase the 4 deck add-on, and we will double check to make sure that is more clear on the outset.  Enjoy!"

Also the interaction/haptic feedback with the cdjs is alot better than I imagine they would be. It's as good as having the real thing in front of you.

Why not 5 stars? I had it crash out on my quest 2. Also no 3 band isolator, please add I beg you and will be instant 5 stars 😁  Also be nice to have a in app feature to record sets as mp3.  Keep up the good work, well worth the cash.","Nov 7, 2020 at 4:34 AM",4, 15,"Thank you for the feedback! The 3-band isolator is a great idea, perhaps we can integrate as a separate device🤔.

2022-05-28 15:08:30.841831,ilovefood02,I really dont even know where to start,"TLDR throw your money at this as fast as humanly possible i swear to you, it is so incredibly worth it. 

i purchased this purely out of curiosity and it really is an incredible experience, i went in without a single bit of knowledge. I mean ive never even seen a deck in person! With the built in video tutorials (some even interactive) i was able to grasp the basics in less then an hour. within 3 i was making poor mixes and transitions while playing with the EQ. Here i am about 4 days later maybe 8 or 9 hours under my belt and im having an incredible time. But my experience really changed once i joined the discord, i mean the discord really makes this ""game"". the community is incredible i havent met anyone even slightly rude, and every single person wants to help you. the tribe team even sets up workshops where you can hop in a lobby with them and have hands on training with them at no cost to you. Do they have to do this? No. Could they take your money and run? Yes. But they dont do that, they continue to treat you beyond what you would expect from them even once you have given them your money, how many other devs can you say that about? Seriously in this day and age that may as well be alien. Ozan is one of the most incredible people ive ever met and i can tell he truly cares about this project. All i can really say is thank you tribe team. Your actions speak volumes.

Edit: Id like to add in a lot of low star reviews from years ago are just down right inacurate just in case you see those :)","Aug 13, 2020 at 12:24 PM",5, 23,"Bigups, my man. Thank you so much for the kind review. Time to rock the place :) -Ozan"

2022-05-28 15:08:30.888706,Mister_Fonzie,Become a DJ Superstar,"This is one of my favorite apps, and really is only possible in VR.  This is not a game or a toy, but a legitimate DJ experience.  I'm no DJ, but I can make that claim by having access to tools that make it possible to replicate virtually, what DJs are doing in the real world.  It does what it states.  It takes from a complete beginner to a competent DJ, or as far as you want to go.

As a music lover, TribeXR has allowed me to switch from a passive listener, to a music driver.  Initially, I just started out loading up some of my favorite songs, setting the EQ, and hitting play.  However, once I started experimenting with the tools, I was able to be much more active than just a listener.  The sheer amount of options can be overwhelming, but support from the developers on Discord is phenominal.  Questions get answered quickly, and if it's something that has been asked and answered, you are immediately pointed in the right direction.  Almost as soon as you ask, ""How do I...?"" or ""Is it possible to...?"" the answer pops up

It makes music fun.  Even if you had no intentions of doing anything other than playing around with your music collection, it's only a matter of time before you find yourself streaming to Twitch.  The first few weeks, I'm thinking, I can't do that.  However, now I can't wait to broadcast, even though only maybe one or two (or none) of my friends is watching/listening, I'm still having a blast.  Once you start a multiplayer session, then it's a party.

Lastly, I just want to add that there is a really great community around TribeXR.  Not only are the developers super accommodating, I've been given solid advice from seasoned pros.  They've shared tips from mixing and music selection, to how to broadcast into virtual spaces such as Altspace and Sansar.   For the cost of dinner for two, this app easily has the value 100 times that.","Aug 15, 2020 at 7:18 AM",5, 4,Thank you Mister_Fonzie for your awesome review! We really appreciate it!

The haptic feedback for the controls along with highlighting of controls before you engage makes controlling the virtual setup really easy.  If you've DJ'd on any CDJ setup before, you'll pick this up within seconds.  If it's your first time or you want to learn how to DJ and you have either an Oculus Quest or a PC/VR headset I would definitely recommend you trying Tribe XR out first before spending any money on equipment, and Tribe can also hook you up with a pro DJ to help you get started.  There's a good, supportive community behind the product, the sound quality is great, definitely something you can reliably stream.  Tribe XR has become my go-to setup with my physical DJ gear in the corner of the room, I can't wait to see how much further the Tribe team can push this software in the future.","Aug 1, 2020 at 8:48 AM",5, 7,Thank you virtualuk!

At around £23 I could've got a pizza and drinks and not whats but I decided not too and purchased this DJ software and it does it magnifcently, I'm quite impressed. The Tutorials are easy to Follow on the how to and what button does what! My only gripe is I need more audio codecs like flac which is a lossless format but If I put a music audio file which is flac there isn't any music in the folder so I've to convert flac to mp3 so it takes away the quality slightly. Would I recommend this app definitely 100% I'm not a DJ in any manor of speaking but when putting the headset on I felt like a DJ. I've a YouTube channel too which I might start posting my video Music Live sessions too at anthonykennethbishop. Cheers.

2022-05-28 15:08:37.243709,TrainWreck42o,Good Show!,"Polished Graphics VERY NiCE
Music browser - artist, bmp & key only - no song titles or note field so you better know your stuff.
Latency issues using high end audio devices (Numark 4trak), I turned down to 198 samples 5.9ms but it's still slightly off! Big issue if this sofware wants to be thought of as more than a toy. Even as a training tool in order to beat-match it needs to be better optimised. (latency wise)
No separate 3/4 cue output? We are forced to use the virtual earphones which are not expained during tutorial, instead the earphone section is explained to us ""real world"" which is insane and totally confusing, this is VR after all.
- ATM this is ""hands up"" the best DJ VR software to date and the devs are totally cool and into this project. I'm expecting great things. 
- I would quickly like to add, one of the first things i would update is the browser. We need more info beyond Artist - bmp - key.   Being that this is a ""merging"" of reality and VR i think it would be ok to stray from the ""bounds"" of the real world simulation in regard to browsing our music files. My thoughts are make it VERY VR!

It needs more players though. Mostly no open rooms to join and to party in. People that joined my room vanished quickly. Maybe the music sucked or it just misses some kind of interaction to make people stay. I wasn't able to fidle with it to much though. 
Gonna try the twitch feature next time. Maybe this way it attracts more people. ;)

Best VR-App I own so far. THX","Mar 7, 2020 at 5:37 AM",5, 0,Thanks for the note Motion. We are about to release a new feature that enable multiplayer track syncing so you can DJ back-to-back with others on the fly. That should increase the party vibe in the rooms.

It's deeply immersive, offers a quick and straightforward guide to get you started and has you feeling like a real DJ in no time flat! I've already spent countless hours burried in the decks trying to find out how to better create and mix music. I've never touched any electronic music equipment before in my life but this absolutely makes me want to play at any and all venues that I can to show off what I've learned. The fact that it saves you hundreds of dollars to buy one of these decks in real life is a truley beautfil thing too. :)

2022-05-28 15:08:40.415226,filippo.scarone,VERY GOOD TO DJ IN VR,"Don't worry about my 3 star, the application is good, pretty good. But being an WIP it's far from 5 stars review (IMO). I enjoyed my hour of mixing and it has gone very well, but here something to work on to better improve the experience:
-Using only rekordbox or iTunes is very restrictive, just leave the possibility to use the library of the pc
-Improve the precison of touch controller (they are a bit off in my experice)
-Setting up the audio is not so perfect still: I set my sound card for the master and rift headphone for CUE, but if I don't turn on virtual headphones I hear the master in the Headphone. Therefore the knob in the headphones section do not work as intended (cue-master is useless). Then with virtual headphons both turned on , the master still came by but very muffled (litle heavy low filter is applied, very disturbing).
-Improve Cdj/Vynil mode like the real thing, so in CDJ mode the track can pause the single beat an better set up cue point.
Just work on this little improvements and I will be glad to update my review along with the game!","Mar 14, 2020 at 10:38 PM",3, 0,"Thanks for the feedback, filippo.scarone. This is super helpful. We should make these features easier and better. 

Just so you know: You can always use your personal music library. Just copy your music files into your Windows Music folder. 
 
You can increase the controller precision. It’s a setting in the Tribe > Settings window. 

To turn on the Cue audio, please click next to your physical ear (as if you’re putting on headphones)

You can isolate the Cue audio. Go to Tribe > Settings and set room isolation to 100%

Hope that helps. If not, please join us on Discord and ping me, Ozan. I can help you troubleshoot."
2022-05-28 15:08:43.506957,inlinexd,"Promising, with some flaws.","The application works surprisingly well, and controlls etc feel extremely polished. 
 The multiplayer functionality is also excellent, for B2B or tutoring.  However, while I understand that this is not a professional piece of software, there are some drawbacks that limit my ability to reccommend this to either new DJs or experienced ones.

Firstly, the song browser is downright trash.  There's no search feature, meaning if you want to find a specific track you have to scroll through the entire list, and there is no way to sort the tracks through any of the tags, such as BPM or key.  This makes finding tracks that you can transition into extremely slow and difficult, meaning you spend more time looking for the right songs that actually playing them.

Secondly, the sync beatmatching is poor - and while this may not be hampering to experienced DJs, it is a useful feature for those learning, which is what this game markets itself as.  This also makes the 4-deck DLC less appealing, because without sync you can't easily do multi-track transitions.

Other than these 2 gripes, the experience is smooth and the application is extremely promising.  I hope the developers work to improve this excellent concept.

There are a few suggestions I have for features that could be implemented in the future:
- Cards, or posters, with useful information such as controller mappings or a camelot wheel.
- Being able to build tracklists in the song browser, and make subfolders there.
- Other hardware, such as simpler controllers for new DJs, or drum machines etc (potentially as paid dlc).

Overall, for an early access game this is worth picking up if you're interested in DJing, although it could use some improvements before a full release in my opinion.","Aug 31, 2019 at 6:53 AM",4, 17,"Thanks so much for the feedback. Really excellent points raised. We plan to improve track search a lot. At the moment you do need to scroll as you mention. It's an often requested improvement and in our product pipeline. Sync should work well. If you have time to jump in with us we'll happily try to help identify what's causing the issue. It should work well if you reset the start point of the track, and the adjustment in cue should be pervasive. We'd LOVE to discuss the suggestions you raise, they seem excellent. We have a community on discord (www.discord.gg/tribexr) where we have a whole channel focused on suggestions and improvements. Thank you! The Tribe XR team."

I was looking for something that I wasn't going to struggle with trying to understand what was going on  on top of learning how to work the controls.  Having 13 years experience with internet broadcasting when I saw this was on free trial I said ok let's see what that is all about. I would likely buy more apps if I could try them out like this. 

 With a background prior to my DJ experience in sound engineering and music  the early bits were a bit slow and tedious for me, though I do give props for descriptions that to me sounded  detailed enough that I can probabl sit my husband down with this and he could figure it out with no experience in anything related to DJing or sound mixing! 

Aside from that, not even 15 minutes in, and I knew  that this was going to be an app that I would really want to use and bought it! I'm loving it already!","Aug 18, 2019 at 6:31 AM",5, 8,

Welcome to Tribe XR a really fun app that lets you DJ without an expensive CDJ equipment and with almost the same feel as a real CDJ .. I work in the events industry mostly on the visual side and we always have DJs over in most of our events and i have always seen them at work but never knew what they were doing . Untill i got this App.. It kept me up the whole night the day i bought it and now am up most days messing around in it. My boss used to be a Dj back in the days of Vinyl and i showed this to him and he almost felt at home with it. I would say Tribe XR has hit the tip of an iceberg. They have a lot of opertunity here to make all sorts of equipments . And i am excited to be a part of the journey.. The possibilities are endless from vinyl Decks to Having a virtual audience  and different scenes i would love to see were they will take this app during its journey to being a full release.  As for why i titled this review with a question mark .Its because its coming to the quest and wireless VR DJ is coming soon :-). BUY IT NOW and join the tribe in Discord the community is great and so is the Twitch Streams. Lots to learn if you are a newbie like me . Or you will feel at home if you are a Pro DJ .

Just recently got into VR, and finding out that there are apps for DJing got me intrigued. Stepping into TribeXR brought me back to the groove, to the head-bopping and to the roof-raising. It took a while to figure out the Virtual Headphones (had to watch a youtube video for it). Once I got that down, I was back, doing some beatmatching.

My only gripe is opening the app--it's blank, and there is no indication that it's loading or anything. Wait a couple of minutes in the dark and suddenly you're behind the decks. Everything else is gravy.","Jun 7, 2019 at 12:55 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:08:49.824061,T1NGUK,,"So I picked up this app a couple of weeks ago on the Oculus store and not been able to put it down.
I had tried a couple of other similar ones but they just dont compare. If your looking to DJ in VR then you need TribeXR. 
I had thought using it would feel clunky and not going to work well like the others i had tried but was hugely surprised with how well the touch controllers work on the jog wheels and all other aspects of the mixer. Going from real decks/CDJ and mixer to this is no problem, within 5 minutes I was dropping tunes and beat matching like I was using a real setup. 

Features it has
CDJ tempo
Touch sensitive Jog wheels
Loop functions
Normal Cue and 3 hot cues that save and work in your next session
A beat Sync option
a display where you can quick search a loaded track
the mixer has various crossfader options
it has effects for trans,echo, flanger and roll across all 4 channels 
It also has colour effects per channel for dub echo, filter and 2 others I cant remember right now. 
you can cut the highs mids and lows with the nobs as you would expect on any decent mixer. 
You can load music directly from your music folder.
It also has the ability to stream to twitch. 

If your a veteran DJ or some one starting out, its great for both and any one in between. Tribe also has a great community which you can find on discord who are happy to help and also mentor users if they need it.","Mar 26, 2019 at 4:59 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:08:49.841015,bagel330,"Amazing Software, Awesome Community!","I've been a bedroom DJ for about two years now. I've been using Tribe for about a couple months as of writing this, and I love it! Whether you want to learn how to DJ or you already are a DJ, TribeXR is for you. Tribe is an incredible practice tool. It gives you access to club/festival standard DJ equipment worth $5000+ for a very low price. For anyone who wants to play at a club or festival one day, it is very important to be familiar with this setup. 

As I mentioned before, Tribe is an excellent way to learn to DJ, hence ""TribeXR DJ School"". It supports multiplayer, for B2B DJing (multiple people DJing at the same time on the same equipment) and also to teach DJing. You can have a mentor connect with you and join your room, which is pretty much the equivalent of having a real instructor with you in real life. Tribe is partnered with Pyramind Music School, so you are able to get a professional instructor in Tribe if you'd like. Ellaskins the DJ tutor (from Youtube) also does lessons in Tribe.

Tribe is also a great live performance tool. There is a Twitch integration which makes livestreaming a great experience. The audience can choose GIFs to display on the back wall behind the DJ and request tracks using chat commands. Before I joined the Tribe community, I couldn't imagine myself livestreaming on Twitch, but now I do it all the time and have an absolute blast doing it! Tribe has also been used live at a club before.

One of the main things that separates Tribe from other VR DJ programs is the awesome and very active community and dev team. The comminity and devs are all very friendly and helpful. There is always someone willing to help with any issue you may have, or to help you learn to DJ and use Tribe. The devs take every suggestion seriously and there are always new features being worked on.

I very strongly recommend TribeXR, I use it a lot more than my physical DJ controller.","Mar 27, 2019 at 10:20 AM",5, 9,

To start the journey, we offer every Tribe user a live intro lesson to DJing, on pro-grade virtual equipment with a real mentor (aka an actual person, in VR). This lasts 15 minutes, and covers off the basics. Please join our Discord channel and we'll coordinate things from there. (https://discordapp.com/invite/qdhNs2U). 
With regard to lessons- interactive videos are coming in the next release (within 1 week). For track analysis and beat gridding, two tips: 1: please turn off quantize on each track. This is located to the top left, by the display, on the left and right controllers. 2: use a combination of either setting hot cues, or using the cue button to fix the start point. We are working to add pervasive cue points and better beat grids at the moment, please look out for that in coming releases. You'll find a ton of relevant feedback and help on our Discord channel. We ship a new build approximately every 2 weeks. Otherwise, please contact us at info@tribexr.com, or contact us through Facebook (www.facebook.com/tribevr/), and we'll hopefully be able to make your experience on Tribe a little smoother!

What an awesome first experience. I took a lesson in Tribe with renown DJ Ellaskins. I had no experience previously with DJ’ing, but during the lesson, I learned how to analyze two tracks and know when to switch between the two. I have a lot more to learn, and I am excited about my next lesson. I cannot encourage Tribe more. If you have always wanted to try DJ’ing as I have, I would definitely suggest taking a lesson. That is where the experience really shines. Being in VR with your instructor and being able to engage with them as if it was in person.

I love the interface, the setting is dope, and the DJ controller looks and works exactly like the real thing. Can't wait to see what comes next.","Aug 17, 2018 at 8:03 AM",5, 4,Thanks for the review - appreciated! The Tribe XR Team.
2022-05-28 15:08:59.372522,Neontop,First time being a DJ,"For the First time I can feel how wonderful and creative to be a DJ. 

I`m completely new on DJ mixing so I tried the first immersive demo lesson. 

This is quit an VR experience which I enjoyed. 

As it is an early access I'm sure that TribeVR will surprise us in the coming future. 

I would like to see a quit button on the main menu or perhaps I missed that one. 

 

Ps: I apologize for my bad English as I'm a real French.","Jul 30, 2018 at 10:25 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:09:02.531074,SoundscapeAgency,Love This!,Just downloaded the most recent version and found the whole experience totally awesome. My first insight into DJ'ing and the lessons helped me understand the basics quickly. Freeplay mode opened up a world of possibilites and control to the point where I felt like a professional DJ! Will def carry on with this.,"May 29, 2018 at 5:34 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:09:02.548029,BlunkedTV,Welp,"Check out vinyl reality on steam store, if you want to be able to move the tempo, touch the platters and actually beat mix(i'm talking actually doing this, there is no auto beat matching button (sorry laptop dj's)).

This VR experience is pre loaded mp3's at the same tempo.

Hope it comes good, but already there are better ways to spend your money if you are an old school dj looking to rekindle that itch.



You have my $5 for 13 more days until i refund

edit: Never refunded, Will check it out again, good luck dev","Mar 15, 2018 at 1:42 PM",4, 1,"Hi BlunkedTV - please make sure to try out the new fully-featured decks. These are available in Free Play mode. You can DJ with your own tracks, use effects, loops and more. Enjoy! The Tribe Team."

I have zero experience in DJ, and just wanted to try this for fun. Looking at the deck was overwhelming with all the knobs and buttons, but it still did a good job of explaining and easing someone entirely new into learning it.  Looking forward to see more added!","Jan 17, 2018 at 1:26 PM",4, 4,"Hi dpham81, thank your for your review. We are working to bring you new features and lessons in the coming weeks.

2022-05-28 15:09:05.647738,rodowhite,,"Incredibly deceiving description and graphics, there are no worthwhile lessons and the huge table has only like 2-3 working knobs. You basically mix by cross fading from a pre-selected list of music and that's it. No excuse for this being early access either since this looks more like a prototype than anything. The free mode is basically playing cross fade while the DJ in front of you does the Spiderman gif dance from 2004. Absolute waste of money.","Jan 16, 2018 at 8:42 AM",1, 5,"Hi rodowhite, please make sure to try out the updated Tribe.

2022-05-28 15:09:05.681647,dilanshah,Interesting primer on DJing,"With no DJ background or prior experience operating a proper DJ system, I now understand the cross-fader, EQ nobs, and handling tracks at a mechanical level. That's pretty remarkable all things considered. This is an innovative approach to teaching DJing and surely will benefit from additional lessons. I liked how by constraint you can only use certain areas of the system, for a beginner it's an intimidating board. I'd like to be able to record and playback, share and export, and perhaps better understand details like bpm matching and so on as others suggest.","Jan 4, 2018 at 4:15 AM",4, 4,"Thanks for your candid feedback. We are adding features week-by-week, so please keep an eye out for them in upcoming releases. All of the elements you outline are in the upcoming roadmap, along with more lesson content going beyond the basic mechanics of DJing. Thank you! The Tribe Team."
2022-05-28 15:09:05.698602,ronnyrydgren,Missguided Info,"I love to learn how to DJ. Some basics i do know.
The description is very off. You dont learn how to DJ yet. I know its early access and the product isnt finnished. However the description should also make clear that there is no content to learn who to DJ yet. There is one lesson and its garbage, it basically say to play the second track at 16 seconds in. Which is not learning how to DJ at all. It works for those 2 songs at that bpm those songs have. However speed up or slowed down songs that you mix with wouldnt match. Instead they should teach about bars and how to count and when to drop the beat on what bar and teach more messurment. its a love the idea but doesnt match description near at all currently. Even early access should have a matching description for how much it content it currently is or what vision they have. buy if you want to help with funding them but dont buy to learn anything cause its nothing currently to learn.","Dec 23, 2017 at 8:44 PM",1, 5,"Hi Ronny .- please make sure to try the latest version of Tribe.

2022-05-28 15:09:08.806290,theregoes2,At the moment there is not much here,"I was pretty pumped when I saw this because I used to have my own professional turntables and I miss them. I thought that this would be adequate to scratch the itch but it needs a lot more. I can't cue tracks, beat match, scratch, or even have my own music. Hopefully all of these features are coming. If they do come and they are implemented well my rating will go up and I'll use this app all the time. For now though, it's one very short lesson that most people could figure out on their own and a free play mode that is severely limited and only gives access to a handful of tracks. What it does, it does well. It just doesn't do much yet","Dec 19, 2017 at 7:00 AM",2, 6,"Hi theregoes2, please make sure to try the latest version of Tribe.
