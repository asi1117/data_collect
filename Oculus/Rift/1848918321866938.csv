2022-05-28 19:39:45.333157,VibrationsOfDoom,Great fun; remember arcade game Pooyan?,"Wow, this was fun. It reminded me SO much of the old arcade game Pooyan, where you have a pig riding up and down in a lift shooting wolves that are floating up towards you on balloons... Well, this takes that concept and turns it on it's head. In fact, the huge boss is throwing out these meanies, and even getting rid of them is the same from the old game Pooyan: Shooting the balloon causes the baddie to drop, taking out any baddies directly below him! Still, this game has twists: Poison bombs shot at you, powerups, and even a ""fever"" wave that's really fun! Graphics are somewhat kid oriented but don't let that fool you, this game is quite enjoyable. I did have an issue during the boss battle where sometimes I couldn't get the bow and arrow to ""lock,"" but the boss battle was fun, though pretty difficult. Quite an enjoyable game, and one I'll definitely come back to!","Apr 3, 2019 at 8:51 AM",4, 1,"Thank you so much of your enjoying. 

We also know the old arcade game Pooyan. Glad to hear that our game looks familiar with that kind of famous arcade game and it's enjoyable. 

We hope many people can enjoy Lolly Pang VR with those happy memories of childhood.

Thank you."

It has powerups to the bow & arrow (turns into crossbow or laser later on) and health pickups. Mostly shooting balloons with a laser guided bow but there are some elements thrown in to keep it from getting too repetitive and even a boss fight. Still, the whole aesthetic makes it something mostly fun for kids.","Oct 22, 2018 at 1:54 AM",4, 4,
