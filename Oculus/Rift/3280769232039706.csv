The scares are really not scares they are so slow 

Maps are poorly designed ie rooms not put together properly and you have gaps everywhere you look

No scenery so when you look out the windows all you see is a white void which takes the realism out of a horror game 

this game could have been alot better but it is very dissapointing 

Sorry for the bad review but i have to tell it how it is.","Aug 10, 2020 at 9:39 AM",1, 40,
