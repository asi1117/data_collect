2022-05-28 20:46:30.440779,djlegacy2k5,It's not a BAD game but...,"There isn't much to it. It's got some cool parts but it's very basic and enemy soldiers just run straight at you. Also, the game is on sale ever since I bought it and I haven't seen a SINGLE update to this game. I don't know if there is a roadmap anywhere but most EA games I own get constant updates, improvements and additional content of which I have seen ZERO from this game since I've owned it. Not sure what the plans are but if you're bored, it's a decent basic game with a couple cool moments.","Aug 19, 2020 at 9:43 AM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 20:46:30.468704,Lalle75,There are games worse than this...,"...but not many. In general I like these Chernobyl Stalker settings. But this game only s*cks. It started with not getting the notes on the floor, because the VR floor was lower than the real one. No resetting or adjusting from inside the game possible.
Than the game itself:
- The whole game is dark gray.
- Nearly no textures.
- Very low detailed models.
- Very close fogging (small visible area).
- Enemies shoot you from the fog.
- Pistol aiming is very bad.
- Very bad driving or flying ""physics"".
- Grabbing items often grabs the wrong one or nothing (especially durings fights.
- Radiation grows constantly and damages your health.

Maybe some unexperienced VR games will like this, but I will ask for a refund.","Jul 2, 2020 at 2:29 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 20:46:30.483664,Salyavin,Atmospheric but too challenging for me,"It's fun, the graphics are good, the weapons work pretty well, but I struggle to get a good aim, and take too much damange and die, being forced to go back to the start, auto save checkpoints, or adaptive difficultly settings would be great.  I have to say I've just given up after almost getting to the next base, but keep dying and feel like I need to start again :-(","May 31, 2020 at 7:32 PM",4, 3,"Hi! Thank you for playing our game! The next patch will be a bigger update, gameplay won't be too hard, there will be checkpoints on the map, and there will be multiplayer mode."
2022-05-28 20:46:33.600328,EviLorD,Great Graphics - Fun game.,"Being an early access game I am hoping my comments are already in the pipeline for an update.  
Really like this so far.. the countdown to find health and radiation pills does put an urgent feel to the game.   

FEATURES TO ADD - 
PLEASE add a way to smooth turn,  its the 1st thing many of us look for when setting up a new game.  The movement is great, just make a smooth turn option,  Also let the gun holster on both sides.  The left handed people like me will be happy you thought of us...  

PROBLEM
I only ran in to 1 problem playing,  I could not get the gun to re-load unless I put it in my left hand.   When its in my right hand I can change the clip but I can not pull the slide?   Being left handed I just kept the gun in my left hand.","Apr 12, 2020 at 1:55 AM",3, 15,"Hello! There is smooth turn function in the game, you can turn off the snap rotation in the settings. You can reload the gun in both hands. Check the gun reload tutorial paper at the second map's starter point, to how to reload the pistol correctly."

My Quick Thoughts:
For an early access game this was a lot better than I was expecting to be honest. I had some clipping issues shooting my weapon over objects and I wasn't keen on starting each level from the start when I died. But combat was OK, with a good atmosphere, nice sets and smooth gameplay.","Apr 23, 2020 at 1:42 AM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 20:46:33.645208,Giff Packham,Am I that short?!,"I really want to get into this game but cannot get out of the train cars as I'm only about 2ft tall!

Is there any way I can change my height please Devs??!!","Apr 30, 2020 at 11:14 PM",4, 1,"Hello. The game is using the height, that you set at Oculus height settings. Maybe you have to recalibrate the height(oculus rift) or the floor level(oculus rift s). Just click 'Set floor position' under Devices --> Configure Rift in the oculus desktop software."
