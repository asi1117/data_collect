2022-05-28 13:16:12.153220,yigalzr,WOW,"It is like nothing I experienced before in VR gaming. feels like actually being inside a noir mistery horror movie.
Amazing concept, atmosphere and creativity.
Good job!!!

Update:
Changing the rating from 5 stars to 4 - got to combat sections, and they are done, how to say gently... not to well.

Still a good game though.",Mar 5 at 9:24 AM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:16:12.168180,MadPropz101,One of the best VR games.,"A unique concept, engrossing atmosphere, and memorable characters...this game has it all. The voice-acting, models and animation quality are top-notch, and the game has a very decent length to it as well.

The setting is reminiscent of a retro comic book horror-mystery, filled with memorable moments and dark humor. It has a meaningful ending which doesn't feel rushed like most games.

The only thing that could be a downside is that sometimes it wasn't quite clear what you could (or should) do to progress further.

All in all, this is one of the hidden gems of VR. An amazing experience, and will remain a must-play for years to come 👍",Jan 2 at 12:11 PM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 13:16:12.184137,dethovu,A Masterpiece of VR Storytelling,"I play this every Halloween since it launched. It's just the right kind and amount of horror for me. A game made for Oculus Touch and it shows right from the opening scene, making you very aware that your hands play an important role in the upcoming adventure. So much, in fact, that the game's entire concept is wrapped around using your hands to manipulate VR in interesting, albeit natural ways. The game controls the direction and scene, allowing you to choose pre-selected spots to travel to. This may be off putting for some, but is absolutely necessary in the way the game brilliantly directs the story, action, puzzles and pace. It achieves a perfect blend of VR comfort and difficultly that allows for just about anyone to jump in. No backtracking! Even the boss fights won't back track: If you die while on, say, the 3rd sequence level of a boss, you'll restart on the 3rd sequence (nice! it respects your time and won't bore you with having to do the same actions over and over again). All the characters in the game are hyper-quality in their textures, animations, voice overs and interactions.  The little details that are there, like the way their eyes follow you, make it really feel like you're in the room with another person. Amazing story, satisfying and actually pretty emotional ending if you pay attention to the ending (stay after the credits!). You'll know why the main character is such a pessimistic hardass. A masterpiece. It really does feel like you're inside a Twilight Zone episode. Absolutely brilliant. Wish we got more like this one for VR.",Oct 31 at 12:13 PM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 13:16:12.199097,TomCgcmfc,Nice but No smooth locomotion,"Great game but even with the new update you still need to physically turn around up yo 180deg to see your next location(s).  A simple smooth turning option would be nice.  Not too bad with my Q2 wireless with Air Link, sitting on a swivel chair.",Nov 22 at 7:34 AM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 13:16:12.214057,RichardCyberPunk,Gives me the good old scary movie vibes,Superb game. Loving the black/white graphics and reminds of me of the old scary movies of the 1930-50s. A must have for fans of the genre (even in 2021 !),Dec 22 at 4:14 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:16:15.341748,kf2010,Excellent game with a few flaws,"Overall, great game! Very immersive graphics-- and you'll know the possible good reason for the monochrome style when you reach the very end after the credits scene. Wonderful set pieces, especially the ending. You feel you are within a movie, definitely.

Now, a few small flaws. First is some wonky control bugs here and there like when you throw stuff or sometimes when you wear stuff like gloves and push elevator buttons LOL. You'll know what I mean when you get there. Also the combat piece seem to be overdone, with very repetitive patterns as well as literally repetitive combat.

Let us end on a great note, though. Again, excellent game. The story is solid. The puzzles are self-guiding, and though some may be ""WTF?!"", but in the end, it's fun to think out of the box as an escape from our world of ""logic"". So had a lot of fun playing this one. No regrets :)","Jun 1, 2021 at 12:32 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 13:16:15.356708,davebaze,Solid,"I've seen this game played on Youtube, and decided to give it a go. My first AAA game on my headset was Half Life: Alyx. While this isn't as innovative (or massive), the gameplay and graphics offered here are rock solid. I played it on my Quest 2, with Medium settings (high had my computer screaming too loudly, lol). The character details/textures are amazing! I love the black and white filter. It works here. The characters all feel like real people, and it truly feels like you're playing in an old horror film. The Fly scene got me, especially since I HATE bugs lol! I found myself studying the character designs more than actually listening to them, lol! Didn't mind the look-and-click teleporation to traverse areas. Excellent choice for people who aren't used to VR and may experience motion sickness. The puzzles are simple, and the boss fights are slightly repetative once you recognize their patterns, but highly entertaining. The voice acting is top notch, and the character animations are convincing. Not a lot of items to interact with beyond bottles you can break and a few light switches (not couting the items you need to progress the story), but the game doesn't need that ""sandbox"" feel. The story is engaing, and the sound design and use of perspective/scale are amazing. First time in VR? This is a great introduction! Get it!","May 4, 2021 at 9:56 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:16:15.371668,kekosalt1,Original AAA Title,"As a dedicated VR enthusiast of seven or so years, I feel compelled to defend Wilson's Heart against more recent negative reviews. Yes, Half Life Alyx is absolute GOLD! I kinda wept a bit in my headset when first seeing City 17 from the opening balcony. Asgard's Wrath is some of the purest, most amazing gaming I have ever done in my four decades of video games. But, man, how quickly we turn on true innovation! Wilson's Heart is nearly four years old. Folks are now trashing it for its ""antiquated"" mechanics and node interface, when at the time - JUST four years ago - it was stellar! Wilson's Heart is an absolutely gorgeous, tension filled, well written, highly produced masterpiece! For those who have not played it - go into it with an open mind. Expect a game where standing STILL (not turning around all the time) and turning your head and using nodes is expected. Again, it's four years old. It is still beautiful, deep, fun, unexpected, with great voice acting and set pieces. W's H also has one of the most engaging story lines of any game ever made for VR. If you want a run and gun FPS then don't buy it. But if you want a fun and rare and unique (in a good way) gaming experience don't hesitate on it. It uses teleportation nodes and it DOES have 360 degree movement - though you will often have to reorient your body in your play space if you turn too much. That doesn't mean the game isn't wonderful. It absolutely is.","May 15, 2021 at 7:04 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 13:16:15.386628,kriszvandaar,I'm scared,"I played Half Life Alyx, Resident Evil 7, and all the Zombie stuffs, but this game makes me take a s.. in my pants when those midget monsters are heading to me, and I can't just kill them (special combat system) there is something really creepy in that game, but I'll come back, and Im going to finish it because I wanna see how this will end. I started to play it on gtx 970 and it already performed super good, but later, with a better gpu, it became even more beautiful. It's just too much realistic for my nervous system.

2022-05-28 13:16:18.480487,andymosk,Cool experience ruined by AWFUL combat,"This game is a lot of fun but the combat is the worst I've experienced in VR. It's very hard to aim or time your strikes and you end up repeating the same sequences over and over. I think I did one scene 30 times before I pulled it off. For a mostly narrative/puzzle game, it's just bad design.","Jan 15, 2021 at 11:05 AM",3, 3,

 Movment controls  are terrible,only a few teleport points and having to turn around  to select them  is very inconvenient with a cable.  Also require lot of room for no reason, it could be played seated. Some part are really primitive compare to other  vr game.","Jan 6, 2021 at 10:29 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 13:16:18.511404,DelapierceD,Wonderful Story / Gameplay,"Excellent world building. Great characters, script,  and story. Plot development / unfolding is engaging and well done. A ""puzzle game"" but in situations that are real to the logic of the world (find fuel and matches, or the right paintings for the sequence) and match the tough-guy surrealist horror theme (think Bruce Campbell / Army of Darkness)

Rich gameplay development. Start out just looking around. Eventually, combine poisons, burn / electrocute monsters, find items on brutalized dead people, befriend some people, be fooled by them, also with combat for monster bosses. Scary. Funny.

One Tip: The doors can be tricky, so make sure they are actually locked

And this game is better than showing the VR player in the trailer. Will never understand why they do that","Jan 9, 2021 at 11:20 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:16:18.526364,RuneSR2,A VR Reference Titel,"This is an adventure game. Sure there are some horror moments, but you can easily find much more scary games. Don't let the horror aspects keep you from trying this gem, especially if you love adventure games.
Graphics are really never seen better. Alyx is hard to beat, but Wilson's Heart bows to no one. Using Rift CV1, super sampling 2.0 and highest possible in-game graphics settings, I got solid 90 fps or very close using an oc'ed GTX 1080. Many surfaces on walls and ceilings simply look real. Reading a comic book in-game also just felt real. The attention to details on npcs might not be the same as Olivia in Lone Echo, but it's close. And the story is amazing - which also supports immersion. 
In short, do not miss out on this game - it's one of the finest VR games ever made.","Oct 26, 2020 at 6:02 AM",5, 50,

I will admit that although each combat is unique and fun, they do last a little too long, but that is like my only complaint for this game, which speaks to how well-made it is. Side note, the game is perfect for those who want to try story, puzzles, combat, and scary stuff without the motion sickness that other games in that genre tend to have. Really enjoyable and well-made.","Dec 3, 2020 at 5:27 AM",5, 6,

Mostly however — it just holds your hand,  through so so puzzles, has just ok writing and really unforgivable controls for 2020.

The worse thing though.  Is it’s terrible mind numbingly bad ‘combat’.

2022-05-28 13:16:28.001334,XtremeHardcoreGamer,What a spectacle!,"As far as graphics and presentation goes, this game is top notch. The artistic vision is well realized, the set pieces are well detailed and time appropriate, and the action- is simple, but immersive. Yeah- the locomotion feels dated but there is a charm to it. The voice acting is hands down among the best in VR. For the first time, the protagonist's voice didn't irritate me. Peter Weller was an awesome choice. (For young folks, Weller played Robocop and Buckaroo Banzai.) I was really entertained by this game. I recommend it. Wait for a sale but we know how sales go on the Oculus store. Few and not enough discount. I bought at full price when it came out and just beat it now in 2020. Should've beat it sooner.

One nitpick is the game's design doesn't seem to realize how hard it is to read small text in VR. Perhaps higher res headsets than CV1 will be better in text clarity.","May 4, 2020 at 6:17 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 13:16:31.147993,Edigs,Great VR classic!,"Another VR classic that stood the test of time.

There's a lot to like: graphics look amazing on Rift S. Very sharp visuals, great characters, good dialogues and interesting story. Oh, and it's all in black and white! I was worried lack of colours will make visuals boring after a while, but it didn't. It looks awesome and it feels like you'd be in an old monster movie.

Gameplay is great as well. Puzzles are not hard, but what sells the experience are hands interactions. In a way those are puzzles on their own. You can see devs really tried to bank on back-then-novelty of having hands in VR and the game keeps surprising you with the ways you can interact with your hands. The most important thing though: it still works and feels fresh and original even 3 years latter.

The only part of the game that kind of disappoints are boss fights. Bosses look great and the fights are actually puzzles: you need to figure out the successful pattern. The problem is, once you figure this out, it's not challenging anymore, but you still need to repeat it over and over again. It's not a big problem and it's still fun, but it would be better if you'd only have to figure out a pattern and be done with he boss and not repeat it 3 or 4 times.

Despite this small criticism, I was absolutely enjoying the game and can't recommend it enough!","Mar 31, 2020 at 10:20 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:16:31.164456,DrOculusVR,Really well done,"To think this game was made 3 years ago they do things that people even to this day cant get right and they do it so well. 

The voice cast is amazing and the game plays a little like a horror movie. You will likely have a few scares and there will be the odd occasion you miss something on a puzzle and pull your hair out too, but mostly you should be ok. There were a few parts in the game that the controls didnt quite work but only 1 that was very frustrating, all i'll say is ""the lift"" 

All in all great game that i intend to show my friends not quite 5 start but better than 4 and 4.5 isnt an option. totally worth your time and money","Mar 17, 2020 at 4:26 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 13:16:31.195374,Comrade_Ivan,Massive disappointment,"I tried playing this have twice now. Both times I spent about an hour and both times I felt it was a waste of time. 
Don't get me wrong, the game looks amazing, but that's just about all there is to it. Movement is the worst implementation of teleportation yet - find a shadow of yourself standing at a prescribed location and press a thumbstick. No free locomotion, no thumbstick turning, and you can't even lean more than a foot from the prescribed spot without pausing the game.
Also jump scares are a cheap way to get someone's heart rate up. Quality horror titles use suspense. Not this game.
Interactivity is limited to random objects, and bad at that too - tried to break the glass to get the fire extinguisher with my hands a dozen times, but they kept floating through the glass. Were it not for my sister who said to try to punch it really hard, I'd still be standing there.

2022-05-28 13:16:34.362482,SparkyNinja1583,Enjoyable but wait for a sale.,"I did enjoy this game but, I'm glad I got it on sale. 

The graphics and details are really good. The voice acting for everyone is also very good. The controls didn't bother me but may bother some (teleporting to specific locations only and contantly having to hold the 'reset view' button). The puzzles weren't hard but, it was still fun solving them. The gameplay was hit or miss. It got a little frustrating at times but, not so bad that I wanted to stop playing the game. The only things I didn't care for were a lot of the ""battles"" were a little bland and the story seemed like they tried to cram in a lot of stuff without explaining much. Some of the cut scenes and dialog from the characters were laughable but, a lot of this is subjective.

I personally didn't find it very scary but, I rarely get scared at video games (although some of the scenes get pretty graphic and are pretty creepy)!

I'd say trust your gut and if you think you'd like this one give it a shot! There's certainly much worse VR titles out there than this one.","Feb 8, 2020 at 11:26 AM",4, 4,

Combat and other mechanics are frustrating. There are few if any real puzzles, most of the game is spent wandering between rooms collecting items in a fully prescribed order; it won't let you go to the next place or do anything at all unless you've already got the items up to that point, and it restricts this down to a micro level (move by move).

2022-05-28 13:16:50.168321,Tytonium,Underwhelming,"I'll just go through my positives and negatives of the game. At the end of the day though, I'd say the game is overpriced for what it offers.

POSITIVES
* It has an OK story. Much better than most games of this time. This is honestly the best part of the whole game. Any scene you are in when interacting with characters is interesting because of the dialogue. If you are looking for a VR game solely for a good story, it isn't a bad choice.
* Good visuals. I don't think I ever once thought the visuals were lacklustered through my playthrough

NEGATIVES
* It offers a 10 hour experience and I beat it in 5 (and I took my sweet time with it)
* Teleportation to get to where you need to go BUT severely limited (as in you can only teleport to highlighted spots)... This is likely because-
* The puzzles can sometimes be very arbitrary and you are basically teleporting to find the shiny highlighted object on the map in order to progress.
* The boss fights. Oh God the boss fights. So basically boss fights are a puzzle and you have to figure out how to stop a boss from attacking you, sometimes with very unintuitive ways. This can lead to some frustration as you have to watch boss entrance animations over and over again until you figure out what to do. Once you figure out what to do, the rule of three hits applies to the bosses. So you have to solve the puzzle you know how to easily solve now 3 times and this can take forever. You basically just sit down in a chair and move your hands around to solve the puzzle for 5 minutes over and over again until it's finally dead. Not very fun.
*This is not a horror game unless your scare tolerance is that of thinking apples are inherently terrifying. Of course the few jumpscares will getcha, I mean of course they will as you are in VR and they are a cheap form of scare tactics. If you came here looking for a genuinely horrifying mood (think Dead Space, Aliens, or The Thing) then you will be very dissapointed. It Has mood of self aware comedy.","Apr 10, 2019 at 9:21 AM",2, 8,

2022-05-28 13:16:53.317021,Ikon_,It was a good ride!,"There's a couple of jump scares in the beginning and few more later, but it's not exactly horror, perhaps more of a supernatural mystely thriller.

In the game you solve puzzles, follow the progression of the intense story and fight all kinds of enemies. Each fight is against unique enemies and fight style and tools changes constatly. To be honest, i hated some of the fights more than windows 10 updates. Too often triggering or throwing something just fails somehow. Early vr era problems. Give it 5 years.

You move by teleporting to preset locations and if you wander off your spot, the game blurs everything and stops time. It left me a bit frustrated sometimes, because of course i wanted to look at things closer.
The voice acting, modeling, and environmets are great, but near the end the animation started to feel rushed.

The game doesn't seem to hog performance and looks great!

2022-05-28 13:16:53.334973,NotaHumanResource,Great Game with some a downsides,I am a horror fan and love old black and white horror movies.  This is basically a walk through puzzle game with a strong mystery story narrative. You walk foreward by teleporting.  The story and graphics are emersive and I played it straight through in two days (approximately 6 to 8 hours).  The downside is the combat scenes which drag on way too long. I had to look up how to defeat several of them online just to continue game play.  When you die your character groans each time which gets old.  This game is worth the play through but like most walk through narrative games it has minimal re-play value.

2022-05-28 13:16:56.508594,Florayne45,So close to being truly epic,"I will say that this game is well produced and is quite the VR story telling horror experience. The visuals and audio are on point, and the touch controls work wonderfully with the design. Overall the game is wonderful, but there is one key  reason I can't give it a higher score: The Locomotion. In this game you teleport between pre-determined locations which is not unheard of in VR titles, however, they force a different orientation each time you are teleported. For example, if you are facing forward and teleport to a doorway ahead in a hallway, once you teleport you are no longer facing forward- you are facing sideways (if the silhoutte was facing sideways.) This is incredibly jarring and really pulls you out of the immersion you may have been feeling before. Had they decided to let you teleport and maintain the direction you were already facing this would have been much smoother, but them forcing you to rotate every time you teleport is a bit frustrating. (I played with a 3 sensor 360 tracking setup) Also, if you try to look at the scenery around you and take  a step away from the center of your play space, the game pauses until you reset your position. This is a shame as the level design was brilliant and you want to take it all in naturally- but are forced to stand in place essentially. This game is great if you can get past the locomotion, but for me it really took a lot away from the experience.","Nov 22, 2018 at 1:00 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 13:16:59.668741,lefthome,"Amazing atmosphere and acting, has flaws","This is quite a well produced piece of entertainment. The voice acting is very well done (except for Peter Weller's death scream - they must have got that one on his way out the door). The characters are enthralling and the scenery and music is wonderful. 

The setting really captures the creepiness and there are a few jump scares, but overall there is a suspense and tension that keeps you anxious and uncomfortable.

There are a couple of aspects to the 'game' portion that make it a little less enjoyable and pull you out of the story. A lot of the 'boss fights' rely on you figuring something out relatively quickly without much prompting, and it can be a little bit of trial and error. Unfortunately the way they executed these fights is you die, fade to black, try again. Over and over until you hit upon what the designers want you to do. There was one fight where I must have died 20 times. They trained me to use a device (type of weapon) in one fashion, then expected me to use it in a completely different fashion in the middle of the fight. It becomes a little nauseating looping over and over and hearing the protaganist's half hearted death scream.

There are also some clunky mechanics in the game involving manipulating objects like keys and doors. I think we have come a long way with regards to object manipulation since this title was released (reviewing it in October 2018). The puzzles are not particularly hard, usually there is not much guessing as your inventory serves up the object you need at the appropriate time. This is best described as an interactive movie with puzzles/fights.

All in all, I would say I enjoyed the story and characters more than enough to compensate for the flaws I experienced.  Some people might be sharper and not have to die as many times as I did before they get it right. 

The voice acting really shines and brings the story to life. Overall it is a wonderful experience. Even the end credits are entertaining. Play if you have the chance.","Oct 4, 2018 at 10:48 AM",4, 9,

I've never really gotten jump scared in a game before this, I think it worked because I was really ""into"" the game. The game movement of exploring rooms with jump cuts reminded me of the original resident evil games when you walk through doors. Standing in darkness waiting and listening to creepy sounds adds to the intensity. I also surprisingly enjoyed stopping and reading through the comics/books/newspapers in the game I just wish the lighting in those areas was better because I was often hunched over uncomfortably trying to get just the right angle.  I only got stuck on a few areas, so I never felt too frustrated to wuity. I do wish the boss matches were a bit more dynamic but that was just a minor issue.

Where Loney Echo's big leap forward from this earlier release is the free motion and complete interaction with the environment, this game limits the interactive environment my teleporting to a set number of fixed positions, making this a more linear experience. After playing Loney Echo (5 stars), I went back to try other story type games (Obduction, Invisible Hour), but I like the movie type feel of Occulus Studios, compared to the pure puzzle like feel of the other developers.

2022-05-28 13:17:06.039907,Kryllic,Great game!,"This is a really great game, especially if you're into 40's horror monster movie genre, which I absolutely am! The story isn't the ""best"", but's still engaging enough. The characters are pretty good, developed enough to like them.

The gameplay, at first, wasn't entirely what I was expecting. I'm used to VR games having some sort of free movement, ala Lone Echo and From Other Suns. In this game, you can only teleport to select spots, so there's really no ""free roaming"". But, once I managed to get through that little quirk, I was really able to engage in this game, and it's rather interesting what you can find and interact with. And at some point early on, you get a neat device that has multiple functions (I won't spoil much, but it is pretty fun to use). 

There are a couple reasons this isn't getting a 5 star, depsite the very positive view I have of this game. One of the main reasons, is the game sometimes doesn't have much context. Meaning, there were points where I wasn't sure what to do or where to go, because the game never made it clear. For example, there's one part early on, where you're meant to close these steamer doors and lock them. I was able to close them, and I tried turning the bar to lock it, but nothing really happened. I tried wandering around, and couldn't figure anything out. Turns out, you need to use *both* hands to lock the door, and the game in no way clues you into that, you're just meant to figure it out on your own somehow. It's not often, but stuff like this does appear throughout the game.

The other reason, is because I feel there was a bit of lost potential with the fun device I mentioned earlier. Although it is a really neat thing to use and is pretty fun using it, you're only able to use it in very pre-determined events, like when enemies appear, or when a certain event occurs. Setting up the game in a way where you can use the device whenever you want would've definitely benefited a lot, but sadly it was a missed opportunity.","Jul 27, 2018 at 12:36 PM",4, 5,

If you do fail, it restarts to far back and you just do the same thing over and over again. I would not recommend this game","Aug 4, 2018 at 2:29 AM",2, 3,

As you get further into the story, the theme starts to really make sense and you'll find that Wilson is a fun guy to be in a insane nightmare hospital with. Objects are easily interactive and the characters and voice acting are great. 

Fantastic game I absolutely recommend. I played for a six hour session at one point because I  got so into it and as far as I was concerned i WAS a middle aged sacarstic man with a paranormal crazy ball where his heart should be.

It's an enjoyable game that has a decent story and a wonderful atmosphere. Wilson's Heart limits your freedom by giving you choices on where to move and what actions are allowed. However, this never made the experience feel any less enjoyable. The fight scenes in this game are a bit too easy and the complexity of the puzzles are mediocre. Although this game lacks complexity and the freedom to move about in a locomotive fashion, it's unique enough in the library of VR games to warrant its place as a must-have game. It's a beautiful game with some jump scare moments and an enjoyable, easy to predict story. I truly had a lot of fun with this title and I believe it's worth buying.","Jun 19, 2018 at 12:46 AM",5, 3,

There are some small drawbacks; no free movement (it wouldn't work anyway though, but feels limiting), and the ""fights"", though fun, feel gimmicky.

2022-05-28 13:17:24.997381,Kevin_Brook,"Not perfect, but enjoyable horror romp","This game is definitely one of the prettiest and most atmospheric VR games I've played so far. It's basically an interactive horror movie where you solve various puzzles to progress through the rooms of a sinister hospital, with all kinds of ghostly goings on. The story captivates and certainlly compells you to continue further. The acting is first rate, with Peter Welller being the real star as the aponymous hero of the story, I laughed out loud several times through the game, and jumped out of my skin on occasion too. It's not really scary, but there enough uncomfortable moments to make you always a little on edge. The game holds your hand to a certain extent with the puzzles, always pulling the correct objects out of your inventory and highlighting anything that needs interacting with. This will frustrate some, who yearn for more freedom, but even when you are given these large clues, you still have to figure out exactly how to perform the appropriate actions, as there is an awful lot of inventive ways to use the Oculus Touch controls in this. My only gripe with the game is that it forces to you remain in a tiny playspace, blacking out the screen and freezing the action, if you so much as lean forward too far. I don't know why they decided to implement this, I've never experienced such a system with any other VR game before. It's also worth noting the game uses teleportation as a mechanic too. Personally I love teleportation. I'm a little susceptable to motion sickness and I also find pushing a joystic to move clunky and unnatural in virtual reality. I just see teleporting as a transition to a different cut scene like you'd have in a movie. This experience is closer to a movie than a traditional game anyway so it works well in my view. I know some hate the old teleport mechanic however, seeing it as big a breach of their freedoms and liberty as Republicans do any challenge to their second ammendment rights to own a machine gun so I'll just say caveat emptor.","Mar 4, 2018 at 7:57 AM",5, 6,

This game takes full advantage of VR experience and the puzzles and interaction between objects and characters will grab your atention and keep it there. VR can take the mundane and make it magical and Wilsons Heart takes this to another level. My only issue (and it's minor) is that this is a point and click to move type of  game but the game play, attention to detail and storyline are woven together so well that it's easy to forgive and suspend any disbelief. I have been playing this intermittently for about  two weeks. I can see how someone with  more time on their hands could easily get sucked in and play streight through but I will say game play is surprisingly long compared to other oculus games. The  eye candy noir alone is enough to make this my favorite occulus game. If you like suspense and horror with a 50's slant, do your self a favor and just buy this game.

This is a really fun game with a satsifying amount of content. It's definately the best looking game I have played so far on the Rift - and it ran REALLY well on my GTX 970 and i7 2700k (upgraded to different specs mid playthrough but couldn't see a lot of difference in this game).

When you meet other people in this game, I was mind blown. It's something else to meet a NPC that is in your size, staring you into your eyes.

The only thing that drags the score down a notch is that I think that the quality of the scenarios and the ""scripted solutions"" decrease a bit when the game progresses. The further I got into the game, the more I was frustrated when I couldn't solve a problem the way I felt was a lot more logical than the main character.

Set in 1940's hospital it is absolutely dripping with atmosphere and the environment feels so authentic and detailed.  The black and white graphics actually suit the game perfectly and works better than colour would have done.

It's scary but more down to the atmosphere rather than cheap jump out at you scares (though there are one or two of those).

Despite the 5 stars there are issues with the game.  You are largely led through the puzzles rather than having to work things out for yourself - for example the item you need to use pops up in front of you which essentially gives the puzzles away and items you need to interactive with glow. When I did get stuck it was largely down to not seeing something rather than not be able to work something out or not visiting one location before my current one.    

Your movement is restricted to jumping around set points in the scenes which adds to the feeling of being led through the game.

Little details such as comics and radio boradcasts drive home the 40's/50's horror movie vibe. This game had the potential to scare me to death, but it's actually pretty light on jump scares. Mainly, it really drives home how terrifying a game like Resident Evil or Dead Space would be in VR. I only had a few issues. 1) Boss fights can be repetitive. 2) You need a ceiling high enough for full throwing motion. 3) Interactions with other objects are often pretty choppy, and it's often not clear where the game wants you to put your hands.","Dec 29, 2017 at 2:03 PM",4, 3,

The characters and the story are quite interesting in my opinion and I found myself laughing outloud at some of the well timed dark humor. Unfortunately, there are some negative elements that detract from the game. First, interaction is extremely limited in this game and sometimes a bit frustrating. if you lean too far one way or the other you go ""out of focus"" so you have to make sure you stay planted in a tiny space for each scenario to maintain immersion. Furthermore, most of the objects in the environment can't be interacted with which is quite disappointing and again breaks the immersion.

It is also amongst the finest SDGs I have played in recent years, period. The characters are classic without being riddled by deja vu, and likewise the enemies are familiar, but still feel exciting while they come at you (bugbosssofun). The environment of the game was very appealing to me, reminiscant of Silent Hill and Layers of Fear, but with a more varied content supporting the age-old context. I do have one problem with the game... Whilst most of the gameplay was clean, fun and a great way to show off the different playstyles of VR, there were a couple which were kind of annoying and seemed not to offer enough fulfillment upon completion to outway their tediousness. In particular there is a point where you must throw an object from your palm, around an enemy, to strike a target behind them. This was rather frustrating, not all that clever and if I had had even a tiny bit less space to lean and side-step I do not know if I could have completed the battle without a great many tries. Also, I would personally have liked the fights to be much harder in terms of enemy speed.

The controls are easy to figure out, inventory system is simplified as to not get in the way of the story. And that's the best part, there is a great story, not just a shooting game. The graphics are great IMO, and the voice acting is top notch.

The only thing I didn't like is the throw mechanic, just seems to not work correctly. You will get about 7 hours of play, and replay is not very high as once you figure out the puzzles you can't exactly forget them. But definate a must have.","Jan 14, 2018 at 9:17 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:17:34.546705,Slick1984,Love the feel!,"The setting is perfect for this type of game. Actually, it's more like an interactive movie. It does take some time to get used to moving around and spotting what it is that they want you to pick-up/use. But, be patient and work it through. I love black & white horror movies and this put me right in one. The puzzles aren't too hard, but again some can be difficult because I missed something and had to go back and look around more. The voiceovers are very well done and the story isn't too fast paced. You can do things at your own pace and not be forced into an arcade game. The controls are a little janky, but not too bad. Overall, a very good atmospheric thriller. There is more to VR than wave shooters.

MANOCHANG - This is not, was not and will not advertise itself as a fighting game. IT IS an atmospheric puzzle game set in a 1940's Horror Hospital. Yes, there is light physical activity at times. It was released in 2017, so your trying to apply 2020 VR logic to it, is mind-numbingly wrong.  

I think you are  a person that has lofty expectations and if not met, it's trash. I suggest that you lower all expectations to middle of the road and adjust them up or down according to your experience at that time, not before. You will find life to be much more livable. Don't be angry all the time. The world is not here for you, you are here for the world. Be kind.

However, my primary problem with the game is how uninspired and repetitive a lot of the fights end up being.  There's a lot of 'do X, then Y, then X again, then Y again, then one more time, then you win.'  It ruins the pacing of the game and mistakes force you to repeat cutscenes and deaths so that the enemy stops appearing frightening.

This is a great game with plenty of originality and style. It's not frustrating like so many other VR titles. Having said that, it is a little glitchy and it's annoying that sometimes when you take off your headset, the game just closes back to Oculus menu.","Jan 10, 2018 at 9:50 AM",3, 2,

The greyscale (essentially black and white) environment is unique and seems to keep the authentic feel of being inside a 1940's thriller movie, but doesn't take away from the immersive feel.  The fight scenes do drag a little.  You pretty much have to beat every opponent 3 times, doing the same thing all three times.  Probably an attempt to make the game a little longer since in my opinion it is a little short natively, although not in the extreme.  Also, the strong language seemed a bit out of place much of the time.  I think it was thrown in there to make it feel a bit more edgy in the 40's environment, but didn't usually feel appropriately timed.","Jan 8, 2018 at 3:40 AM",4, 1,

The programmers did a phantastic job by creating goosebumps not by simple splatter shocker, but more by smart playing with the fear. The b/w picture brings a lot into the immersion. And there are many small things you relize later, like when you talk to a person, their eyes are following you.

It honestly scared me quit a bit to the point to where I was nervous hoping back in. At first I wasnt into the non open world movement (teleporting), but once you get past scaring yourself with your own shadow haha it actually fits this game style very well. It really does bring some heart pumping thrills, but that was one thing that I noticed fell off was the thrills. Once I finished the game I was able to take a step back and realize that the first maybe 2 hours of the game was actually the most thrilling. After that it kind of became very preddictable and easy. Doesnt mean that the first half or second half was lackluster, it was all very intense and immersive just kind of died down after a while. The main thing that kind of took me out was the lack of creative boss fights. The bosses themselves where unique and had their own theme however, to defeat them was all the same like an old Mario game. Hit them 3 times after they do some very monotoned pattern, then repeat ect. ect. At times it seems like the voice acting was very monotoned and not in that intensive thriller moment, almost laughable at a few moments. Other than that It was a gorgeous horror thriller that had me wanting more, and hope there is more! Good luck and definetly worth the money. What an experience!","Dec 23, 2017 at 12:34 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 13:17:47.197589,FastLawyer,Best $10 spent on Oculus Store,"Wilson's Heart is not perfect, but it is currently the best story game experience out there.  The story is well-crafted from beginning to end, with lots of twists and turns along the way with a satisfying ending and a mysterious beginning.  It plays like a good horror mystery should.  With just the right pacing and getting to know each of the main characters.  Wilson, the protagonist, is the biggest mystery up until the very end where we see how this ol' crumudgeon is really a kind spirit.  I loved the black and white aesthetic and the great character modeling and development.  Elsa, Bela, Lucy, and Kurt are all memorable characters, each with their own hidden pasts.  As I mentioned, the game is not perfect.  There are problems with some game mechanics, almost every boss fight ends up being repetitive (have to do the same thing 3 times).  The locks can be annoying to open (not because of difficulty, but because of game bugginess).  The teleportation can be off putting for some.  However, the great atmosphere and story really shine and really overshadow the frustrating moments.  I immensely enjoyed the experience and thus can forgive the missteps.  Especially with the high production values and the quality and quantity of content here.  Rating 9/10.  *** Spoilers for avoiding frustration *** 1) at the start, you must find the key in the restroom and then put the key in the outlined area in the upperight hand corner of the screen to progress 2) keep trying the lock, you'll see it working when the animation shows the steel bar stand up 3) you can flip through some notebooks and that is vital for one particular puzzle 4) for some puzzles, keep holding on to the object and look around and you'll see where to go 5) watch the end credits for a final cut scene ****","Nov 16, 2017 at 11:32 AM",5, 5,

That's a bold claim of course but I think it's fair. Look at the Voice actors involved, Peter Weller, Rosario Dawson, Alfred Molina (Doc Oc in Spiderman) and others that I forget... The game is fantastic! Sure, I'd prefer full and free motion and the way you do actually move in game more or less points you in the right direction, but it does work. Graphics are top, 10/10, even if they are Greyscale. I know what the devs were going for with that look.
Anyway, I could write a novel on how good this is but no one would read it :-)

The game is a AAA title and if you stay until after the credits roll you might get a surprise and hopefully that means a Wilson 2.

Just enough Jump scares, great story and a great deal of fun!! Twisted pixel have done a great job!
***PRO TIP***

2022-05-28 13:17:47.250447,SwashBlade,No cheap scares here,"The voice acting in this game is fantastic and the VR implementation, while not allowing for free movement, is still mostly flawless.  I had a few niggles with stepping out of place to open a drawer or get better light to read a newspaper and having the game pause and fuzz out until I got back into the correct position, and needing to physically turn around to find places I could investigate meant I often had to untangle myself, but those are minor hassles.  The horror themes are pretty light by today's standards, borrowing heavily from the horror classics of the early days of cinema for tone and content.  The puzzles are for the most part intriguing and decently intuitive.  Combat is a little less exciting, often becoming repetitive by the time the third and final iteration of a particular fight scene is up.  Sometimes it's unclear exactly what you're supposed to do to win a fight - in some fights you can block with your fists while in others you need to hold nearby (and just out of field of view) objects as a shield.  The story itself decently ties together the locations and puzzles and Wilson's internal monologue tended to match the tone, if not the theme, of my own thoughts.","Dec 11, 2017 at 7:55 PM",4, 1,

Still amazed by the clarity of the fine print on some of the packages and printed material. I went into the game with no expectations and got a feast of entertainment. There were some moments of frustration figuring out a few things but most of the experience is intuitive. The only downside is the simple and repetitive nature of the boss fights. Though each one is a unique battle, several felt like a mechanical chore. Most bosses are minor parts of the game and just function as little chapter climaxes in the increasingly bizzare overall story. This isn't a game that's about the boss fights, this is a game about feeling like you are literally inside The Twilight Zone.","Dec 13, 2017 at 3:23 PM",5, 1,

While I dislike teleportation in any VR action based game, the teleportation method used here is as quick and convenient as it gets, and this game being more adventure then action I'd even say that free locomotion would do it more harm then good, because the teleportation nodes keep your attention focused where it needs to be. If anything these guys have set the bar to how well designed the Touch mechanics of a (non action based) game can be, both maximizing Touch related potential while minimizing Touch related frustration. It's not that you will find those Touch mechanics amazing, it's just that they do such a great job of fitting in instead of getting in the way of what you want to do (for performing advanced VR interactions that go beyond holding and pointing a gun), that it's easy to forget about them and how well they work.

You can only move to predetermined locations in an area and interact with items that are useful for progressing the plot.  Within each of these locations you can only move about one foot in any direction before the game pauses and waits for you to go back to your ""interaction point"".  This cheapens the experience and kills any feeling of immersion.  The combat is Janky at best and can become extremely frustrating.  Most scenarios come down to figuring out what part of the monster or environment you need to interact with, then doing it three times per ""boss"".

2022-05-28 13:18:09.472290,MTLion3,"Flawed, But Worthwhile","Wilson's Heart is, as the review title suggests, a tale that is well worth your time. The locale, puzzles, and characters draw you in and stay varied enough that you won't get bored over the course of your 8ish hours. The game has some good scares, but they aren't a focus - the asylum's creepy atmosphere and bizarre encounters fill in all the spooky gaps well enough by themselves. 
The game's flaws from the ""combat sections"". They suffer from 2 major issues. Repetition and being oft unclear as to how to combat your foes. 
Repetition comes in the form of boss fights that are split into parts. These parts generally consist of an up-close and a far-away bit of combat that essentially repeat themselves at least 3 times with very little variation to make them more interesting... More just to fluff the game's play time.
As these fights can be fast paced and sometimes involve the world around you, sometimes the solution to the fight is frustratingly obtuse. This forces you to replay the same bit over and over again until you figure out what you're supposed to do and just want the fight to be over. Gaining new ""heart powers"" became something I dreaded because it usually meant a fight was coming up.
Combat aside, the puzzles were (with some minor exceptions) engaging, interesting, and made sense. The story had some good twists and mostly decent voice work. Side things like radios and comic books provided fun distractions from everything else going on and sometimes gave context to the characters and world around you. 
In conclusion, Wilson's Heart is a step in the right direction for puzzle based VR titles. Combat isn't great, but isn't a major focus and had some interesting points. This is a must play for VR enthusiasts and hopefully an inspiration for future titles to learn from.","Oct 31, 2017 at 7:53 AM",4, 1,

I have some minor complaints about teleportation (played in 360 mode) because the teleportation arrival position is reset on the position in which you were looking and this makes you keep rotating in the real space loosing the optimal sensor position.

My two-star rating goes towards the story and general ambiance of the game - both for the black and white horror set in the 40's as well as the music and sound effects. I do not feel as positive however for the puzzles and gameplay style. It feels like this type of gamestyle is outdated for 2017 - similar to Sanitarium (released in 1998). You can only move to predetermind spots and within are a few interactive objects. Those related to the puzzles are outlined and the others can't be carried to be used/tried elsewhere anyway. Basically the puzzles are presolved for you and the game becomes only a ""search for the highlighted destinations and objects"" game. Little brainpower needed in what lasted me approximately 4 hours of gameplay. Replay value, for me at least, is inexistant. I think  TwistedPixel has potential to make greatness in future VR games though. They just need tougher puzzles, allow players to try anything at anytime in a free roam style and they have a recipe for a game of the year!","Oct 16, 2017 at 7:42 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 13:18:18.993059,Anomalous2141,Must. Have.,"I stayed away from this one for a while because I'm not a big fan of scary games in VR. I sound like a bit of a wuss saying that (and I cowered like one in Duck Season) but there it is.  Finally tried it and I am pleased to say, it's not that kind of scary.  Horror game?  Yes.  Violent images?  Sure thing.  Jump scares?  From time to time, but the overall feel of the game doesn't summon dread or terror.  There's a general sense of grim whimsy to the game that reminds me more of The 7th Guest in tone, though the puzzles are not as random and pointless and the story, you know, makes sense.  Mostly.  My only complaint about the game is the solutions to some puzzles work most of the time, and the game can feel like a bit of a cheat when you try the solution in trial-and-error and it doesn't work leading you to try numerous other solutions until you've gone around the horn, try the same thing a second time and then, somehow, get different results.  Last I check that's the very definition of insanity.  Of course, this game DOES take place in an asylum, and the checkpoint system is friendly so you don't get thrown back far when something goes wrong (Syren, take the hint).  Anyhoo, it's a long, engrossing and entertaining experience.  Get this game.  Do it now.  And stay away from Syren.  It's the worst.","Oct 15, 2017 at 2:56 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 13:18:22.111342,FPS_LK,,"The game has this horror theme for a reason, but personally I didn't find it even remotely scary (this includes the few jump scares they throw in). So if you're going into this game to get scared you won't. If you are going into this game for a gosh darn pretty decent story with puzzle aspects to it then go for it. It is a good game and I found the Teddy bear to be pretty funny.

It's not free movement though. It's teleport to places the developers want you to teleport to. This isn't a bad thing because it let's you sit down as there is a lot of standing in this game and your knees just get tired.

The boss battles were well made but they got kind of repetitive. Once you know what to do you have to do it a few times with no changes to the boss fight.

2022-05-28 13:18:22.148244,Assassin13579,One of the best VR games out there,"I'm only an hour into the game and I already know this is one of the best VR games currently on the market. Everything about this game is fantastic; the graphics, the sound, the monochrome design, the immersion, the acting (your character actual talks a good amount), the writing, and just about everything else. This game takes full advantage of the touch controllers in that you will literally do anything you can think of; move a cart, release yourself from shakles, pickup a clip board in order to read the controls for the game, and even strike a match. Now that may all sound boring but anyone who has played VR can tell you that even that stuff is amazing. The game itself takes place in a hospital and, to put it bluntly, bad stuff has happened. You wake up all alone with blood seen on hospital beds with nobody in sight and you set out to find out what is going on. I can't go into detail about the story since I just started and game and even if I had beaten the game I wouldn't spoil it but the story is very good in my opinion. The game has a horror vibe and a few jump scares; whether intentional or not. And some really creepy stuff happens. You move around the world by looking for silhouettes of yourself and pointing at the figure to go to where the figure is. Once you are there you can interact with the world in order to progress onward. If you do happen to find something useful, you, literally, put it into your inventory. So no, there is no free movement but please don't let that fact stop you from playing a rich, immersive game. Virtual Reality is still young but with games like Wilson's Heart, the genre is sure to thrive. I honestly can't recommend this game enough so please look up videos on the game and give it a try; you won't be disappointed.","Oct 1, 2017 at 1:43 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 13:18:28.487016,SwirlyMaple,The visuals are truly a work of art,"I really enjoyed this experience. This game is easily in my top 3 most visually-impressive VR games yet. I found myself staring in awe at the rooms and environments around me on numerous occasions, and could tell that the artist(s) behind this game really poured their heart and soul into it. Even if the gameplay was trash, the visual aspect of this game alone could've launched it to 3 or 4 stars, for me. Before playing it I wasn't sure about the monochrome aesthetic, but I think in a way it really enhanced the immersiveness of the game, making you feel like you're trapped in an eerie 1950s Hitchcock thriller or Twilight Zone episode.

On the cons, I do wish the game offered free locomotion, if only to further explore the gorgeous world you're dropped into. However, the gameplay as it stands relies pretty largely on putting you into the right places, otherwise it would be very difficult and time consuming to try to figure out what to do next.  Even though you are constrained to specific places and vantage points throughout the game, I think the way this was handled worked really well and didn't detract much from the overall experience. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the combat mechanics felt like one of the weakest parts of the game, but it isn't a combat-heavy title either.

The story and audio are also worth a mention. This one drops you into a mystery you're trying to figure out as the game progresses, with a number of twists to keep it interesting. The voice acting in the game is great (it should be considering the list of pro actors in the credits), and the musical score fit the theme nicely too. I should also mention the humor scattered throughout this game, if you go looking hard enough for it... TPS reports anyone?

No game is perfect and this title isn't an exception to that rule, but I can tell they set out to make a truly cinematic experience with this game and I think they succeeded nicely. One of my most enjoyable VR playthroughs yet.","Sep 18, 2017 at 5:21 AM",5, 2,

The first was a terrible checkpoint system. Checkpoints are fine, but at least should tell the user when it was last saved. I constantly found myself trying to guess when it was saved so that I could end my gaming session. Often I actually played less as thought I had reached a milestone and didnt want to commit to the next part not knowing how long I would have to commit. Really should never have gotten passed QA.

The second main issue was the movement choice. I can certainly see why it was done, but the fact remains that nodal movement really reduces immersion. Just straight teleport would have been better. 

A small problem as goes to a truly horrific throwing mechanic (grenade scene). 

Looking forward to more from this dev in this area. A solid entry but if only to bookend what should be a bright future in this genre for VR","Aug 16, 2017 at 7:55 PM",3, 0,

Wow, What a disappointment!  The game leads you around by the nose and it is impossible NOT to solve the “puzzles” so this experience ends up being a simple click driven story.  This wouldn’t be so bad until you get to the “Boss” areas where some newbie of a game designer thought it would be fun to send wave after wave of the dull enemies at the player only to have them start at the beginning and repeat the same inane experience.  Someone needs to go back and take Game Design 101.  I stopped playing the game at that point – even the decent story can’t drive bad game play.
BTW – What is with all the lame comic books?  It looks like most of the art resources were spent on non-goal driven assets.","Jun 22, 2017 at 11:58 AM",2, 12,

The gameplay, on the other hand, is increadably clunky. Object interactions are often both unintuitive and inconsistent. The only way to move the story forward is to do EXACTLY the right thing, in the right order and only that order. You'll be helplessly flailing your arms mid air, hoping to grasp something of value, moving the story forward. Before it all is over you'll probably want to pull out your hair in frustration multiple times.

You have to kill monsters quickly with your heart (ball). After 20 attempts I stopped in frustration. So I'am stuck.

This game is good at suprising you even if you expect it.  The monsters are genuinely scary.  That is the good now for the bad.  Over and over there are objects that you can see but can not interact with. Also you can only teleport to specific area's and some of them only appear after completing specic actions.  Also be prepared to spend too much time searching for the one item or action you didn't do thats needed to continue. This breaks the experence.  The story is a mess and the ending is flat.  I honestly regret seeing the ending.  I wish I could have just made up my own.  It sucked that bad.  Lastly - the combat.  If you enjoy getting killed over and over and over just because you didn't get the movement and timing just perfect or the oculus didn't track you well - you get to do it all over again!  Here is the deal.  I WANT to love this game.  There are so many cool idea's, monsters and artwork but it simply doesn't mesh into a great game.  My advice - its not a bad game - just not as great as it should have been.  Grab it on sale and have fun just expect disapointment when you see the ending.","Jul 31, 2017 at 7:58 AM",3, 2,

The game is just over hyped don't waste your money until the dev fixes the horrible mechanics. 


Long version:
Great graphics and story which is destroyed by awful mechanics! It is so badly made at the beginning pushing the button on the desk lamp was a horrible experience! Almost everything you interact with is well designed and badly implemented
Why does everything respawns after I touch them!? I mean the book is there I JUST put it down exactly where it was before! You don't have to make it disappear and fall from the sky unless it's out of my reach ( which is many other titles do ).


Who thought it's a good idea to blur the whole thing just because I moved 20cm to the left or right!? You guys need some basic game design 101 ( it is ONLY acceptable to do this if the player goes through objects! )

Wilson's Heart is by far my favorite VR experience. The Oculus Touch controllers make it so much more immersive; at one point I even tried to set one of my controllers on a bench in the game because for a second I forgot I was in a game. I loved the characters and the story line. The bosses were all unique and fun to fight. I think the only complaint I had was with the gloves. There are two times during this game where you have to put on gloves to complete tasks and it took me forever to get it to work correctly. Just grabbing them didn't work, and I tried to use my other hands to help put them on (like you would real gloves), but that didn't work either. It took a lot of button pressing to get the gloves on. Maybe I was doing it wrong? I guess if there are certain buttons that need to be pressed, that should probably be made more clear in the game.

Many of the puzzles and scenarios are intriguing and creative, and make delightful use of the sort of dream logic that only works in a virtual environment. The art direction, environments and animations are extremely impressive and rank amongst the very best I’ve seen in any VR game.  The voice acting is great, with Rosario Dawson and Alfred Molina doing particularly good work. However, the game does have a few issues with unnecessary hand-holding (some harder puzzles would have been a good addition) and overly limited interactivity in some areas (why can’t I duck under things that get thrown at me?). The story is an interesting and entertaining mashup of horror movie tropes, but it would have been nice to see a clearer dramatic arc and more character development. I found the combat scenes fun, but I also felt they could have used a bit more variety. That said, given that this is one of the first VR productions on this scale I’m inclined to cut Twisted Pixel some slack here, as the VR industry as a whole is very much still in the “figuring things out” phase.

Some people say it takes 10 hours to beat but if you have lots of experience with adventure games this time boils down to about 5 hours.

So why 4/5 instead of 5/5? It's because of the ""boss fights"". They are the worst point of the game. Don't get me wrong - they ARE super fun and look GREAT, but they are too repetitive. 

I understand that developers followed ""rule of thirds"" and you have to beat same boss pattern 3 times to win, but they shouldnt make each of those patterns consist of 3 smaller patterns (making a total of 9 patterns to beat). Because of this repetition the last third (or even half) of each battle lose the emotional charge and ""oomph"" they originally had. You end up thinking ""oh comon...just die already"" instead of ""YEAH! I'M SUCH A BAD*SS"" like you did at the beggining of the fight.

There were shelves with books on it that I wanted to check out, but I couldn't. It's very frustrating this way. Like that donkey-carrot-stick-thing. Another VERY annoying thing for me right now is, when you take a step in each direction, leaving Wilson's invisible body, your vision gets blurred. I tried for several times to look at something a bit closer in front of me or to my right/left and my vision got blurred. Again, very frustrating and a total immersion killer. The game forces you to stand just in one spot like a pot plant and that is pretty hard for me when I'm immersed, I also have a 360 setup so I'm used to move around somewhat.

When the recipe is not followed you run the risk of losing a part of 4the audience. One of the ingredient that is expected by many is the freedom of movement. If you have no freedom you can't have a good game. It's VR and you should be able to go and explore everything, interact with everything, touch everything, break everything, eat everything, read all the books in the library, open all doors, etc. 

Well this game doesn't let you roam free all over the place and I like it. If I go to the beach to swim do I need to visit all the houses on my way to the beach? If I go to the fridge to get a snack do I need to explore the entire house before I get to the fridge?
Do I want to spent 25 hours exploring a room inches by inches or do I want the story to advance? In my case I want thing to move along, I want the story to unfold in front of me and I think this game does it very well.

The ingredients are different but the end result is very interesting and entertaining.

Graphics and models are quality with lots of nice details and textures but the character acting animations are strangley wooden. The story is absurd yet complete so I didnt feel cheated at the end, however it is very linear and the game is just a string of very simple puzzles to move the story along with a few easy and repetitve boss fights. I enjoyed it although it is a little overpriced as it was a really just an interactive experience with ocassional waving and no real replay value.","May 18, 2017 at 4:37 AM",4, 3,

The feeling of really be in this world, interacting with so different objects so naturally, talking to people that I really feel in front of me, all those things blew my mind. The gameplay is often renewed, with new abilities, new puzzles or even fights.  Grapically very nice, artistically very cool, I could't recommend it more. I would have liked free locomotion instead of teleport to planned point but that's ok, I guess that find out what to do in each room would have been maybe less clear for their kind of puzzles.","May 1, 2017 at 2:13 AM",5, 5,

The story is amazing and so is the gameplay.  I actually ended up quite liking the node based locomotion system. It lets you really play the game like an interactive comic book. Full locomotion would be welcome, but it is great as it is.

2022-05-28 13:19:19.416357,c741535,Interesting but flawed VR adventure,"I managed to dodge the hype around this and didn't know what to expect. tl;dr - This game is a good early lesson for VR developers, some things are great and others are horrible.

Pros - Graphically pretty despite the B&W asthetic. 
- Good voice acting and animations deliver fair feeling of 'being there'.
- Story is just weird enough to be fun without triggering face-palms.
- The comics are great.
- Physical mechics such as throwing, punching and interacting with objects are done quite well, mostly feeling natural.
- While most of the puzzles are super easy to solve (due to the heavily 'guided' nature of the gameplay) many are inventive and still fun to solve given the supernatural theme.
- Multiple save slots so others can enjoy while you're mid-game (not enough titles have this basic must-have so u can demo).

Cons - The 'boss' battles are largely dull, rinse and repeat affairs for the most part with occasionally wonky combat mechanics that will likely make many scream in frustration.
- The teleport system is the poorest implementation possible. Makes the gameplay feel more like a 2D LucasArts point-and-click than a VR game. 
- If you move more than 40cm from the central standing location the vision blurs and the game pauses. This simply destroys a VR game and there's no gameplay-breaking reason for it as far as I can tell.
-  I understand why they went with B&W, it supports the stories context, but I see in colour so it really pulls me out of 'being there'.
- The save locations are frustrating more often than not. You have no way of knowing when state is saved, no idea where the check points are. Jumping back in and having to re-play 10 minutes cos there was no save after major events is enraging.
- I am very tollerant of motion-sickness and other VR negative effects but for some reason this game makes my eyes tired quite quickly. I have about 60+ titles and none of them do this to me. I can play SuperHotVR or Elite for hours, not this game though.","May 9, 2017 at 2:23 PM",3, 2,

You'll want to grab this and that and you can't which does blow but it isn't really necessary if you look at the bigger picture. It does break some of the immersion I've learned to not mind it. What's here is quality VR.
A date night at the movies cost about the same thing as this and this is more worth it. You get to own a quality VR game which you can play a million times or show friends and family.

The developers have done a great job capitalising on VR and touch controls. The game is full of novel uses of touch controls that for the most part are intiutive.

Coupled with an intriging story and setting, this is closeset yet I've seen a game fullfil the potential  of VR. 

I felt the locomotion technique suited well to the genre, as you couldn't stray too far from the linear path, thus keeping the pacing up and the player in sync with the story beats.

My only critisims would be sometimes not knowing where to place your hands on interactionable objects, and the tight out of bounds (move out of it and the games stops).  Both issues can be disruptive and I feel better solutions could still be explored.","May 1, 2017 at 8:28 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 13:19:25.791526,Bookoo,,"The visuals and sound design in this game is great. The game is very well acted and has great voice acting.




My biggest complaint in the game is around the game play. 

Some of the interaction were really strict and just felt a little awkward performing them. Also the puzzles could have been a bit more creative. Many of them have you search around until you find an item and that item will allow you to perform a task at another node. However it highlights when that item is useable so it sort of gives it away.  I really enjoyed the puzzles in the painting section.

Another thing is that the boss fights are pretty simplistic and you basically cycle through 2 or 3 phases until you beat the boss.

Another frustration is that you die in a single hit which seems very unnecessary in a narrative focused game. For example, there will be some exposition going on and then a boss interaction happens. If you get hit, it restarts you have to watch the same 10-15 interaction and try again. It seems like it would make more sense to allow you to take 2-3 hits to get your bearings. I noticed this a lot towards the end and it just killed the momentum of the final scenes.

The game took about 5ish hours I would say to beat, but I had seem some of the preview footage of the beginning.

Overall I enjoyed the game and hope to see more from Twisted Pixel.","Apr 30, 2017 at 3:53 AM",4, 2,

The game is beautiful, the environemnts are captivating and draw you in. The story is good, not outstanding, but good enough to get by. The mechanics will make you want bash your headset into the wall. Do you enjoy spending hours doing what you're supposed to but the game either not registering it, you haven't picked up the proper piece of info(even though you did read it, it's just not in your inventory), or blindly trying to figure fight mechanics while the game gives you nothing to go off of. Then when you figure out the fight mechanics repeating the same actions to kill the baddy 12 times for every fight. They're so repetive I heard Ubisoft is trying to buy the studio. /s


For example on agravating mechanics: There's 100 doors in this game to open. 99 of them you open by grabbing the handles in a typical VR fashion and opening them. 1 you open by standing 13 feet away and using a power to open. I would understand this if you had just learned that power, but no, it's about an hour and 17 doors after learning that power.","May 8, 2017 at 9:13 AM",1, 5,

The movement system could be better. I would like to room scale a bit, but it didn't take away from how awesome the game is. There are moments in this game that go way beyond what I have seen in another VR game. The use of Touch and some of the visuals will stick with me for a long time.","May 29, 2017 at 2:10 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 13:19:44.881089,Veraxus,Twilight Zone VR,"Oh. My. God. This game is amazing. First off, be aware that the gameplay is very much inspired by classic adventure games like Myst. The movement is node-based and the game deliberately funnels you through setpieces that remind me of the Tower of Terror ride at Disneyland. The black-and-white graphics somehow work brilliantly, and the game has some legitimate scares. My one complaint is the same I had when Robo Recall was launched... although the game encourages you to turn 360 degrees frequently, you aren't ever facing the ""correct"" direction when you jump between nodes. I'm sure it's designed this way for people with only 2 sensors... forcing you to reorient yourself every time you ""move"". It's a bit disorienting, but not in a good way. That aside, the game is absolutely dripping with brilliant VR ideas: a little Twilight Zone, a little Lovecraft, and oodles and oodles of creepy atmosphere, gorgeous visuals, and movie-quality storytelling. If the developers fix the movement system for people with 3+ sensors, this is easily 5 stars and the best VR game to date.","Apr 26, 2017 at 12:53 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:19:47.987911,Hanover,A Monster Movie Masterpiece,"Add a pinch of David Lynch, tiny bit of William S Burroughs,  a dash of Ed Wood, a sprinkle of The Twilight Zone, a handful of Kafka, and a little Love Craft.  Stir and serve it with some film noir.

I've never played a game as compelling and that is as brimming with atmosphere as Wilson's Heart.  Not only is it a great game, it's almost like you're the main character in a pretty good movie.

I'm docking a star for the boss fights that seem to never end.  There are also a couple of places where its way too much trial and error, with unskippable cut-scenes whever you error.   

This is one of the best VR experiences so far.  Don't miss it.","May 1, 2017 at 5:36 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 13:19:48.049745,westingtyler,,"The most full-featured, polished game currently on the Oculus Store. If you want to taste the potential of Rift with Touch and VR in general, this is the game.
===
Not having the ability to move around yourself, and not having an inventory you can manage yourself, reduces a LOT of puzzle-solving to 1) look around, 2) use a collected object when it appears in the corner of your eye. A little mindless, but the cool objects and machines you get to handle, helps make up for it. The node-based directional teleportation mechanic of Robo Recall, is just a straight-up improvement over movement here.
===
The game is more about puzzles than jump scares, but there are some good jump scares, and there's definitely some creepiness.
===
If you can get used to the restrictive movement and inventory, the game is REALLY satisfying from a story and artistic angle, ESPECIALLY if you love classic black and white horror movies.
===
Possible improvements for a patch (hopefully the devs read these): 
===
1) make the ghost avatars of the player, optional, with an option for some footprints instead, which would prevent damaging the sense of isolation and immersion.
===
2) enable an option that puts footprints on the ground where the player must stand, since there's no way to physically recenter yourself currently, without just stepping really far from your planted position, which causes the game to freeze in a super-immersion breaking way, creating a ghost avatar of yourself that people can actually get scared by when it appears. I had to put a patterned floor mat below me, to see out the bottom of the Rift, just to check where I was, which wouldn't be necessary if the game wasn't SO unforgiving about moving a foot or two to the side - or just had some little glowing footprints for me to move back to.","Apr 28, 2017 at 1:57 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 13:20:07.186672,Dr Greg VR,pretty dissapointed...updated,"update:  I have just finished the game and am going to bump it up one star to three.  If the locomotion would have been full and the game didn't spoon feed you all the puzzles it would have easily been a 11.  I will go through this again and will put my friends in and let them experience it because that is what it is.  More of an interactive experience/movie than it is a game persay.  But the story is fun.  and the production values are so great it is worth it! 

The production values of this game are fantastic.  Graphics, artistic style, character models, sound and voice acting.  Just amazing.  The gameplay how ever.  If you are simply going to point to a siloete (sp) of your character and teleport to the very limited areas that you can inhabit in this world, and then hardly be able to interact with anything and be spoon feed everything you need to do and have the 'horror"" element be reduced to cheap cliche jump scares.  You are really just involved in a glorified VR movie experience.  This terrible locomotion and lack of being able to do anything like Move from a very restrictive standing space completely destroys immersion in the story and takes away all suspence.   Simple games like Dread Halls are much scarier.  Paranormal Activity did it right.  the whole point to being in VR is to lose yourself in that world and this game with it's point and click style locomotion just kills that immersion.","May 5, 2017 at 6:18 AM",3, 25,

This game is very good, the puzzles are imgainitive and the story is well written. In someways it is better then my current favorite starseed. There are moments that actually freak me out and make me say OMG! 

I would not let the locomotion put you off. Yes you are limited to where you can go, but it is nice to know that you have something to look at in every location, anyone can play without getting sick, and it is quick. Would I rather have free movement, yes but I actually prefer this over free teleportation where I feel I am always trying to get the box in just the right area and where I constantly pick up everything only to waste my time.
