2022-05-28 19:45:25.676378,DemonSlayer12254816,"Awesome, Just One Thing","This demo is awesome.!  I'm excited for when its released fully and I can experience the open-world side of it!  However,  at random moments, the movement speed goes from normal to limping zombie, even if I'm just wondering around the base.  If that gets fixed,  this game would be worthy of a 5-star rating.","May 17, 2020 at 5:24 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:45:25.698319,Metalsech,,"Graphics functional - simple but stylish. Some glitchy stuff like vanishing zombies, but it is just a demo. Most irritating thing is the manual reloading of weapons, nobody needs this kind of fiddly nonsense in VR. You get caught out and eaten alive while fumbling around trying to put ammo in guns. And the shotgun only takes two rounds! Tip to devs - if you're trying to make this fun then simplify reloading.","Nov 8, 2019 at 2:36 AM",3, 7,"Thanks for your feedback! The game was just updated and you can now switch to 'Simplified' reloading (inside the settings menu). With this feature enabled, you can just drop your current mag and move the gun towards your body to reload - instead of inserting the mag by hand."
2022-05-28 19:45:25.718265,SamuraiWerewolf,Very good demo,I played through the demo and enjoyed the game play and style.  I am not the biggest fan of wave shooters so I am definitely looking forward to the open world content described by the Devs.  I really believe this will be a very enjoyable game once released.,"Nov 4, 2019 at 2:53 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:45:28.853471,Terragamer9,Movement,When a zombie gets close you just freeze. You cant move or reload,"Dec 9, 2019 at 5:42 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:45:28.869937,degradingpine47,Fun,The game is very fun(ish) reloading is BAD but its ok.,"Nov 9, 2019 at 11:36 PM",5, 1,Thanks for your awesome review! You should check out the newest update and enable 'Simplified' reloading inside your settings. This will make reloading much easier. Just drop your current mag and move the gun towards your body to reload.
