Hopefully, someone will create a ""Rome Reborn"" that you can walk through and explore; this is not it.","Jun 3, 2020 at 5:12 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 19:17:24.349666,PoolfanVr,Nice add on to Rome Reborn,"I purchased the original Rome Reborn and found it really interesting albeit disappointing in its application of VR.  This takes a section of Ancient Rome and goes into more detail.  As in the first Rome Reborn I found the graphics to be a little primitive but they serve their purpose, a little more work could be done on the scaling as it is not quite right.  As before, this is not a model where you can walk freely as in Google Earth VR but a series of VR stills that can be viewed from many different angles.   One key difference with this one is that you are not up in the air in your virtual balloon looking down but are now spending time at ground level mostly.  I enjoyed this more than the first APP as the developers have been able to provide more detailed graphics on the major structures and you are more up close and personal and able to see reliefs and statues in detail.

 There is an excellent Time Warp feature which overlays the graphics with a VR photo of where you are stood in Ancient Rome - a really good feature and found it fascinating.  As in the first VR APP, I found the commentary really interesting and clearly a lot of effort goes into this.  For anyone interested in Ancient Rome this is a very worthwhile purchase and good value.","Jan 4, 2020 at 7:12 AM",4, 3,"Thank you for this perceptive and detailed review. We appreciate it!
