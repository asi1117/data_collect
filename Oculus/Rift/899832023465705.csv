2022-05-28 16:41:11.321105,Stoneking,it's ummm.... bad,"look I don't like handing out 1 starts but this game is just broken. now before I start I want to say that the only good part is that you get a good scare in but at the same time, other have done the same and better. 

first the game is broken. you can pause the level to get throught the first night. ya.... not kidding and I think that the way to get throught the nights I don't know how to get the batties and with out them you can't win. 

the turning
why... just why? look making a video game is hard but when you mess up on turn... look in most games you turn like in real life. but here you move in a circle like if you want to look at something you messed it takes like three seconds. 

overall

fix the games please","Jul 2, 2020 at 4:16 PM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 16:41:11.378950,Justyn87,Okay game,"It's a decent game, but after so many nights it starts to get repetitive and boring. This game kind of reminds me of five nights at freddies, in that you must conserve your battery power and look in different areas for the enemy. I like how things change when you enter house mode to search for items you will use that night. I did not like how the left analog stick allowed rotation. I kept wobbling with smooth rotation on because I couldn't hold that stick perfectly upwards. I feel that the rotation control should be controlled by the right controller only for more percise control over the players movements.

The flashlight is positioned about 12 or so inches under my left controller and is usually clipped through the bed. I feel the flashlight should feel like it is in your hand and positioned where you are actually holding the controller. I spawn at the foot of the bed rather than the pillow part, is that normal? And 1 last thing, I am not able to move around once I am in my room, but I am assuming that is part of the gameplay and you are only meant to rotate while on the bed.

How many nights are in this game? Or is it endless?
All I see is a flashlight, am I suppose to have hands?","Oct 27, 2018 at 8:31 AM",3, 3,

If you are too low to the floor, re-start the game and make sure your oculus rift is at your current head level, picking it up from the desk etc will start the HMD origin far too low."

You can now also move the flashlight around using the touch."
2022-05-28 16:41:14.566425,tygreenway,Better than Expected,"For one of the cheaper VR games, this one isn't that bad. It's actually quite fun! The design is similar to five nights at freddys but different in other ways. The house exploration mode is pretty neat. Highly recommend this game for the current asking price. Only thing I would truly fix is the ability to explore darker areas in the house exploration mode. Finding the lightswitches can be tough, but definitely adds to the overall difficulty.","Dec 26, 2016 at 9:45 AM",5, 8,

After spending time in the room pointing your flashlight around, you do get to explore the house. Not that much content, so wait for a sale.","Jun 20, 2017 at 10:13 PM",3, 3,
