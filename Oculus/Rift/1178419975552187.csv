2022-05-28 16:59:09.279466,Turgrodan,Used to Work,"I played this on my older computer but now that I got a 12700KF CPU and RTX 3080 with Windows 11, it just crashes on load now.

Update: I found the solution on Reddit.  It has something to do with OpenSSL and newer generation CPUs.
Follow these steps:

Go to System --> Advanced System Settings --> Environment Variables (You might get to this differently in different versions of Windows)

In THE SECOND window (""System Variables"") click NEW

Enter name ""OPENSSL_ia32cap""

Enter value ""0x200000200000000""

Then click OK

You must REBOOT SYSTEM

When that fades out the screen is just completely black. I hear the audio of the game / music and I hear a voice telling me to choose from the menu items, but there is no video, just a black screen.

Would be even cooler if developers would simulate time passing (like rotation of the Earth, moon phases, seasons, aurora borealis etc.); currently both the station and Earth are stuck in the same position.

The app runs perfectly using super sampling 2.0 on my oc'ed GTX 1080 and i7 7700K. Textures are quite good, but not as good as Lone Echo - then again nothing is. Performing a spacewalk is breathtakingly beautiful - and the polygon-count outside the station may even be higher than Lone Echo ;-) For Rift owners this app is a must - note, you'll have to move just a few meters beyond the the two spacesuits to be allowed to exit the station and do a spacewalk (bring up your tablet computer and select existing the ISS, when you're standing in the right place - took me a few minutes to find out, sigh :-)","Sep 9, 2020 at 3:37 AM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 16:59:15.669375,DarkNRG,They arent going to simulate the world!!,"Of course the arent going to simulate the entire world, to do that they would need to needlessly sacrifice quality on the interior of the ISS. 

Now thats aside i have to say i was thrilled by this gem. im one of them people that even the tinest scientific inaccuarcy ruins movies, the only flaw i can see really is if you twist (two handed) off an object you were gripping onto you do not continue to rotate. other than that i had great fun flying about the interior of the ISS and the closest you will come to being in the thing.

having played it for 2 hours and seeing my young daughter play it (and do the spacewalk no problem too) i would have happily paid for this.

It would be amazing to have even more functionality, semi working computers, real missions and maybe AI or even real online crew mates .... would defo pay for that!! ;-)

2022-05-28 16:59:15.685333,didfem,Disappointing,"I was thrilled at first until I found two major flaws:
1. After having opened this app. many times, I noticed that only three ISS locations are displayed. One is over northern Italy, another one is over western Cuba and the last one is somewhere in a tropical region because a gigantic tropical storm is displayed, but was unable to identify the only two visible islands. If I let it run, the ISS location remains unchanged, although it rotates on its own axis. After 30 minutes to one hour, still the same position, and I believe the ISS flies around the Earth in 90 minutes...!
2. When I was in the observation dome and I removed my VR goggles to check the map, it happened a few times that when I came back and put my goggles on again, I found myself OUTSIDE of the vessel. The first time, I was somehow scared because I was drifting away. (I know, I just had to remove the goggles and quit the app., but we have to take these games seriously, don't we?) Anyhow, I found that I could get back closer to the ISS with the ""thrusters"" on the Rift S manipulators, but it became scarier: I could see the ""framework"" and the inside of the station with its bulkheads, wiring and ducts, but without its skin. The problem was that I could not get in through the open space between the frame components. I was caught between a dark space surrounding the ISS and its missing shell, and unable to get inside. I tell you, it was just like in a nightmare. (Yeah, I know, remove your goggles, dummy!) Anyhow, I fiddled with the manipulators and was able to get back inside by using the ""Reset Position"" feature. Still, I don't understand how come the software doesn't ""lock me"" inside the vessel when I am not in ""Space Walk"" mode.","Apr 28, 2020 at 11:24 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 16:59:18.793021,Billorean,It's free...,"Big fan of space, love the ISS, was looking forward to this. It starts with a nice rendering of the ISS and I was thinking okay this could be cool. I skipped trying the tutorial and went straight for the spacewalk mission, I couldn't seem to find what it was asking me to do to the spacesuit so I moved around the station which was nice. I got to the observation porthole and viewed Earth, motionless, no sense of the ISS moving or the Earth rotating. 
It would be quite a big ask to have the entire Earth reasonably accurately looming ever-present in the background, but as it was stuck at a fixed point I lost all immersion and quit. 
Pity.","Feb 10, 2020 at 6:04 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 16:59:18.807980,Satconcook,,"This is a great learning experience for the International Space Station. There are several videos, photos and a couple things to interact with. All while moving around in zero gravity. However, you really need a good VR stomach to handle the movement in this experience. Some of the scale feels a little off, but it is a decent representation from the videos they show. It has achievements and the most difficult is to get 5 resupply modules docked without an accident. I didn’t see a way to just do the mission without having to go through the tutorial each time though. The “Look ma, two hands” achievement wouldn’t register till I changed the two hand control on and off. If you have any interest in modern astronauts, this is a must try experience.","Feb 7, 2020 at 12:59 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 16:59:25.071229,Feintgames,Amazing experience,"I'm a big fan of the ISS and have been listening to Scott Kelly's book for the second time.  I gave this game a try and honestly it exceeded my expectations in every way.  The US/Euro segment is able to be navigated, but the Russian segment is closed.  You can do spacewalks and you can use the Canadarm to dock a supply capsule which is just an incredible experience. The only criticisms are the ""radio"" transmissions from Huston which are kind of silly and break immersion a little.  Also, your body is a bit mass-less, which makes moving around easier, but when rotating with both hands can cause some discomfort.  Overall, it's totally cool.  Very highly recommended.  Played on Valve Index with Revive with no problems.  BTW, the earth is moving in the background.  Some people said it wasn't but it is.  There's no day/night cycle, but hopefully that will be added in the future for a truly terrifying experience.  Then they will need to add headlamps to the spacesuits.  I can't believe this is free.  I'd pay money for this.","Nov 8, 2019 at 8:09 AM",5, 3,

I've used this in a public installation and it was the most popular VR app in our catalogue, until we changed from using Rift to Oculus Go, which doesn't work nearly as well.

You can see all the things with descriptions made by real astronauts - and the BEST part: you can TRY a lot of stuff yourself. I have learned a lot.

Yes, mechanics of this game are challenging, but it actually adds to feeling like you are in ISS. I lost track of floor direction almost immediately :-D

I have to admint - as I stood in tank top and sweat pants and operated Canadarm - I totally felt like Ripley. Which brings me to interresting idea. Can you imagine upgrade to this game, where you actually are fighting something? Like alien, but with current tech? On ISS?

Anyway this is absolutely best space simulator I have ever seen.","Apr 16, 2019 at 12:35 AM",5, 5,

It provides a full and detailed recreation of the ISS' interior, and the views of space and earth through exterior facing windows are truly breathtaking.

Add to that the ability to control the Canadarm to help a supply capsule dock, and a spacewalk, and by the end of this, you'll feel you've been there, and done it.

The only criticism, the experience is all to brief - as is too often the case with VR exclusive titles.  Still, this is a must-have for anyone and everyone, particularly if you're a stargazer.

An incredible game could be made out of this layout.  Life on the ISS.  A few weeks of missions, experiments, Canadarm tasks, spacewalks and repairs ... it's screaming for an update.  Ah well, it costs nothing to dream. :)

2022-05-28 16:59:40.964719,metafish69,Incredible experience! Movement lacks.,"What an experience! Absolutely captivating as an immersive space demo. Educational, interactive, gorgeous.

The biggest set-back of this one here is the clunky turning. It fades out and in quickly rather than being smooth movement which ruins the immersion and the only other option is to turn yourself by grabbing objects with both hands. This is a setting you have to turn on. Unfortunately, it is so terrible in execution that it makes it a pain in the neck to turn and really hampers the entire immersion :( 

The forward and backward movement is very well executed and fluid and to have messed up the turning this bad is a shame.

Lots of material and videos around to look at; I did play the intro part and got sucked in for a long time. Floating takes a bit to get used to; but once you do, you will be grabbing and floating like a pro.
As simulation is probably the best ever made for VR; it is realistic and as such, you can buy that this is how it feels to be in space. 
The negative is the space walks; graphics outside are not that great; and you are fundamentally spiderman, since you can just grab anything and move around, instead of being scared for having to use only the rails.

-: Joystick on Touch controller to control angle of view should be avoided as it changes angle abruptly.
-: Definitively dizziness inducing mostly at unexpected times – some people could likely experience motion sickness.

The movement is very natural and very fun (I recommend turning on 2-handed navigation from the menu, it's not the default setting so you have to proactively turn it on).  I am prone to occasional motion sickness in VR but it's not a problem for me on this one; I believe because my brain is simply becoming more accustomed to VR in general. So my guess is, if you're still new to VR then perhaps you'll experience some motion sickness, but over time that will dissipate.  And heck, it's not like astronauts never get motion sickness in real life while in zero gravity so just chalk it up to realism if it happens, lol. My only regret is there isn't more to see and do.  The Russian part of the ISS is inaccessible, I don't know how realistic that is. If it's used for storage in RL then I can see why they wouldn't bother to model it in the game, but an explanation for why you can't visit a third of the station would be nice. My other gripe is there are only two missions.  One is capturing a supply capsule and connecting it to the ISS using the Canada Arm, the other is exiting the airlock in a spacesuit for a quick EVA. Both are great fun, and I would like more.  Using the Canada Arm is especially rewarding because of the Touch controllers: you grab the translational joysticks just as you would in RL, so you're moving your hands in precisely the same motions that an astronaut would have to in order to capture a supply capsule and dock it to the station(!) The missions wouldn't have to be completely different than the existing two, just more variations of those same two.  But if my only gripe is that there isn't more of this game, and the game is only $11 and change, then it's a pretty solid purchase.","Mar 29, 2017 at 8:19 AM",4, 4,

And you have to use it because even though you can look in any direction you can NOT use both touch controllers at the same time to rotate... while you can grab things and pull/push your way around the statition you cannot rotate your body except for 90 degree turns! This is a very big negative and takes alot away from an otherwise nice app. I would give 4-5 stars if this issue alone was fixed.

2022-05-28 17:00:18.875322,bendean2122,A Must Try with Huge Potential,"First of all let me just say that this is an amazing experiance in the Rift, Considering it is free its absolutly incredible! I had a lot of fun floating around inside, docking ships from the cupola and doing EVAs. I do however have a few improvements.

1: Proper 3D earth. One of my biggest gripes with this is that is does not show the ISS zooming around the planet at 17200 mph but instead shows it in a geostationary orbit above some place. The earth out the window is nothing more than a stationary image. :( this is a shame as I was looking forward to watching the world go by below me but its far too static I'm afraid. This is expecially important if this wants to be used in an education situation where youre trying to teach kids about the ISS and how it orbits the earth. It would not be difficult to make a 3D earth and have it rotating below the ISS in a realistic manner... From that altitude it doesn't need to be more than a sphere with some satalite photos on it and a spec/gloss map for water.

2:Proper Day/Night cycle. This fits in with the previous point... once you give it an earth to orbit around you then need to think about a proper day/night cycle. The ISS orbits the earth in about 90 mins so it experiances day/sunset/night/sunrise in that time... thats 16 times a day! It would be awesome for it to have a realistic day/night cycle. Surely one of the greatest things you get to see as an astronaut is a sunrise or sunset during an EVA and all of the city night lights scudding by below you. I understand there may some technical limitations to this with shadows/etc but ADRIFT managed to do it fairly well.

I'd happily pay £10-15 for a version of this with those two above features added. I think it would add much more to the experiance, and also make it more realistic for education etc.

3: Is more things to do, ship repairs, taking photos from the cupola of specific cities on the awesome 3D earth etc ;)

2022-05-28 17:00:22.031880,westingtyler,immersion & existence - perfect for VR,"I was planning to make this myself, just so it existed. Now I don't have to! I hope someday they add more detail, like the Russian section of the station, which is sadly missing, the ability to open the food crates, watch some water balls in space, and open the bed areas to look and get inside. And people. It would be great to meet people going about their days, doing experiments. I'd gladly pay $60 for this if they added 10 more missions like the three here. Add the ability to experience the whole deal like crew switch-out; you fly up, you dock, you live, you experiment, you switch out and go home and experience re-entry. It'd be great.
-
For totally political reasons, add a section that explains the huge benefits of the space program up to now and into the future, and compare that to how small the actual budget is.
-
Con: re-orienting yourself once you've turned vertically is tricky since vertical rotation messes with the angle increments, so you get into weird diagonal angles you can't easily get out of. You have to rotate down, tilt your head sideways, then rotate back up. Not bad, but it would be great to have an option to re-align yourself to an arbitary wall direction.
-
It's free, and I enjoyed it more than many paid experiences because of the sense of immersion it gives, ESPECIALLY the sound design, with all the white noise of varying pitches, and the whirring around your head when you get close to some machinery and windows. Excellent job on that.

As a taste of moving around an orbiting space station in microgravity using your Touch hands, this gets me excited for Lone Echo.  
-
We need more VR experiences that focus on existence, on ""day in the life"" stuff. Realize that the mundane aspects of another person's life, can feel extraordinary and enriching to experience. We don't NEED an amazing twisting, thrilling plot as much as we need EXISTENCE, PROGRESSION, and FREEDOM to exist and explore and live as another lives. This gives a taste of that.","Mar 11, 2017 at 8:20 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:00:22.047836,TiFinVR,VR Revolution-Movement based on grabbing,"Grabbing walls and other fixed stuff to move around is the best way to move in VR that I have encountered until now. Although it may seem only applicable to zero-gravity environments, this way to move in the VR environment by grabbing things to advance in a certain direction could be applied to any env - where the user may be allowed to grab anytime anywhere (""grab air"") with the left hand. It is the most realistic and engaging experience of movement in VR, better than teleporting from fixed point-to fixed point and much better than moving around using the joysticks. Also this is much less nauseating. As an example for future developments, in a shooter people could use their left hand to grab (air) and push themselves in a certain direction based on the direction of the hand movement. Non-zero-gravity environments would allow only movement on a plane, not in 3-dimensions like in this astronaut simulator.","Mar 19, 2017 at 7:46 PM",5, 2,

Cons:
Should remove the ""jets"" and stick with the awesome push/grab system.  It's a freebie and it shows in various small ways.  Like the jet section, very limited ""missions"", mission audio playing over the in app videos, limited quality beyond the ISS itself, etc.","Mar 19, 2017 at 3:49 PM",4, 0,

Mission: ISS has good (I won't say high or triple A standards) presentation and quality and has educational value (even though they could have given it more of an educational focus than they did). This is, in my opinion, exactly what VR needs more of. My nephew had to watch some videos on the ISS for his 7th grade class... how much cooler would it have been for him to play this? PS. A lot of people are complaining about motion sickneess. I was expecting this to get me really sick, since I tend to be very susceptible to flight/float kinds of VR motion sickness. I can't really play Ultrawings or Detached for more than five minutes without getting sick.

Motion sickness can be an issue, but as there is no hurry, you get a chance to get used to the movement. First I had problems but the next day I could explore for an hour or so without problems. 

I really got an impression of the ISS and learned a lot. But then there are some things missing and I hope the developers are not finished with this little gem. There is no access to the russian modules. There should be more interaction or at least more explaining movies. Those that are in there are good, though. 
I also liked exploring the ISS in EVA. But especially outside there are so many interesting things to see because of the great detail level and I asked myself ""What is this? What is that for?..."" And it would be great if you could just point to it and get an explaination.
I also spotted the AMS-experiment. I know that this is an antimatter detector for dark matter research, but got no word about it from the program.

Going outside was surreal.  Using the Canadarm was surreal.  Becoming familiar with this place I'll never visit is surreal.  This experience makes me very proud of what we as a species are accomplishing, and hope we continue down that path.   FEEDBACK:  The videos and info panels that can be triggered throughout are very informational and entertaining.  They honestly left me wanting more of them, so I'm hoping there will be future updates to that effect.   The only gripe I have is that voiceovers in the tutorial and missions modes interrupt any info panel video I have running, and it's not obvious how to dismiss an info panel except just flying away from it.

2022-05-28 17:00:56.823824,Enda,Brilliant,"Thank you Oculus and devs, fantastic job.  Even if it was just floating around doing nothing it would be great, but you get to do stuff and interact.  Can't recommend it enough.","Mar 10, 2017 at 10:12 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:00:56.840778,FriendCalledFive,Really well done ISS simulation,"Very recommended for anyone into space related stuff. Only downside is it makes me a bit nauseous, but as it is a zero-g sim it is to be expected, and it isn't too bad.

Great app.","Mar 10, 2017 at 3:11 AM",5, 0,
