2022-05-28 19:42:39.541149,Satconcook,Not made for Rift,"Great concept, being able to watch videos in an arena and having options for 360 content. However, this menu option may be good for something like the Oculus Go, it is horrible for any system with a controller. Trying to navigate anything just by gazing at it, to include typing, is painstaking and very time consuming. It has a walk feature that just starts moving you in the direction you are looking till you gaze at the menu to stop it again.  Trying to navigate the menus by the gaze option and then getting put back to the start each time is even more frustrating. Much of the 360 content looks low quality and I didn’t see any 3D content. Maybe the videos that need to be paid for individually or through subscription are better?","Feb 7, 2020 at 2:31 PM",2, 1,
