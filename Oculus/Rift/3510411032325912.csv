However, the teleportation system is absolutely awful and I found it to be immersion breaking. You can only teleport to certain nodes and sometimes it takes several attempts to get it to work properly. There is also no narrator, but you can read some rather dull brief texts concerning each location. Overall, I didn't really learn much about ancient Rome but I did find it to be a relaxing experience. I learned alot more in some VR apps from Steam made by Flyover Zone.","Apr 30, 2021 at 1:13 PM",3, 4,
