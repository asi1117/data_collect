You are presented with a menu, and you select ""Start Game"" on the left by shooting it. Then you see a high score list with three names, the second of which is spelled wrong (""alein""). The whole game lasts maybe a couple minutes and consists of shooting presents into chimneys and destroying radioactive snowmen. I was able to get 24/24 chimneys and was presented with a bonus round - shooting balloons. I practiced for a while and was able to get an amazing score (>50,000) to beat even Santa. However, my name did not get recognized and the high score list did not change. Alas, it was all for naught. There are even 16 broken achievements included in this game which reveal plans to add more levels. Currently there is only one.","Feb 5, 2018 at 12:41 PM",1, 3,"It shows you the high score for the next level not the last level. There are 4 levels that are randomly generated. Each Level is harder than the last. You thought it was the same level, but it wasn't. The Achievements are in the works.  I'm still learning how to set them up. The code for the achievements dwarfs the rest of the entire game."

2022-05-28 19:53:08.398434,AirwolfPL,Santa simulator,This is typical 3D freeware game but in VR. You are a Santa. You are shooting presents. With present cannons. It's fun. For the whole first playthrough. Then  it's boring.,"Dec 29, 2017 at 11:43 PM",3, 1,I could of designed the level randomness a little bit better. I'm glad you enjoyed it the first play at least. I have time to improve it more before next Christmas
