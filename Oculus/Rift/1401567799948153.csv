You are too low to the ground, you need to move your arms back and forth which sometimes gets tiring,  you constantly need to keep the thumbstick up to stand, and the amount of swinging you need to do just to move some feet is so stupid. WAY too much money for this garbage.","May 16, 2021 at 11:48 AM",1, 5,"Sorry to hear you had a bad experience!

The ability to explore, play and find little amusing Easter eggs means this is a hit. Highly recommended for the kids (and parents)","Nov 8, 2019 at 4:46 AM",5, 44,Thanks for the great review!

2022-05-28 15:22:13.145464,SilverwolfMD,Amusing experience but major bugs,"I'd like to say that this game is great to mess around with.  Doesn't need much of a story, it's just something to play with.

However, there are a couple of major bugs that I think must be addressed...the stand-up/climb system doesn't seem to work too well with Oculus Touch.  The control scheme for that is kind of awkward.  When I try to climb onto the bed, nothing happens.

The most major bug occurs with the controls themselves.  For some reason, while using the crawl mechanic, if I have to adjust my position in the real world, the vertical position in the game seems to be stuck.  If I stand up to adjust something (say, move my headset cable), when I sit down again, my view shows that I'm UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR.  Ten minutes into the game and I'm reaching up to the ceiling just to see what's at ground level.

I hope they address this problem, I don't like to see programming errors get in the way of a good game (I should know, I've made a few myself, and they frustrate me to no end in testing).","May 19, 2019 at 1:53 AM",3, 18,
