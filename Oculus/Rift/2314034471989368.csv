2022-05-28 16:53:32.236934,Polymorph42,The new DLC is great!,"I don't normally write reviews, but considering this game really isn't my taste in music but I still enjoyed it. What really gets me playing this game is the new smoke and thunder dlc. A nice change of style and much more my taste. Basically just playing this on repeat over all the other levels. I really hope they release more rock styles or some different genres like funk ect as it's the only reason I bought the game. 
Even with the limited songs I personally enjoy it's a fantastic game and worth a buy!",Feb 6 at 8:43 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:53:35.362574,alldabois1,SUPER fun! better than Beat Saber!,"man, have I had my fair share of rhythm games, friday night funkin', guitar hero, RB4, beat saber, the list goes on and on, but none have surprised me (in terms of overall quality) as much as pistol whip does! For starters, you don't have to buy any songs, so you have the entire game when you buy it, crossbuy, so I can play it on my pc too! Graphics are HIGH for a quest 2 standard, and I never see lag. Campaign is really fun and cool (both 2089 and smoke & thunder). And the modifier combos are endless, with many cool guns, replayability is higher than any game I ever played, that says something because most rhythm games have none of this stuff! So, what does PW have to offer? FAST paced gameplay? hard-to-beat opponents? so many notes you are going to break your arms?? Nope, it offers fun gameplay, levels that are SPECIFICALLY tailored to the song theme, progressive difficulty, and an overall good time. So, should you buy pistol whip?
Yup, it is a relief over all other rhythm games that try to kill you after breaking your arms, not letting you enjoy the music, going at breakneck speeds, so, purchase this game, and have fun bopping fully armored men with guns, and enjoy pistol whip!",Apr 9 at 2:02 AM,5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:53:35.391497,cj.foreldo.1,Mind-blowingly-good,"VR is awesome. 
You know what's better than that? A good game in VR; the sort of thing that makes you grit your teeth, sway all over the place and scream with frustrated delight. Pistol Whip is an experience; a wonderful, beautiful journey into the baser instincts of man and our relentless desire to pull the trigger on anything that moves....

I'm an older gamer, Pong, Manic miner and all that, so it's an absolute joy to have this immersive rollercoaster. It reminds me of the old arcade machine ""Operation Wolf"" except ""Pistol Whip"" lets you get into the console...

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys trigger action. There's a great choice of pace and difficulty each with their own sense of reward. 

 Pistol Whip is a refined vision, best served with auto-aim off. 

Wonderful. Thank you for the endless grins.",Sep 10 at 7:06 PM,5, 37,
2022-05-28 16:53:35.407455,tadduda,Campaign is Phenomenal,"This was an excellent game when it was just a couple of tracks that the devs made levels around. Now, we have a campaign (2089) comprised of five levels where the marriage of music to gameplay is so sublimely cinematic and heart-pounding, it's unironically my favorite VR experience since Half-Life: Alyx. There is character progression, gamplay diversity, great setpieces and a fantastic boss in this one little package. Go play it.

Update: Blood and Thunder is even better. This is a quality video game.",Aug 16 at 7:34 AM,5, 15,

2022-05-28 16:53:38.578972,Rikiya808,only 1 star so the devs so the review,please add bhaptic feedback for the tactosy hands. any vibration feedback support for bhaptic the tactosy hands would be amazing! doesn't need to be pinpoint accurate feedback or feedback for every action just any feedback while doing some actions would be so much more immersive and hopefully not too much work(I only use the bhaptic hands and would love any vibration feedback added/supported) Once this review gets a reply and hopefully updated I will update the review to 5/5 star which is what I believe the game deserves just missing hand bhaptic and overall bhaptic support.

2022-05-28 16:53:41.756473,pakidara2000,Unexpected rhythm-shooter,"I went into the game expecting a rail shooter. Instead, I got a rail shooter that gives you some extra points for playing a rhythm game. You won't lose from playing off rhythm; you only miss out on points from that. You only fully lose when you fail to dodge bullets or walls by tilting your head or failing to duck.

The built in mods help with replayability. Took me a while to find them by looking to my left on the main menu. I suggest playing with the ""deadeye"" and ""akimbo"" mods if the game feels too easy. It disables auto aim and puts a gun in each hand.

I won't give 5-star because the game doesn't have many songs. The campaign plays like an extended tutorial and the actual tutorial is basic. There are 3 ""sets"" of songs and the list totals out at 15 tracks.","Mar 24, 2021 at 1:51 PM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 16:53:41.787390,REIZOD,Amazing game worth the price!,"This game makes you feel like the star of a John Wick movie.  The soundtrack/scenes are on point, and the gunplay feels tight.  The graphics are fun and crisp.  If they keep adding new tracks and content even if it cost extra, it would be well worth it.  By far my favorite VR game!  

Update: Over a year(s) later and this game keeps getting better.  No real complaints so far.","Jan 5, 2021 at 4:25 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 16:53:44.872140,Sub7th,One of my favorite VR games so far,"Like Rhytm games = Check
Like Shooting Games = Check
Like punching games = Check
Like moving around, getting your blood pumping and feeling like a BA = Check|

Since I got this game I haven't touched Beat Saber. The music fits perfectly, the movement (especially with guns akimbo/dual weild) is fun and challenging.
Built in modifiers, customizations and settings to change up the game, enough levels to keep replay high.
The new campaign is just top teir and amazingly fun. Just enough story to keep you interested without being boring and some surprizes to gameplay that make you rethink your typical strategy.
It's got that old school ""Lawnmower Man"" VR look but it fits perfectly here.

This one is 100% a must have in your VR library.

Couple of tips:
Accuracy scores on a sliding scale. 0-100 on how close you were to actually hitting the target. (Using the dead eye modifier is a good way to practice)
Turn up the metronome in ""Haptics"" to help you stay on beat.
Punch/swing harder/faster when you pistol whip to get a higher score.","Jan 3, 2021 at 2:32 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:53:44.888097,f0nzane,Very solid experience.,"This is the best VR-Game I've played and one can seriously say that the team behind it did not only commit to making profit but to provide good experience to the user.
The only problem I have with the game is the score-system. For example it doesn't reward you for a good no-ammo performace (which I often prefer to absolve levels with instead of shooting). Also the accentuation on rhythm regarding the score is something I do not like. The score-system which to play the game a specific way and which is not how I like to play the game (for example I like to play no-ammo mode until I get hit once and then start to shoot)... This is my only concern.
Other than that, the game is excellent in my opinion (especially after the last update, providing a really good campaign and some melodic songs/levels instead of just full ham).","Dec 20, 2020 at 7:08 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 16:53:44.903057,ruscosmin,The new campaign is brilliant!!!,"Finally, a game for my soul. That king of game you want to never end!!! Cyberpunk 2O77 is like a beatch comparing to this one: shiny and full of crabs :))) I don't like to trash people but I also like to tell the truth :P
I'm not sure if I'm a genius or something but plaing this game on HARD it's too easy for me :P It's very easy to dodge bullets. I just move constantly my head arround and I'm always safe. Maybe if target the full body or set some special robots which are crazy and will shut randome so I can be aware and doge the bullets more  carefull ;)","Dec 26, 2020 at 6:30 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:53:44.918017,GMgregster94,Great game(and workout game),"I was a bit hesitant when I heard about this game coming out, it seemed a little iffy to me when seeing the trailer for the game, but it honestly is worth it if you have a big VR playspace. 
Basically imagine John Wick, but with EDM-ish(?) music playing. 
If you're a beginner to VR, I wouldn't play this just yet, but when you get more comfortable playing games that involve moving left to right, up and down, along with dodging bullets, you'll like this game. 
It's basically Beatsabre, but with guns, or SUPERHOT if the slow-mo only slightly worked on bullets, with music in the background. 
I do think there needs to be more music to select from, even though the ones it comes with, along with the added Campaign/extra songs did just come out, there could be more.
Hopefully they'll allow mod support as well, maybe something like a track editor(maybe something better than Beatsabre's track editor too).

Overall, this game is really great, it gets your blood pumping, and keeps you moving.","Dec 20, 2020 at 6:58 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:53:44.931979,ben827,new update = awesome!,"wow, i loved playing this game, the music fits so well with the gameplay, and so many modifications can be made in-game, but the campaign update settles the deal, just SO MUCH fun to play, and that music...

Gets you moving around, pulling off stylish moves, you feel like you've had a workout when you finally remove your headset and see how much time has flown by in-game.

2022-05-28 16:53:51.191238,RuneSR2,Fov bug FINALLY fixed!!!,"Been using this game for months, due to being a low-poly non-textured Quest port, this game has extremely low hardware requirements - well, Quest does have the same gpu as the old Samsung S8 phone. 
However, this means that you can activate extremely high levels of super sampling (ss) to get the most amazing image quality. I can use ss 2.5 with my CV1 and still get solid 90 fps - just using a GTX 1080. 
Sound is awesome using CV1, even much better than the Index. The gameplay is very repetitive - you constanly shoot same kinds of men, never any big monsters (or boss fights) - but still great fun.","Sep 6, 2020 at 7:31 AM",5, 20,

Like in no time you can just play a quick round - no long loading or very long levels, just get in, select a weapon, modificants and difficult level you desire & start.

It's immensely fun and simplee but also very challenging. Beat Saber might be more popular but I prefer PistolWhip simply because it really forces you to move (especially with the Vengeance modifier) and you can really work up a real sweat. 

Oh it's Crossbuy so for those with the Quest you get the best of both worlds. The desktop version is just a little more detailed and the image is a little clearer. But the quest is still not bad - especially when you're concentrating on shooting and dodging the extra eye candy isn't that noticeable but being UNTETHERED is DEFINITELY noticeable!

For a rhythm game, this game is far more unique than others like Beat Saber. Replaying the songs and campaign becomes addicting and it makes me put my headset back on anytime I get the chance just to get that rush you will always get when playing it.

Too bad my quest controllers desync sometimes randomly still. I have a couple of the top scores under flamingsnowman. 

It regularly gets me into a sweat and I use arm weights for faster workouts, 15-20 minutes in and I'm covered in sweat, especially religion.

Whereas in Beat Saber you are apparently stationary while objcts are flying toward you, and it doesn't give me any discomfort. Comfort level for this game should be at least moderate.

The music is EDM cool in a hyper surreal Euro way, not cheesy Vegas. My only gripe is not being able to control speed of rail. Brilliant how they took very basic Superhot graphics and made them so immersive.  Bad how they couldn't let you slow down a bit on your terms to feel like you had a legit stake.

imo deadeye should be the default, with a 'relax' mode like osu where the current default is for just no effort john wicking instead of doing squats and lunges for 4 minutes john wicking 

overall fantastic game and i like the songs. if modding support was possible this would be huge, i have whole playlists from my friends that are exactly this genre and would fit great but copyright issues i understand :(

edit: i haven't experienced the fov problem myself and I have played quest + vd +  on link, is it a rift issue exclusively?

also i wouldnt compare it to superhot except for the visuals being stylistic in a similar manner, but a lot of games did that style for budgeting. this is a purely memorization game, since spawns are fixed per difficulty, and not a solve puzzle via violence game where you can take your time","May 4, 2020 at 9:44 PM",5, 4,

I was able to get it working by opening another program and tabbing between them and/or running this in a window, but of course the bug should have been addressed by now (check the 1 star reviews for all the others still having this issue).

Unrelated to the FOV bug, since I was able to play using the work-around, my updated review is: Not a very good rhythm game.  It is a decentish shooter if you ignore the supposed rhythm aspect, and if you want to combine shooting + workout it might be of interest, but there are so many far better shooters available (minus the workout), and better rhythm games available (including the workout) that I just don't know who I'd recommend this to.

It makes you feel like a real bad*ss. I decided to try to turn this into more of a fitness game while finding ways to get cardio in during the lockdown, and I figured out I could get my heart rate up super high by playing this with a weight vest on (64 lbs) while not noticing nearly as much struggling when hitting similar levels on a trackmill or bike. It was more effective than my usual pace on my rowing machine while feeling just as sustainable over periods of a half-hour plus.

Pros
-Cool Graphics
-Cool soundtrack
-Addictively fun
-Lots of different levels
-Fun to play with a group of friends to see who gets high score

Sidenote - I did have one minor issue with the latest AMD drivers and RX5700xt, but its not really PistolWhips fault. You could only see graphics out of one side of the headset (left). Updating to the newest optional AMD driver solves the issue and game is very stable otherwise.

Wishlist for developer:
1. More tracks, right now I think it is resonable. And most important, I think they have got a good style. Fallen Angel, Asgard Tales or Poet of the Fall... I was thinking about a track with some Max Payne feeling. 
2. Maybe adding some boost to make time goes bullet-time. This could be handy in Hard mode for those moments where many enemies.
3. Increase variety of enemies, and a ""boss fight"". It could be wonderful to have a bigger challenge in each stage, for example: towards the end you can see an enemy on a transport like a helicopter or motorbikes, something out of the ordinary enemies could help a bit. Something just a bit settle, no need to go too crazy.","Feb 11, 2020 at 1:11 PM",5, 8,

Dodging the walls felt very ""gamey"", if you step to the side it yells at you to return to the center so you have to lean, but then your actual body just goes right through the obstacle. It never really felt good

Bullets from enemies felt very disconnected from their location, and some would blend right in with the background.

The shooting is weird since it doesn't really emphise aim, you can most just aim at someone and it will correct towards them. The problem is that it is inconsistent, I had multiple times where I would miss a few inches to the left, on an enemy I thought I killed (since I'm trained to think when I shoot towards them they are going to die), then I would shoot again and miss a few inches to the right and by then I'm dead from some bullet, while I busy wrestling with the controls.

Finally the game could do a better job at not making the enemy spawns seem so sudden, it was difficult to anticipate when/where enemies would show up and there wasn't any visual cue until they are already there.

It just mostly seems unfinished, I can see where if it were polished it could be fun, but currently it isn't.","Nov 8, 2019 at 3:18 AM",2, 132,"Hi ExceedSC. Thanks for the feedback. You'll see many updates/improvements monthly :) You might want to try adjusting the game settings (to your left) to better accommodate both your playspace and play style. We would recommend adjusting your ""Playspace"" within ""Player Settings"" to set up a custom volume for center warning triggers. Aim-Assist measures your distance to target and scores you based on how close you were to that target. For pro-marksmen we recommend selecting ""Modifiers"" and activating ""Deadeye"" to remove aim-assist. Enemy spawns occur with a special VFX moment as they materialize into their location (once you recognize the visual cue its easy to pick out the spawn moment). Thanks for playing!"

2022-05-28 16:54:32.430937,Blastacular,Okay Arcadey Game,"Visually it looks really cool and the music is great. I had a good time playing so far. However I had a couple issues right off the bat that almost made me return in it.

1. The game defaults to single hand, starting you with only one gun. I thought my controller was dead because of this. If you want to dual wield you can but you have to go to the ""modifiers"" and turn it on. When you do this you get punished by -25% of your score. I feel this should be opposite. You should start off dual wielding because it feels more natural in VR. Then switch the modifier to single gun with +25%. It would solve any confusion plus feel more like a positive skill switching to a harder difficulty with one hand behind your back. 

2. The trailers made it look like the gun shots always hit on a beat of the music. I thought it may have had some programming like Electronauts, where no matter what you hit you always hit on a beat and feel like part of the music. Instead I feel like I'm floating and shooting with music on in the background. 

Those are really the only issues/expectations I had. The game while kinda fun just fell a bit short... Nothing that can't be tightened up and patched in an update.","Nov 8, 2019 at 3:48 AM",3, 38,

- Fun and intuitive gameplay

- Provides exercise when you really go for it on the harder difficulties

- Clean and colourful cyperpunk aesthetic

- Good selection of gameplay modifiers that affect score
- Some good sound and visual customisation for weapons

2022-05-28 16:54:41.892630,apoisonedgift,Way more fun than it has any right to be,"I was pretty excited for Pistol Whip, though as with any VR game you never know until you try it. But I've put a heap of time into it now (having finished all the songs on Easy and Normal, starting hard now) and I am absolutely loving it. I can see this becoming a staple game that I play over and over just like  Beat Saber, and I think that as long as they add content over time it will have the same sort of staying power.

A lot of really smart decisions were made when making PW. Not only does the fact that its on rails help tremendously with focus and managing any issues with locomotion-based VR sickness, you only have to aim roughly at the enemies. This means you can focus on having fun and planning your next shot rather than having to line up careful headshots. As you get into a groove, you will naturally get more accurate, and then you get more points for better shots. If you get shot, you only have to avoid being shot again (or hitting a wall) for a short period to get back to full health, ensuring that its fun and challenging, without ever feeling impossible.

Honestly, I cannot recommend this game enough. I really hope they add a heap more content as time goes on, but even as it is, for the asking price, this is a no brainer and one of the best VR experiences I've had to date.","Nov 9, 2019 at 8:05 PM",5, 9,

I found that the view blows out when the secondary screen (laptop/monitor) fullscreen's itself to begin playing.  If you ALT+ENTER that screen and simply take it out of Forced full screen it corrects the view in the headset.  This is 100% repeateable in my instance.  ALT+ENter.. Full screen on laptop/Monitor = Blown out/Zoomed view in VR..  Minimize or exit out of max full screen on laptop/monitor = Fixed view in VR..
With that done this game is very cool and very enjoyable.  I would give it a solid 4-5 stars and will do so once this issue is corrected.

As has been mentioned a bunch of times.  This game's POV is completely broken.  Ultra zoomed in.  The smallest head movement translates into giant swings on the menus and in game which make it nauseating and completley unplayable.  Your hands and guns, due to the zoom, are actually 3 ft BEHIND you.  At 6ft tall if I completely extend my arms I and look down I can barely see the tip of the gun.

Have been playing rhythm games for years (DDR, amplitude, guitar hero, rock band, soundboxing, beat saber, rez, boxVR, and audica) and really enjoy the genre in VR. I know several people have called this a John wick simulator and it really does feel like that to me. Playing on Normal/Hard I was dodging and ducking around in my play space and worked up quite a sweat in my 30 minutes of play time. 

I am a huge fan of leaderboards so learning the scoring system (shooting enemies in time with the music awards more points) means I have lots to improve on as I continue to play. Can’t wait to see more content! For the current asking price, the variety of songs is a little low and it really feels like an early access title. Even the version number is below a 1.0 release indicating the studio has additional development and tweaking ahead (which is encouraging!)

If you want a game that has guns with realistic accuracy then go somewhere else. If you are tired of standing on a platform and cutting up blocks, but still want that electro soundtrack and a constant influx of targets to hit, then this is the game for you.

Yes, your aim doesn't have to be great. But that's not the point. This is a John Woo action movie. Where the hero has unlimited bullets and nearly limitless stamina. Enemies pop up, you shoot them. More Enemies pop up, you shoot them too. Out of bullets? Melee time.

This game is just plain fun and is the VR equivalent of a sidescrolling shooter. There are no save points, just get better or memorize the patterns. Like any other rhythm inspired game.

It doesn't get a perfect score because this game should be Dual Wield by default. And the option shouldn't be buried in the Modification menu.

Another complaint is dodging walls is frustratingly difficult. I feel like it's buggy and that my timing on the dodges is perfect, but about 80% of the time I hit one anyway. This is a really common complaint with the game and the devs should rework the collision or spacing of those walls.

It takes a while to get the hang of it and I found it easier to shoot on beat if a enabled the metronome in the game settings.  With that enabled your controller pulses to the beat.  I'm starting to get some top 10 scores on the leaderboard and some S rank scores.  And to make things better it supports cross buy with the Quest.

2022-05-28 16:55:04.053358,Mayonnaiseman,Ignore the other reviews. BUY IT.,"This review is going to counter the top rated 2 star review.
Okay Listen,
For the people complaining about the game being too hard because enemies spawn already opening fire at you - if you remember correctly, old arcade games were virtually un-beatable, and un saveable. You either were good enough to beat them and get your name on the scoreboard, or you lose your money and go home.  This game feels like this (on hard mode) but they have an easy mode, and a no fail option.

-There is an option to turn off the setting where it tells you to go to the center of the area.

Seriously though,
If you are a fan of Electronic/Dubstep/bass music - John Wick / The Matrix / - Beat Saber and Super Hot, it's like all of those elements had a baby and this is the outcome. It's insanely fun. I played the game for 2 hrs straight, and I can't wait until more content/maps/songs are released.  I enjoyed every second.

You dip/duck under bullets and walls so frequently, i never even realized I was doing an intense squat themed leg workout until i realized i couldn't walk up the stairs when I was done.  I'm not kidding, I'm still sore.

The game is well worth the money just to be able to show it as a first-time VR shooter. You can easily throw it on easy mode or no fail and anybody would have a blast just being in the environment and ducking under bullets.  

You do, however, have to change the ""dual wield"" function in the options, it's not default, so I have actually been playing like that for a lower score just because it's way more fun to do.  If I ever try to top the scoreboards, I'll go the single style.

If the devs end up reading this, the only thing I would like to see in the future is maybe a few maps that incorporate turns around corners, or possibly heigh/speed changes (ie, elevators, flights of stairs, Jumping off of a roof, etc)
other than that, I love it with all of my heart. Jumping into medium/hard really does make you feel like John Wick.","Nov 21, 2019 at 7:49 AM",5, 0,

Yes, I loved Lone Echo but truly, there is no other game like Beat Saber, a game that keep you going and going no matter what.  I was able to master it to Expert+ level and even getting an ""S""  on most tracks.  My arms feel so much stronger after months of practice....  that is until Pistol Whip.

This game will do to your legs what beat saber does to your arms, it's almost the perfect complement !

No other game makes you excercise and have so much fun like this one.

This game is now second on my TOP list for MUST HAVE VR games after Beat Saber.

You CANNOT skip this one.   Also,  plays exactly the same on the Quest so it's a must buy if you have one, the other or both.

Gameplay wise it's just perfect.  Yes, it does have aim assist but even then it's hard as hell in hard difficulty. 

This game coupled with beat saber is the perfect Gym !.","Nov 12, 2019 at 7:57 AM",5, 2,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2kvawkk9CE

My Initial Impressions:
Pistol Whip is a unique rhythm shooter that will not appeal to everyone and you'll need to be reasonably fit to get the most out of it.
Satisfaction also comes in the form of getting off those shots in time to the beat.
ALSO I think this game has not QUITE reached its potential yet!
I would like to see a Campaign mode, some more 'Dance Style' tracks and other modes like Speed Trials etc. So hopefully the devs will continue to build and make this game even better.
I do think this is a unique game and I also think it will opened up a new genre for VR.
PS. Having played both the Rift S and Quest version, I think I prefer the Quest version due to the freedom element, ie no cable and there really is no graphical hit playing on the Quest.

Look at the screenshots and tell me ""Yea, thanks Captain Obvious.""

Edit - A few comments on other reviews:

You can turn off the notification you get from stepping out of your play space if you don't like it.

Enemy bullets have multiple rings around them, move slowly, and buzz if they get near you, so you shouldn't have trouble discearning them from the background.

Aim is a big part of the score. You get more points with more accurate aiming. If you want to emphasize aim even more you can turn off autoaim.

There's an effect that appears before an enemy spawns if they spawn on-screen.","Dec 3, 2019 at 11:14 AM",5, 0,
