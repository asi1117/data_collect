Each game/Excercise can be feeled long (5 minutes) but the purpose is to stay focus on the task and get the better score you can. Will be super if developper can support Oculus Quest platform too.,"Feb 3, 2021 at 2:26 AM",4, 4,

The only issue is it requires internet connection and the servers for the game seem to be down a lot so even if your internet is fine you can't do it if the server is down al day.,"Dec 3, 2020 at 7:16 AM",3, 3,
