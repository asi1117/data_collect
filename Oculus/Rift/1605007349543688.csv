First off let me say i had a lot of fun playing this game but i beat it in about an hour.  There arn't a lot of different games to use and it was kinda easy, But does have some replay value (arcade style trying to beat your previous score.)  

For 10$ I would have given 5 stars.","Oct 1, 2017 at 9:25 AM",4, 10,
