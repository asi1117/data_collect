2022-05-28 20:30:55.538806,Zaino77,"Great game, but technical issues","I like the game, appreciate the idea and the art.
Unfortunately for some reason all animations and movement of objects are extremely low frame rate. If feels like all creatures and objects moving in the world are updated at 30hz. Tried lowering graphics settings to no avail. Oculus performance also shows no frame drops.
This issue makes me queasy when I play, and I wish it could be fixed.","May 6, 2021 at 10:06 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:30:55.555761,Moshcatzep,Fun and Beautiful Game!,"The only thing more fun than playing Paper Beast for the first time is watching family members play it for the first time. Have them click on Swirly Beats on the far left and it will drop them right in at the beginning. Try not to give anything away unless they get truly stuck, or are about to quit before the intro finishes. Don't let anyone watch who hasn't already played it. It's better without spoilers. 

Sandbox mode is also fun to mess around with. It's fun to watch the plants and animals go about their business, although I could wish for a better balance between predators and prey animals.","Dec 30, 2020 at 5:14 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:30:55.572716,Mr.Fish3474,A Fascinating Experience,"I have never played a game that is so awe inspiring and breathtaking, everything about this game is beautiful, from the graphics to the sound and even how the creatures interact. Every single creature you will encounter will have it’s own intelligence, some being seemingly sentient. Every interaction that I had with these creatures felt so organic and natural. I would highly encourage you buy this game because it is well worth the money and you will not be disappointed.","Nov 30, 2020 at 8:15 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:30:55.587675,VR_Dings,AWE,"Most trippy & artistic VR puzzle game I've ever played. Awesome moods and one of the best procedural animation for animals. Have played very long. But it was enough to see that this is MAGIC and not comparable to anything else.

2022-05-28 20:30:55.605628,krisvdvijver,Jaw dropping..,"One of the more surprising VR experiences of 2020. If you love (slower/relaxing) games with focus on exploration, emotion and a little bit of thinking, and you’re looking for something else than shooting, then you have to try this game. A beautiful and original piece of interactive art.","Dec 31, 2020 at 7:20 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:30:58.712404,pathmakerjen,Escape room physics puzzler with quirks,"Missing sound - mine went to desktop speakers instead of rift cv1 headset; used my windows default sound output device instead of rift. It was ok with desktop speakers, better than no sound.

The game is right-handed only.  Us lefties have to cope with everything feeling backwards.  Left hand teleports, right hand manipulates objects.  It's still playable, just a bit awkward.

The scenery is very dark in some places. I had trouble making out what's a cave versus a shadow.  Fortunately the game doesn't give you choices; it's a straight-line sequence, not a maze, so it doesn't take long to sort out what's next.  It gives you a companion on your journey who helps show you the path.

Because it confused me: That music beats thing it offers as a diversion at the beginning menu? That's actually the real game, not a mini-game diversion.  Just stay in it for several minutes and wait for the song to end.  If you don't get audio, this is your chance to mess with your windows output destination and restart the game and try to get it working.  That's certainly easier to check on a dance floor with bouncy music than the more subtle game sound effects that come later.

Some of the puzzles are slow to work through.  The whole game has a slower pace than you might expect.  You get more than enough time to look around and play and experiment.  That said, some of the interactions still feel awkward, like you're fighting the environment to get it to do the right thing to solve the puzzle.  It's still fun in spite of that.

If you are into surreal art experiences, this is excellent.  For a puzzler, it's a little frustrating in the wrong ways, but simplistic enough to still be playable.  I'm about an hour in right now and expect to play more later.","Jul 28, 2020 at 2:04 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 20:30:58.727364,pixonoid,Outstanding,"A mesmerizing and unforgettable experience.
Take some time to enjoy this game/experience in its full glory. Definitely one of my absolut favorites in VR already.

I won’t say anything about the game since exploration and discovery is the main element of the game. The physics are superb.","Jul 25, 2020 at 11:29 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 20:30:58.742324,WormSlayer,A Beautiful and Surreal Experience,"Another fantastical world from Éric Chahi, using the novel heightmap engine developed for his previous title; *From Dust*. By far the weirdest and most interesting thing I've played since the early days of the DK1 demo scene.","Jul 25, 2020 at 6:44 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:30:58.756287,kilo247365,Simply Sublime,"Take a mind-bending stroll in a bizarre and beautiful dreamscape, full of unusual creatures and challenging puzzles. Eric Chahi and the team at Pixel Reef have done a great job realizing a uniquely mesmerizing vision. The visuals, mechanics and sound are excellent, all combining to create a highly immersive world that’s well worth the price of admission.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.","Jul 30, 2020 at 2:24 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:30:58.772245,VinnyGunnz,,"Sound isn't working though my headset in game, but if I exit out it's working fine in vr lobby and other games.  I tried the various sound qualities, hi, medium, low.  None work.  I hate to refund.  I guess I'll wait and see if I get a response or assurance it will be patched.  I am using the Bionic Mantis Attachable headphones, which are vr headphones that plug into my headset and clip on to the headband.  

Not sure if that's the issue, but it works for every other app so far for the last 6 months.

Also...I'm not even exactly sure how to start the game.  There is something called Swirly Beats.  I click on that and there is some weird stuff on screen.  No directions or anything.  I""m not exactly sure what it is or what I'm even supposed to do.","Jul 25, 2020 at 8:44 AM",1, 6,"Hi, Thanks for spoting this issue. The Dev team is on it. We hope to fix it soon and patch it!
As SwirlyBeats is a musical app, with no audio it can be annoying ;)
It will drive you in Paper Beast world.
Thanks for you patience.

Update July 31th : Patch 1.01 is now live and should fix both issues"

PS Loaded up black screen for me. Fixed my drivers and it works perfect. I hope all of the people giving this a 1 star because they can't get it to run, checks their drivers. My old video driver was from January so this will only run on the lastest drivers. Hope this helps.","Jul 27, 2020 at 12:24 PM",5, 2,
