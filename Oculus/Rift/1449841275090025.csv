2022-05-28 19:25:56.961613,MipMipi,WOW,"This game is very simple but really fun. I was calm and just played songs in my head. Yes, there is a bug in it but it doesn't matter. I have one big problem, I'm left-handed and this game is for right-handers. If the developers will add some stuff it would be nice","Apr 1, 2020 at 12:44 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:25:56.976573,Uwer123,Probaly one of the best games,"This game kept me busy for more than a few minutes. It has great pottential. My ideas for this games future is menu, left handed mode, campaign, and a store for different or chaning color rackets.","Dec 22, 2019 at 12:22 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:26:00.157066,Rift8299292,Really good,"If the name was changed to something more serious and there was a real AI opponent this could be a one of the best VR tennis games. The physics are perfect, it's immersive, simple and has great graphics and music. And it's Free! The alternative to this is ""First Person tennis - The real tennis sim"" which costs £20 which is a ridiculous price when there is no demo. This game is a really good (probably better) alternative","Feb 14, 2019 at 6:44 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:26:00.172027,JDM_plays,This game is so funny,You could do anything in VR but I never thought you could be playing tennis with a blob and if you love tennis check this out,"Nov 16, 2018 at 7:52 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:26:03.258770,12Kulturstrand48,"No options, bad controls","If there is an option menu, please tell me. I tried pressing every button. This means you can't adjust the racket angle and balls go flying everywhere: it took me around 10 tries to hit hard enough to get the ball over the net and another 10 to get it inside the court, I failed another 10 to play back to the other blobby after its hit all while twisting my wrist a lot. I give up. This isn't fun, sadly.","Aug 9, 2018 at 5:04 AM",1, 1,"Hey, I admit the ""options"" are a little too hidden:
The music can be paused/continued by pressing A/X.
The racket rotation can be changed by pressing thumbstick and moving it left or right. This will change the rotation with 15° steps.
Pressing both sticks/pads will reset the racket rotation to default."

2022-05-28 19:26:03.301656,MadameNay,Not much action,"It's great that it is free, but it's too hard to get the ball to volley.  If you can't afford to buy a tennis game, but want to play tennis, then give this a try because you have nothing to lose anyway. If you have money, then spend it on something that works. I'm VERY happy with   #SelfieTennis,  but I know there are other good ones, too.","Jun 16, 2018 at 9:04 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:26:03.329582,SET-VR,OK...so what'd I do?,"Maybe I forgot to wear my white clothes, or didn't stop for a quick Mimosa at the club house, or didn't sign up for the latest fund raiser project but all of a sudden, the game changed up on me. No more hands = no way to hold the raquet, or the ball, and the whole beach thing seems choppy. What's the story? Should I uninstall and reinstall?? Anyone else tick off the tennis gods?? Help, please!","Apr 30, 2018 at 7:11 PM",2, 0,"Hey, I am not sure what you are saying? Do you actually have a problem, or did you just not like the game very much, including the fact that you don't have any hands in the game (but ball and racket should be following your hands)? Reinstalling likely won't help, but is always worth a try."

2022-05-28 19:26:12.840143,neuro27,Free Tennis Demo,"The developer was great in responding to my problem in my original review and now the app is working for me. The app is fairly basic, but my biggest problem is that this is not actually tennis. The net is more like a volleyball net, so you have to aim higher than normal to get it across. This leads to a very frustrating volley. Also there's no ability to rotate your tennis racket in your hand, so ended up awkwardly holding the Touch controller in order to handle the racket as one actually would when playing. The AI is super hard, I was only able to score points by exploiting a trick where it got too close to the net and recoiled off of it. BTW, the secret achievement: hit the radio!!","Nov 1, 2017 at 5:16 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 19:26:15.949828,MaxwellRodgers,Tennis anyone?,"Honestly? You get what you pay for, a basic tennis game. I personally love it, its simple, nice music playing, and Blobby. It takes a few minutes to get used to how the game plays, but I picked it up fast. I tend to slam the serve and have learned to slow down. Blobby being the court ace it/he/she is, it's always fun to try to make the return back.","Jul 4, 2017 at 3:16 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:26:15.965784,c0nn0r,"very basic, but fun!","This is just a start of a tennis game, but it's alredy fun. I made a similar basic baseball game like this... Perhaps I should submit it to Oculus.","Aug 3, 2017 at 12:43 PM",3, 0,"Hey, thanks for your comment! It actually just started out as an old prototype I dug out and made to work again, which I then kept polishing because it was actually fun to play. And while the game is quite minimal, I spent a lot of time on the game engine and just wanted to get it out there to get to know the different distribution platforms and some feedback on any issues with my engine (which I got) and I am already working on something bigger :)"
2022-05-28 19:26:15.980744,Shon_t,It's free and fun...kinda,The physics are kinda blah...but I could see myself enjoying a simular game on the beach.,"Jul 14, 2017 at 4:40 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:26:15.995704,ericobnn,Needs work,"First, I appreciate that this game is free. But it's not very fun, because the physics are screwed up. I can send the tennis ball MUCH farther than I ever could in real life, and even weak swings will send the ball flying out of the opponents' court. After 10 minutes of trying, I got tired of repeatedly failing to adjust to my game character's massive strength (maybe he's Arnold Schwarzenegger?) and fouling 4 out of every 5 serves. Two minor complaints also is that the music is entirely mono to the right ear (it's supposed to simulate the boombox to the right side of the court, but it's annoying nonetheless) and the opponent's clarvoyant powers (he knows the MOMENT your racket touches the ball where the ball will fall [or not] inside his court, and moves/doesn't move accordingly).

I would never buy this game if it were paid.","May 17, 2017 at 5:30 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:26:19.097407,kbyte9001,It's free...,"Sometimes you get what you pay for.  If you love tennis, then you probably shouldn't get this game, it will ruin tennis for you.  If you want something free that you can waste 10 minutes on, then Blobby is for you.  The physics are hosed, and your strength is unmatched in the Blobby Universe.  There isn't much here, and it took me roughly 5 minutes to get the ball over the net and returned to me by Mr. Blobby. What else can I say except that this is free.","May 18, 2017 at 5:05 AM",2, 2,

The game uses DirectX 12 and as a result of that requires Windows 10 as stated in the requirements. I am not entirely sure if the Store lets you install it anyway. If this is not the problem it would be extremely helpful if you could send me some information about your system (dxdiag or whatever you are willing to give me) and a description of what exactly happens to support@slindev.com so I can hopefully figure it out and eventually release a fix.

2022-05-28 19:26:19.127327,cdroulers,Great proof of concept! Very enjoyable.,The physics are very realistic.
