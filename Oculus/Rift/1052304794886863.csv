So a 1050 or so should run well. The background is a little bit creepy.

Despite the app requirements of a GTX 1060 or higher, my 1050ti (and FX 8350) ran it very smoothly until I entered the settings options and then it crashed, simply avoid the settings and you'll be fine.

2022-05-28 19:12:21.029938,onceinAwhile,Massive download; fun games,"Overall enjoyable experience; some activities are fun; while others are a bit dull, mostly due to the controls, and not because of the activity itself. In one instance, you shoot objects flying out of a cannon; but you are too close to the scene and even stepping back does not give much room to aim properly. Much better with the shooting gallery, where you are at the right distance. The best one was archery; where you light up arrows and then fire at targets, some of which moves. It is a fun experience and graphics looks nice, even on a 980; although it is about 6 GB; not sure what is taking so much space, considering that the game won't win any graphics award, nor it last weeks.","Nov 17, 2017 at 11:01 AM",4, 0,

I'm no pro, but even I can throw a baseball or basketball harder than that. That said it is fun and you can keep going from game to game.

2022-05-28 19:12:27.313133,Renemouse,Fantastic and very replayable,"Really enjoyed this. Looks great and pushes your graphics card to the limit - default is low quality visuals but you can turn this up at the start. Note that it is designed for Nvidia cards and to make the most of it you need something powerful.

The game itself is a collection of fairground minigames, all presented nicely and enjoyable to play. Some are more fun than others but that's to be expected.
