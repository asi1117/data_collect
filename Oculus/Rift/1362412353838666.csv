Concept is nice but this is far from polished or a full game, hope this gets updated because I did enjoy what I was able to do.  

Just put in some locomotion, some more difficulty (as someone else said, just stand still and point your sword and most zombies will die) and other stuff.

But yeah, for less then a dollar..u can't go wrong.:p

2022-05-28 19:42:47.994359,cybernettr,,"Lots of scary monster-zombies. Fight Nazi zombies and slice the heads off the little blonde girl scouts. WARNING: This game really does want a big play space. Even resetting my view in Oculus just before a round didn't stop the game from wanting me to step farther forward than I really wanted to. To battle the big zombie, I had to step as far back as my room would allow and then step forward to my preferred play space to battle the zombie--still couldn't step as far as I would have liked. This game is both easy and hard--dead simple to understand, but hard to beat. I wish it didn't start you back at the beginning each time you lose. I would prefer to progress thru the game with a low score and work my way up than be reset at the beginning each time. (This is generally a trick short games use to make themselves seem longer)","Aug 16, 2017 at 8:55 AM",3, 1,
