2022-05-28 15:46:37.714803,TK9215,5/5 as a HORROR game!,I gave this game 5/5 based on the fact that's its truly TERRIFYING. As a horror game it deserves 5/5 because it's so HORRIFYING. It's honestly an extremely scary experience. As a game overall its probably 4/5 - but as a HORROR game I gave it a 5 because its so freaking scary.,"Feb 12, 2021 at 3:24 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 15:46:37.732754,AdmanOddman,Enjoyable game but can be buggy,"I am a fan of these short horror games that have good environments and a story to go with it, and this game is one of them. 

Some of the events in game actually gave me chills and the story had roped me in. However, I personally have experienced game breaking bugs that almost ruin the game for me. 

All in all I have enjoyed the game, but I just wish it went smoothly, so it would not lose the spark it has whilst playing through the chapters for the first time.","Jan 22, 2021 at 2:58 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:46:37.748712,Morphumax_Prime,"Good, but short","My main concern for the game is its length. I was able to 100% it in about 2 hours or less. And I wasn't rushing. I have to admit I was kind of disappointed at the end, and even the extra achievements didn't really add too much, especially in terms of rewards. But besides that, the game was good. It could be scarier, but that may be because I play a lot of scary games. But just be warned, if your looking for a long experience or something with some replay value, look elsewhere. If you want a quick, scary, one-off adventure, then go ahead. The game definitely had its moments, but unfortunatley didn't give me quite the scare (or length) i was looking for","Aug 17, 2020 at 7:51 AM",3, 12,

2022-05-28 15:46:40.920230,e1itegaming1,this is dumb,i got the game looking to be scared and it wont even load i uninstalled twice and all i see when i startup the game  is black,"Nov 28, 2019 at 6:20 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 15:46:40.935189,NeMewSys,It delivers!,"Pros: One of the most scary games for VR! Should include diapers.

Cons: The only issue I've face is the collision detection system. Sometimes you can go through objects, sometimes you get stuck in objects, and most severly you can go through objects and get stuck in a black screen (with no warning), in which case you need to restart the level.

A game that solves this collision issue reasonably well is Arizona Sunshine.","Sep 24, 2019 at 11:43 PM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 15:46:44.044871,SWAT27,Almost quit,"Too scared at points so it did its job and it did it well. I would describe gameplay mechanics but doing so would ruin the expereince.  Just know that it earned how much I paid for it, way scarier than any movie I've seen.

To explain the experience, this game is a different kind of scary. This is a ""You can defend yourself"" type of horror game, and although you are fully capable of doing so, you will NEVER feel in control due the atmosphere, not the mechanics themselves. It also DOES NOT rely on jumpscares (although few are present) and instead opts to fill you with dread. Then terror to make your heartrate spike. And then just more dread as you wait for the inevitable terror to begin anew. 

Most scared I've ever been, 10/10 for what they were aiming for, 8/10 as a game in general, 3 hours playtime for not 100% with replay. 

Just dig deep and push through.","Jun 2, 2019 at 1:08 PM",5, 24,
2022-05-28 15:46:44.058834,Muncheez_,It's Ok,"It's an ok scary game to play. I felt like the first level was the scariest if I had to choose. The other levels didn't give me any reactions or feelings. I feel like the levels could be longer as well. I wish they would've added a sprint, to get by some of the boring parts a little quicker. I guess they didn't add one to make you feel more scared from only being able to walk slowly. I get that but still, a sprint would've sped up some parts for me where I was almost yawning.","Jun 13, 2019 at 12:33 AM",3, 3,
