2022-05-28 17:20:01.852282,Diamonddude707,Throwing mechanics are garbo,"I came into this game ready for some fun. Its a really great concept, and I really tried to like it. But my GOD, the throwing mechanics are so painful! Literally, my arm hurts from throwing. The only thing that allows you to have SOME enjoyment is the slingshot, which doesnt last long, and without it, 95% of all of your shots wont even make it to the enemy fortress because it is ridiculusly hard to gain any distance on a throw whatsoever. Ive tried overhand, underhand, releasing early, releasing late, and by the time i finished the 7th level, I realized it just wasnt fun. Again, great concept, but the throwing just is not cooperating.","Aug 26, 2019 at 8:40 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 17:20:01.867242,Alex-Malex,Throwing is garbage,"The throwing physics are completely off, the snowball acts too heavy, if you throw normal it falls short and if you throw stronger it goes way further than it should. In a game entirely based around throwing, the random and sporadic behaviour of the ball is a big problem. It goes where it wants, and not the enemie fort. There is no calibration for throwing. Basically the poor controls and physics make the game impossible to enjoy.","Oct 28, 2019 at 9:13 AM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 17:20:01.908133,FastLawyer,I was cursing out Frosty the snowman!,"I haven't tried out the multiplayer.  I was going through the single player campaign and it's a lot of fun.  I'm not sure the base building is all that complex, but that freaking @#$@#$ Frosty the $#@$@#$# Snoman is a real $#@$#@$@#.  He's a freaking cheater.  He gangs up on you.  Two against one, are you freaking kidding me?  Who knew Frosty was such a $#@$@#!!!  Rating 8/10 would curse out Frosty again ... and please add me so we can multiplayer, I swear I won't curse you out unless you're a cheater like Frosty the #$@$#$@!#!!","Dec 8, 2017 at 3:00 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:20:01.923093,Chiara,"Polished and fun, deserves more love","This game has three modes: 1. you build a snow fort out of snow cubes and then take out a snowman who is hiding behind its own fort; 2. you take out waves of approaching snowmen while using your snow fort for cover; 3. you are responsible for setting up the snow fort and maintaining it while your snowmen fight off waves (my personal favorite). It's really polished, with some beautiful and distinctive art direction, very little aliasing (except on the instruction sheet), and the helper character Fox is actually adorable and not annoying. Unfortunately there are so few players right now that I couldn't try multiplayer. My only small complaints were that it doesn't appear to use Rift audio by default, so you have to set Rift audio as default device; and that it's a bit difficult to squeeze a snow cube into a tight space, which is important for a secure fort. Occasionally, I was able to get the physics into an unstable equilibrium where I'd constantly hear sounds of cubes colliding with one another.","Dec 29, 2016 at 3:57 AM",4, 24,
