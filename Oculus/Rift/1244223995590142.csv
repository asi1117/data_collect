2022-05-28 17:50:31.663709,ShrunkenQuasar,Not worth the download,"Graphics look like a 90s game, and the game doesn't support some buttons on the Xbox gamepad that comes with the Rift, meaning you can't fire your weapons.","Nov 21, 2017 at 1:08 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 17:50:31.677672,rousejeremy,not a good game. at all,"can't map some controller buttons, bad graphics, really bad, boring.","Dec 7, 2017 at 4:12 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 17:50:31.693629,Ozylanthe,Not worth the download,"Good tech demo, poorly thought out controls, slow fire velocity and not very fun.","Oct 18, 2017 at 10:20 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 17:50:31.708590,neuro27,Poor man's EVE,"If I had to sum this game up, it would be a cheap version of EVE: Valkyrie. But it is also a pretty good game in its own right. With several missions to complete as well as multiplayer battles and missions, there is lots here to keep you amused for a while at least. OK, so it doesn’t look amazing and the motion sickness will bring most people to the point of vomiting, but sit in a comfortable chair and you will soon believe you really are taking place in a giant space battle. This game makes it possible to be fully immersed within it and that is why it is worth a download. Space shooters simply work well in VR and the more the merrier.","May 21, 2017 at 12:23 AM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 17:50:34.808299,SoffiantiniThomas,It's just me or something?,"Stuck in the tutorial phase, where asked to shoot down drones in the asteroid field: they are spawning endlessly... however, the idea is good - it lacks everything else.","Apr 19, 2017 at 12:07 AM",3, 4,You're playing the practice mode which is intentionally endless. There's a separate tutorial with an instructor who guides you through how to pilot the ship.
2022-05-28 17:50:34.823259,JD2jr,Pretty Decent,"Played for a good hour. Felt like it had potential, but there was a multiplayer option and I think all the ""players"" were just bots? Set up my own lobby and no one entered in an entire 10/15 min round. There seemed to be ""doors"" to fly to (were marked as waypoints) but they didn't open/do anything. Most maps were limited to 1 big structure in the middle. Needed a touch more variety. Overall, it needs to be polished a little and it would be great.","Mar 28, 2017 at 9:56 AM",4, 2,
