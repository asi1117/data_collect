2022-05-28 18:53:35.798529,rchrdcrg,Meh...,"I honestly wanted to love this game so much as someone who grew up in the arcades of the 80s and 90s, and I think what they've done here is incredibly clever... but PhilOnGames puts it perfectly with the realization that games like Robo Recall (and the 900 VR wave/rail shooters out there) are basically VR versions of the same type of game. If this did a better job of capturing the true nostalgia of the original arcade experience juxtaposed with modern VR segments, that would be neat, but it seems to try too hard to be both without any true identity. Also there hasn't been any kind of update or love shown for this game in a long long long time.
On top of all of this, the game is just kinda boring as sh*t.","Dec 30, 2020 at 4:18 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:35.812492,muq45,Very enjoyable casual game.,Like walking into an arcade and picking up a gun and shooting the screen. very simple may not be a ton of options but its just like it is if you go to an arcade. Id buy again even looking at some of the reviews. People expecting too much when it is what it is. Just an arcade shooter. Love it though!,"Jun 13, 2020 at 4:07 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:53:35.827452,PhilOnGames,Good concept on paper,"savagebeasty's review captures my thoughts perfectly. If you want the classic lightgun arcade experience within VR, wait for something else, or just play Robo Recall and realize it's essentially a modern version of these old arcade shooters anyway.","Jun 7, 2020 at 2:00 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:35.841415,HarbingerThrace,Would have given it 5 starts but,"(updated)
I originally gave it 4 stars but now I am changing it to 1 star.  Ivanovich (the developer) was really dismissive and unhelpful when I contacted them on Facebook about some glitches in the game.   They made a great game, but when the support is so lacking it leaves a bad experience for the client.  They refused to even look into the glitches at all.

(original review)
I was disappointed that the Ivanovich (the developer) didn't seem that interested in answering my question about whether this game supported Oculus cloud saving.  I was essentially told by Ivanovich  that they are just a small team of 4 people and only answer queries about critical glitches.  Especially if they are a team of 4 at least one of them should know the answer since when I asked Oculus they said it is up to the developers to opt in to cloud saving so they would know.

Other than that the game is a ton of fun and would have given it 5 stars were it not for the kind of rude response I got when I reached out.  It is a really creative use of vr.  Just hope the developers give their customers a bit more effort when we reach out.","Dec 1, 2019 at 12:56 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 18:53:35.856374,savagebeasty,No....,"Terrible........just utter terrible........

Two modes - neither make sense...

Arcade Mode:

So I'm in a VR Arcade with the usual VR depth..arcade cabinets all in 3d loveliness....nice this is looking good.....hang on...what's this...I'm playing a cabinet where the screen is flat...whilst the room around me is in VR 3d.....what is this meta hell I've uncovered.......

Maybe if I press this '3DTV' button on the top of the cabinet it'll all make sense....oh sweeett jeezus it feels like I've just had every orifice of my soul invaded from the inside out.......


'Immersive' Mode:

ok so this will be more like what I'm expecting...sure the other mode was just a bit gimicky we'll let that slide...this will be...you know operation wolf style..like the title suggests.....in the game , shooting endless enemies and tanks in some mindless violence fun.....

oh wait what's going on here.........I seem to be in a 3D VR room.......and there's a sort of giant screen in front of me...where the game is playing....this time in 3D with depth...but i'm the size of a god......looking down on these tiny rubbish soldiers spawning in my eyeline.....i shoot them...they ragdoll quite poorly....

Why am I in this room....have I finally lost all grip of reality and now I only exist in some caged off area of my mind, 3 levels deep in meta befuddlement....

Why am i this big....why are they so small....why am i not in the fooking game itself......

Then all of a sudden a pickup is shot....and I'm transported into the game itself....and it all turns into what you thought it was going to be in the 1st place...i'm in the game....its (sort of) like operation wolf....it's still total gash and feels like something knocked up in UE4 with a spagetti of fudged blueprints in about 2 hours....but at least i'm there...

For a fleeting moment it was like it should be...then I'm transported back to the cage of befuddlement to become a god again spunking boring death on tiny little men...

2022-05-28 18:53:38.982015,Falcon_DS_,Just Fun,I tried the free demo on Steam and was gutted when it finished.  Just had to buy it here when I saw it on sale!  :-),"Sep 1, 2019 at 11:52 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:53:38.996975,Aphasia_CM,Really a lot of fun,"I wasn't sure about this at first, but as soon as I tried it I was grinning from ear to ear.  Very nostalgic while also very fresh... My only complaint is that the ""immersion point"" controls are not very intuitive and sometimes take several tries just to figure out -- I died in the immersion before I understood what was happening.  It'd be great if they added a ""training mode"" where you could just experience those controls before playing through the missions, or something.  But still very much worth it.","Jul 5, 2019 at 12:29 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:53:39.026894,Forbidden76,Great game,"First game I bought for my Rift. Mainly because it was on sale but sounded fun and I loved Operation Wolf as a kid in the arcades! This litterly shoves your head into the monitor and you hold a uzi or sometimes two and can throw grenades. Special weapons are a blast to play with like sniper rifle, bow arrow and rocket launcher. You can even fly a Heli or Jet! Must buy for me.","Nov 21, 2018 at 9:38 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:53:39.040857,Nameless4Now,Very Cool Retro Feel!,"Amazing use of VR, as you feel your right in the game, from the veiw point of the gun! Cool upgrades, cool weapons, very immersive, also like the 3rd person perspective when you shoot selected targets. Overall very solid shooter with a retro feel!!","Nov 15, 2018 at 4:52 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:53:42.156524,RuneSR2,Not very interesting,"I didn't experience any technical problems, I guess I just wasn't fond of the gameplay. Texture quality, lighting and levels of on-screen polys didn't really amaze me either, everything looked kind of dated. Mostly I was just standing shooting soldiers, it felt very repetitive and not very inspiring (I greatly dislike rail shooters, and this game greatly feels like a rail shooter). Maybe I expected too much, unfortunately this game failed to impress me.","Nov 10, 2018 at 4:44 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 18:53:42.185446,theconkerer,This Might Be My Number One Game!,"Got this on sale for $10. After playing it, I'd say it is worth the full asking price. There is a great amount of variety in the gameplay. It's sort of an on rails shooter but keeps you on your toes. You'll drive vehicles, fly in helicopters, snipe enemies, and much more. I like that I can pick up and play for a few minutes and put it down. The music and sounds are great! Plenty of different weapons to play around with. I used to play Operation Wolf as a kid on NES, and love the nostalgia this game brings. Developers did a great job here, can't wait to see more from them.","Jul 30, 2018 at 12:22 AM",5, 3,

I also appreciate the amount of content (new levels, upgrades, etc.)  that will keep this game from getting stale quickly.  Great job development team!!","Jul 28, 2018 at 12:04 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:53:42.216364,All-Gass-No-Breaks,Operation Wolf,"This is operation wolf! Sort of.. It don't take it's self seriously, And at first I just wanted operation wolf in VR as I love the game. But.... After playing this, Its just so much fun. You get crazy power ups like freeze grande or gravity gun and at first I thought this was a bad thing and not what I wanted, But after playing it, for some reason, It just Works and is so much fun. You get given 3 goals for each mission like get 5 head shoots or free 3 prisoners of war and so on, For your efforts you get rewarded points/stars that you can use to upgrade your arsenal/weapons, You can then go back to a level you could not complete with your new gear and do some damage. Dont miss this if your an old school arcade gamer, You can bring back them good old arcade feelings from the 80's/90's. Someone build me a time machine. I want to go home.","Jun 18, 2018 at 7:15 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:53:45.344996,HoodyNynja,Arcade Inception,"Full Review - https://youtu.be/WSaKiX4dQO0

Video game inception!  PLay a video game, that transports you to an arcade, to play a videogame, that transports you to another world. On-rails shooter on 'roids, with ""imersion points"" that not only put you in the middle of the action, but also change how your play the game.

Some immersion points take some getting used to, such as flying a jet, and you can't practice them outside of the normal levels, but levels are short enough that you don't get fatigued playing them over and over.

NOTE: There  are two different versions (arcade cabinets) of the game.  The one on the left has more of an ""arcade mode"" feel, whereas the one on the right is more designed around challenge and scores.","Jun 5, 2018 at 10:02 AM",5, 1,
