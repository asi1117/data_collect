2022-05-28 20:07:44.262961,TaunHawk,Demeo House Rules Mod made it enjoyable,"Our Demeo group of 12 players have all had a chance to test out different rulesets in the unofficial Demeo House Rules Mod created by Orendain. The best pre-defined ruleset that almost all of our player group agrees on is the ""No surprises in the dark or coming through doors."" The limitations are: no monster respawns and monsters cannot open doors. This made all three campaigns very enjoyable and more tactical. We felt it made the least amount of changes to the base game. We still would wipe from bad decisions or miscalculated steps, but it felt more like it was our fault and not an unfair random behavior of the game. I hope this option will eventually be available in the base game without a mod. Demeo could apply any optional reduction in difficulty to also reduce the amount of xp gained for campaign completion.

Details about House Rules Mod and downloads can be found here: https://github.com/orendain/DemeoMods/wiki/House-Rules",Mar 9 at 6:19 PM,4, 29,
2022-05-28 20:07:44.278918,Willard007,Losing cards (not sure when it started),"I think this has happened before once or twice but, one day, I continued a saved game of The Rat King after getting through the first level the previous day.  I managed to come through with a few extra pets and conjured up more (not sure if that is relevant).  I was playing single skirmish with 3 Hunters and one Assassin and I filled up 3 of the 4 players’ hands buying cards.  I know that at least one time I tried playing a Hail of Arrows card and it seemed to just disappear.  I thought maybe I had tried grabbing it from a team member’s hand whose turn had just ended but then I noticed the player had one action left so that was not the case.  So I lost the card and an action point.  It happened at least one other time in this same session.

It happened again.  This time on the Roots of Evil 3rd level continued after saving the night before.  I was trying to play a Heaven’s Fury twice but maybe it was not a legal square and then it disappeared and one of my action points also went away.  There was no die to throw and no swords falling from the sky.

It would be nice to see the cards your other players have in their hands before deciding what to do when playing a Skirmish.  Also would think, if you revive a character, that s/he might be able to take their turn rather than having to skip a turn when normally, the playing order determines it (this is not a show stopper.  Just wondered if this might be considered).

Definitely a fun game, though.

- another thought: is it possible or would you consider allowing two players to each control 2 characters in a 4 character party?",Apr 10 at 7:50 AM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:07:44.293878,prince_hamlet,Best Dungeon Crawler,"I was skeptical, but this turned into my favorite VR game. It's a turn-based tactical dungeon crawler that plays well solo and in co-op. The monsters/levels are randomized to make multiple playthroughs enjoyable. The UX is superb and has minimal controls that don't get in the way of the immersion. Just a first rate implemenation of a fun, tactical game.",Apr 9 at 5:58 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:07:44.316817,JimLiminal,"Needs 2 player, 2 characters each",This game is great! Single player skirmish mode is just as much fun as the multiplayer. I cant wait for more stories and characters to get released.,Apr 16 at 10:50 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:07:44.331777,Mordenkainen68,PC Version Update Killed VR Version,Ever since the pc version update the game kicks me out of VR and into the pc version after about 15 - 20 minutes of gameplay.  It won't let me continue in VR or on the pc.  All I can do is exit the game.,Apr 15 at 8:59 PM,1, 0,"Sorry to hear that you had to experience this.

2022-05-28 20:07:47.468546,Kryme,PC Edition HDR Saturation bugged???,"UPDATE: I had to uninstall and reinstall a few times, but I did get the game to work with HDR eventually.  To be honest, maybe it was an Oculus Launcher issues, maybe the horrid Windows HDR implementation or maybe it was DEMEO, but in any case, I recently played another round in HDR and it worked great.  I'm changing my review to 4/5.

Issue I still have...2 player rounds are next to useless.  Please implement a method where 2 players can control 2 characters.
-----------------------------------------------
I enjoy the VR version; however, with HDR enabled in Win and my monitor and in game, I have horrible oversaturation of colors...happy to provide a screenshot if needed.  I see that on/about 8 April a Hotfix was applied to fix this issues for Steam Users...was this update also applied to Oculus users?  Looking for some help here.",8 days ago,4, 1,"Hello!

2022-05-28 20:07:47.491477,ChickenLipzz,Best Digital Dungeon Crawler Available!!,"Perhaps the best ditigal version of a board game ever.   With the upcoming roadmap items like cross play to PC (steam version releases on April 7th 2022), PvP mode and new adventures, this is THEE game to play as a dungeon crawler.  The details on the figs, the multi-level dungeon maps, the simple game mechanics (that can lead to some great strategy) make this a MUST HAVE!!!",Jan 27 at 6:07 AM,5, 3,

2022-05-28 20:07:47.533366,AngryMuppet420,So much FUN!,"Very sweet little game for solo or multiplayer. Have already spent hours on this  game and can imagine many many more in future. graphics are great and i love the character design etc.
My ONLY real gripe is, as many have pointed out, there SHOULD be the ability to give players control of more than one character to fill out a party! Many people dont enjoy the random stranger games and therefore need several available friends. (not always feasible)
Thanks for the great game tho. looking forward to future modules!",11 days ago,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:07:50.638741,HobanWash,Great Co-op Fun!,This is one of the best vr games out to date. It is a blast to play single player or coop and is highly interactive. It has a ton of replayability and we have had a blast playing with friends. Worth the time and money and easily recoommendable to all.

2022-05-28 20:07:50.684618,CainReval,Addicting! Absolutely in Love 🥰,"I love DnD, I DM alot for my friends, but I also love to play. I don't have actual minis of my characters, or a real map to play on with DnD, so this experience is so cool and really gets me in that kind of mood. Love the aesthetic and everything, I can't get enough of it. I want more!!! More classes, abilities, campaigns. It would be really cool to add some sort of ""Dungeon Maker"" mode where you can create your own 3 stage levels with enemies you pick or with a set theme, or what not. I can't imagine it would be a simple task, but it would definitely keep the game fresh, especially if you could download other people's creations. As of right now, the amount of content is pretty low, but I know so many people would get on bard if a feature like this were implemented! People could have full on campaigns in here! Thanks for making an incredible game anyways!",Oct 13 at 5:11 AM,5, 31,

Misses on dice rolls are supposed to be a 1 in 12 chance but happens about 25% of the time, and even more in crucial moments. This is not a perception thing as I have demonstrated it for friends.

2022-05-28 20:07:57.019960,mariopluto,its a good game.. BUT....,"recently there has been an ""update"" so you cannot play multiplayer. apperently you need to download it online? there are no instructions form the developers from what ive seen. from everything else i would really recommend. but untill they fix it i cant give it a 5 star.",Aug 10 at 2:44 PM,4, 10,"Hi there! The reason you need to update is to make sure that all players are on the same version of the game so everyone can play with each other. The update was simply to add support for an upcoming Oculus feature, so nothing has changed in the game. All updates (for all apps) require an internet connection to be downloaded.

2022-05-28 20:07:57.036914,Glimmers,Rat king ruined this game,"Overall, a great platform with tons of potential.  It started out too easy, I was level 45 in a week.  Super addictive play...but...this expansion took difficulty too much to the other extreme.  Now it's not even fun to play.  Mobs can shoot you from across the map through the smallest little opening in these overly complicated maps, you can't see them, they implimented a darkness system whereby the enemies can see and kill you, but you can't see them.  It's not like elves have night vision or anything.  If you dare walk across a walkway without complete wall coverage prepare to be downed at the end of your turn as half the map will shoot you from places you can't even see.  I don't know if the success just went to their head or what, but they took a good game and wrecked it.  Hopefully future tweaks and patches can bring it back into a 5 star experience.  It's still worth the money, but expect to get frustrated with the new content.",Jul 3 at 12:53 AM,1, 44,
2022-05-28 20:07:57.051874,OldDirtyRob,"Repetitive, Terrible player base","The game is ok, similar to a melee X-com 2. The discord community is probably the worst online community I have seen. At least in pop 1, onward, contractors you know the drill. You're gonna be muting or talking smack, but this.... this is full of bible camp counselors. So much worse. MUCH WORSE. You are going to hear Richard Cheney jokes, awful tv version clean joke Lester from GTA 5 , JimBob from accounting telling you the best way to play your wizard in that midwest nasal twang. And now for the most machiavellian twist of all... it is only fun with other people. I actually went on to Discord to find some non mouth breathers and it was so much worse. I give 2 stars instead of 1 because the Demeo Discord was an entertaining battle against unwinnable odds, kind of what the game could've been.... Had some laughs was worth the cash. I should add I am banned from the Discord now? Because of this review? I am not sure why, guess I will bump it down to one star....",Aug 19 at 12:53 AM,1, 8,

I cannot even begin to describe how sad I was to come and find out that there wasnt a great VR board game experience on quest... well this changed that!  Its so much fun to play with friends across the country in a way that truly feels like your sitting at the table and hanging out.  The mobs and player tokens are very well detailed, all of the awesome particle effects you normally only see on PCVR are also fully available (and look GREAT) on native/standalone quest 2.  10/10 I have been and will continue to recommend this game to absolutely everyone.
