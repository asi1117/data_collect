2022-05-28 20:29:31.050202,SifuKyle,worth the dollar,i did not expect the game to be this much fun. the tavern fight was a bit more challenging than it needed to be because people were in the dark and i also couldn't see where i was aiming. whish there was a way to turn up the brightness. probably the best dollar i've ever spent.,"Sep 17, 2020 at 4:10 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:29:31.065161,Kristoff63,Woman on the Train,"Great game, quite a bit of fun to be had BUT is it possible to kill the shooter
on the train, having killed the two ladies on the platform or is that your polite
way of saying ""That's it...End of game""","Aug 30, 2020 at 5:55 AM",5, 0,"This is now fixed.
Thanks for the bug report!"
2022-05-28 20:29:31.081118,neilykins69,As the previous guy said....,"Great game. It doesn't matter that the graphics aren't AAA, it's fun, it runs like a dream and I get to be Clint Eastwood. If you're umming and arring wondering whether to spend a few quid on this little western shooter gem.... just get a grip and buy it.","Jul 8, 2020 at 8:04 PM",5, 5,Thanks! :-)
2022-05-28 20:29:31.097076,TheUsualSuspect,Great game for the price,"I would highly recommend Revolver Widow as part of everyones gaming library.

I bought Revolver Widow because it was cheap and looked fun, I wasn't disappointed. It's very simple, very addictive and my kids love it to. 

After a couple of visual apps this is one of the first games I show to friends and family who haven't used VR before. Great fun and no motion sickness. 

Just need to know how to kill that guy on the train?!?","Jun 29, 2020 at 12:03 AM",5, 2,Thanks! The issue with the enemy on the train has been fixed in the latest version.
2022-05-28 20:29:31.113033,EddieNanakase,Big punch in a small package,"I really liked the game for several reasons. It has a beginning, an end, interesting characters, great voice acting, nice music and interesting scenes.  The graphics are very simple, which makes the game run smooth.   The developer was right, it's nice that your opponents do wait a little to draw, but in doing so, you do appreciate the scenery more.  I gave it five stars because it is a fun little game, but most importantly, it's fairly priced.  It doesn't takes up that much space in your PC.  I'm so glad to have it on my library !","Apr 28, 2020 at 3:35 PM",5, 3,Thanks!
2022-05-28 20:29:34.207873,Roger_Maddy,Revolver Widow Iron Plate?,"I've been taking a break from all the coronavirus noise on the Internet... playing this game.

I purchased the game because the bad guys and girls are wearing COVID-19 face-coverings, which are in style.

Now here's my question:
What is the ""Iron Plate"" in the game?","Apr 15, 2020 at 3:16 AM",4, 3,"Thanks your review made me laugh. The ""Iron Plate"" is a primitive form of body armor. (It acts as an extra life.)"
2022-05-28 20:29:34.223831,FelicityC,cute little game,"cute game for the price, some suggestions from a classical western duel lover:

the bandits were always the one who drew their gun first. part of the fun of the western duel is that tense concentration needed to draw second and still shoot first, since the person who draws first is gonna be the outlaw. so perhaps setting them to draw in a specific speed (ie: easier enemies should take up to a full second or two to draw their weapon and aim fully, and the boss should take much less time, scaled to focus on reaction time moreso than straight up quickness and accuracy. waiting for them to draw and if you draw first, you get a foul and must restart. 

i actually waited so long in the first duel because of expecting the first enemy to do this lol. in ng+ obviously they try are quicker to aim, but it's still not quite the same.

otherwise, fun cute game, nice cute twist, controls are fine and can't complain for the price. would be 5 stars and a great reaction time trainer if you made it more like a real (well: fantasy real) revolver duel system","Apr 14, 2020 at 10:26 AM",4, 3,"Thanks for the great feedback. If you wait long enough they will draw on you (and when they do they're slower than if you draw first). In early versions of the game they would draw on you sooner than they do now, but some players complained they didn't have time to look around and admire the scenery before getting shot. Most enemies draw faster each time you complete a round in New Game+."
2022-05-28 20:29:34.239788,biancadelrio,This is a great little game.,"It is short but still fun and there is a game+.
@dev : could you please add an option for left handed people ? ;) i have to switch my controllers for the moment : it works but this is not optimal. Thank you :)","Apr 22, 2020 at 4:40 PM",4, 1,Thanks! Left handed play is now supported. (You can now dual wield with one revolver in each hand.)
2022-05-28 20:29:34.254748,veesalazar,Decent Game,If you are looking for a simple 1 person shooter game this one is a decent and really easy one. I like it.,"Apr 17, 2020 at 2:37 PM",4, 2,Thanks!
2022-05-28 20:29:34.270706,taquitobuddy,There's a reason this costs like 50 cent,Because it isn't very good.,"Apr 5, 2020 at 9:36 AM",1, 2,Thanks for taking the time to write a review. What didn't you like about the game? What would make it better?
2022-05-28 20:29:37.379485,FastLawyer,It's okay for the price,"I got it for .99 cents. I would say that's about the right price for this. It's okay for what it is. A little quick & dirty game of draw first like a savage and shoot everyone or wait until the bad guy draws first like a civilized person and then shoot and kill everyone. There is no locomotion. On some scenes you just stand in your one spot, however, there are some where you are on a moving platform. If it moves, it's a bad guy so you shoot it. Since your'e the good ""person"" you're bullets don't lie about that point. Western justice at its finest.","May 17, 2020 at 12:31 AM",3, 0,
