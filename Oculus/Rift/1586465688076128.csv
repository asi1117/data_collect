2022-05-28 15:42:14.765560,AxelMarx,Tantalisingly Close,"There's the bones of a pretty good game here, but it lacks the refinements it deserves. The game is controlable (barely) with touch controllers , but you invariably end up with your flight-stick hand held out at weird uncomfortable angles, as there seems to be no correlation between leveling out and returning your hand to it's start postion. The mapping for a controller / HOTAS is awful, I was reduced to having to chug my way through every input setting for every axis (with a lot of tedieous crashing in the process) to finally wrangle a Saitek X52 into playing nice with this thing, despite it purpotedly being able to auto detect that model. Once I got my settings saved, things improved imeasuarbly (other than the random occasions when I launch the game and it flatly refuses to beleive there's an X52 attached to it, despite other games like Elite Dangerous having no issue seeing it immediately after).
Once you get up in the air and able to control your craft, things start getting good here, there's a compelling premise, and the graphics (albeit nothing to write home about) are good enough. Unfortunately the mission designs are lacking. Objectives are sometimes obscure, and there are some truely baffling design descisions. i.e. You start on foot on a carrier deck with two aircraft and 1 boat) to chose from (1 fighter jet, 1 attack helicipter). Get shot down, or crash and you're back on the deck to take off in your second choice. Lose this one and you're pointlessly dumped back on the deck, with no more aircraft to fly. There are random pickups in game where you can pick up another plane, but fail to get one & you're left stood on the deck like a lemon with your thumb up your proverbial, with literally nothing to do. No mission failed sequence, until the aliens eventually destroy the carrier, no cooldown period for new planes spawning, just chirping crickets and tumbleweed. Three stars because when it's good, it's genuinely good, but when it's bad it's aweful.","May 9, 2021 at 9:50 PM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:42:14.780521,RaventheGrave,Awesome,"So this game is simple with only a few levels and somewhat similar scenarios but it's fun for what it is and for $20 not bad in my book. My only complaint is that I've gotten stuck using the ship and unable to go anywhere due to engine failure and since you can't just jump out of the boat and swim back or spawn back at the ship i had to just restart. Having to re arm anmo, fuel and repairs is cool for a touch of realism and each plane handles differently which is also cool. Not to mention the damage to your vehicles is realistic as if you take certain damage you can't accelerate more or use your weapons which is neat.. Got a bit of sea sickness after losing engine power in the boat and only being able to spin in circles. Happened once flying the chopper as well, lost all control and could oy spin around in circles until I crashed.","Apr 20, 2021 at 1:29 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:42:14.795480,Jelly_xy,*SIGH*,"My previous review was five stars... But... I've only been running into more and more issues. The joystick and throttle support on this game hardly works. Ill map the buttons and then anywhere from 30 seconds after take-off too a few minutes my stick goes dead (this does happen in any other game.) And while shooting (regardless of the input) its like the game is having trouble regestering the button press and shoots as though the gun is having a seizure. This game has amazing potential but I'd really hope to see a fix for the joystick support. Another issues is when mapping buttons the select button gets mapped if i dont push another button fast enough. It would be advisable to have it so that if nothing is pressed (AFTER SELECTION) nothing is mapped/or have it just wait until the player presses the button on there own. I've had to uninstal the game a few times because the seizure trigger was rapid fire selecting things and mapping the menu and select buttons to the the same trigger. Then theres the boats. Enemies can hit you fine when youre moving. when they do enough damage you cant move the boat anymore, but enemies magically dont shoot you anymore so you usually end up having to restart the match. It would be nice to have a bailout feature added. This game has so much potential but until i can run it with a joystick I'm afraid my rating will stay at 2 stars instead of 5.","Jan 14, 2021 at 1:28 PM",2, 4,"What is happening is your aircraft has been damaged. You can see the status of your aircraft, along with fuel and ammunition, on the status-display. Make sure all lights are green, and if not, pick up a repair-powerup by flowing into it. They are on the carrier and respawn every 2 minutes, and can also be dropped by enemies. If you hear a beeping sound, that is likely due to you running out of fuel, so keep track of your fuel-level also. Your aircraft can be damaged on individual control-surfaces, fuel-tanks (fuel depletes faster), gun (they intermittently jam, like you describe). Thank you for the detailed feedback!"

2022-05-28 15:42:14.824403,Airwolf617,It's Fixed and It's Awesome!!!!,"Excellent game!

If you want a flying combat game in VR, then look no further!. I have managed to run my Pro flight rudder pedals and my Saitek X52 UNDER AUTO DETECT. However I could not get this to work via steam. It worls via the oculus store though.

Love some updates featuring hellfire or an AH-64D OR E Apache. Happy to pay for it. Loving the Alien stuff. However i'd be happy with something like Desert Storm, where you have to fly in and take out the radar sites, tanks, etc. Level 1 of the classic Desert Strike would be a great start.

If people are having problems with the controls. The issues are the that the motion needs turning off as that is what affects the controls causing them to be sluggish/conflict with the thumb sticks.","Aug 25, 2020 at 11:26 PM",5, 8,
