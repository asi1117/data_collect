One thing: The joystick motion is fixed to the original forward orientation, rather than ""forward"" being whatever direction you are looking. If this was intentional, I would argue against it. If it is a goof, then, just so you know","Mar 11, 2021 at 10:42 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:48:21.004391,FastLawyer,Art Masterpiece,"One of the truly great pieces of art made with Virtual Reality in mind. What a journey. Whole expeirence takes about 20 minutes, although you can definitely take longer than that to enjoy each single piece individually. Bravo to Ignacio Farias! Hope to see another one of these from you!","Feb 22, 2020 at 9:06 AM",5, 0,"Thank you so much! You can actually download The OmniGallery, a virtual museum with great paintings and sculptures from famous artists like Michelangelo or van Gogh. Im currently working on the next exhibit, which should be ready in a couple months."

I feel that whoever created the parts in between the paintings, the trippy tunnel stuff, had some psychedelic experience","Nov 24, 2019 at 5:23 AM",5, 1,"Thanks haha and I dont know these psychedelics you are talking about, but I have definitely never tried them *wink *wink"
2022-05-28 19:48:21.043288,Artist3d,Ok... Well That was a Mind Warp...,"As a fellow artist I endorse this kind of madness for the shear imagination and audacity of it! To explore the frontiers of where art can go, captivate and delight. Congratulations to Ignacio for a pleasantly surprising little series of trippy little paintings all displayed in a wonderfully unique and interactive way. I look forward to further 'installations' and such an affordable price too, when the real price of admission, I dare say... is your mind! XLNT.","Jul 31, 2019 at 2:21 PM",5, 1,Thank you so much!! (I wish Oculus would notify me when people comment). With this one I was really trying to push the envelope. Check out The OmniGallery! is my next project where Im trying to gather the best art from all places into a multiverse of exhibits. The first one is already available and free!
