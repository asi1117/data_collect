2022-05-28 11:25:36.731033,funnywheeno,There IS a left-handed mode.,"I accidentally switched into it and now I don't know how to get back out of it. It must have been a gesture/button combo or something.

I'm missing a feature that quill has, which is to be able to to import equirectangular images for reference. Also, I think it would be important to be able to nudge things around. When you're sculpting, and your sculpture consists of hundreds of strokes, it becomes rather impossible to fix proportions later. Indeed, painting with multiple people at the same time would be wonderful! Definitely more exporting options are needed (a lot more!) And a few more realistic brushes. It would also be really cool if we could turn 3d models into guides so that we can essentially paint them and then delete the model underneath.

I love that you can color pick from a reference photo! 

But devs, I would argue that there's a use case for using VR to make 2D painting engines more intuitive to use than tablets. You know.. with blending and water colors and such. It doesn't HAVE to be a 3D painting.","Dec 8, 2020 at 8:34 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 11:25:52.623552,LuluViBritannia,Among the best VR softwares!,"Tilt Brush is a masterpiece. This is not a game : this is an art software, where you can draw/paint in the virtual space. Basically it's a ""Photoshop in VR"" (though both softwares are actually quite different). Not only the concept is unique (try to draw in thin air out of VR...), Tilt Brush also offers a lot of tools (especially compared to its opponents like Oculus Quill). I would say we have about 30 different brushes (from simple markers to beautiful visual effects like fire, ember, stars, hyper color, light pen, and many more!!!), plus a color change (obviously), plus some geometric guides (to draw perfect cubes or spheres for example), plus some export systems like the share system, or a camera (you can take pictures or video of your scenes). Besides, the graphics are gorgeous! Google apps have the best light effects in VR so far. The only thing missing is a virtual keyboard to type the names of the files (all my files are called ""UntitledXX""...), and a multiplayer support (how fun it could be to draw with friends in real time!!!). Otherwise, Tilt Brush is perfect, because not only it is gorgeous, it also offers a lot of tools, with which we can do plenty of things as long as we are creative enough (which is not really my case, lol).","Nov 19, 2017 at 11:36 PM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 11:25:58.909933,Duncan_Disorderly,Can you compare?,"After having the benefit of trying Medium, Quill and most recently, Tilt Brush, it's difficult to say which is best. In fact, I don't see how you can compare them. All three have their own appeal, in their own unique way. Medium, for a start, is more about sculpting, since it's a bit like working with clay. Whereas Quill and Tilt Brush is more like working with ink. That said, they both approach it in slightly different ways. Tilt Brush seems to focus more on drawing with effects, like drawing a line on fire, with smoke or snowflakes constantly falling. Quill has a limited choice in comparison and hardly no effects like Tilt Brush. The only thing I didn't like about Tilt Brush is the exclusion of an ability to use layers. Layers form a part of Medium and Quill's features and I find it more of a necessity over a luxury, especially nowadays since it's a ubiquitous feature. Apart from that, I love all three for simply doing their own thing and enjoy using them equally. I find myself using the different apps depending on the mood of the day. One day, I'm drawn to Quill. Who knows how I'll feel tomorrow. Perhaps I'll be drawn to Quill again. Perhaps Medium. Having this variety of choice is actually the best part about it. So, if you want to know which is best, get all three. That's the best option, in my opinion.","Jul 7, 2017 at 8:33 PM",5, 57,

For instance, Tilt Brush has several animated brushes (like a fire brush). There are pre-made environments and objects in Tilt Brush. There is one big thing that Tilt Brush is missing that Quill has: layers. This is actually a pretty big deal, in my opinion. The ability to have layers makes your work much easier and more flexible. Also, Quill has made the editing process simpler by taking better advantage of the touch controllers. To undo something you simply swipe back on the thumb stick. To delete something you simply move your controller over it and press B. Once you know how to do things like this in Quill it makes editing a breeze. Tilt Brush feels like a slower process, breaking your flow, by making you flip to the menu and hitting the undo button. Still, I think this program is worth the money and I'm glad Google brought it to Oculus! PS: Both Tilt Brush and Quill are missing an obvious feature: shared canvas! Allow multiple people to use the same art-space simultaneously!","Feb 22, 2017 at 4:16 AM",4, 105,
2022-05-28 11:26:05.244712,TrancerSpacey,Fun but Quill is more professional,"As a professional illustrator for my taste Quill has better tools which professionals need and more possibilities, like color manipulation (repainting the color of objects for example), layers and their management which is very important for me. As a painter and drawer I don't need 90% of the things Tilt Brush offers. 

Tilt Brush has nice effect brushes (seems to be the usp of tilt brush) and i like the way the shader engine works (drop shadows on objects which give a feel for volume, also lighting/shading on some brushes) but for my typical illustration work this isn't really necessary. Because it's not the effects who are important to make a work interessting. It's the concept and idea behind it and your own drawing and painting skills. Especially when you have seen those programmed effects a hundred times.

So for the price of 30$ I expected a bit more and I would have not bought Tilt brush if I had known this before. But for 15$ at the moment it's ok and I don't regret it. Perhaps future updates will bring better, more features and advanced tools. If you are a hobbyist and you like to play with effects, than it's a fun app and I think you won't regret it, too. Because besides the things I said, it's fun especially when they aren't important for you.

Quill vs. Tilt Brush is like Photoshop compared to MS Paint or Art Rage 4 (If you know this program.) But to be fair: At the moment both programs are more a field for easy going and fun experiementing and Quill needs improvements, too. When I have to paint for job, I use neither Quill nor Tilt because both won't do the job at the moment, so instead I use Photoshop.","Apr 12, 2017 at 4:21 AM",3, 10,
