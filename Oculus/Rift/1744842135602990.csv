There are no settings you can adjust and some videos start off playing completely distorted or with stuttering, glitching, and audio not syncing. Then play the same video with DeoVR and it plays perfectly and you can easily adjust things to your liking. Don't waste your time like I did and just go with DeoVR. I've tried about 10 VR video players (paid and free) and Deo is the only good one,.. and it's free! For some reason all the others just suck.",Nov 16 at 2:42 AM,1, 34,

This app uses head movements to control the interface via a small dot on the screen, you move your head and the dot moves - that's how you point!!  I'm sure that's how things were done years ago in VR but things have moved on.  Its impossible to use when lying down, because the video controls require you to look further down than is possible.

I did get a pretty awesome snowboarding video which made me want to dig out my snowboard and book a holiday; this was the only good video I saw.   I tried several others which claimed to be 8K but the picture quality was so abysmal that you could barely see what it was supposed to be.

Perfect for me and easy to use.

I found this, and you can watch them in any supported resolution and they look much better.

I also like this app because you can queue up videos or launch them from outside VR.  I use this when I'm showing family and friends VR so I don't have to explain to them how to find the video I want them to see.  The AirPano stuff looks incredible on here.","Aug 27, 2018 at 11:05 PM",5, 6,

The most comprehensive VR player I have seen so far is very promising. It is recommended to add more functions to the keyboard control, such as the control of the rotation, etc., come on! !","Aug 2, 2018 at 10:40 PM",5, 5,
