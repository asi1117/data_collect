 I have given this experience 3 stars based on it's FREE and the world realised is amazing, sadly it's another ""look what we could have done with the full game, moment, for me""

My Quick Thoughts:
Experiences like this make me so mad.... they show us the FULL potential of their game world in VR, but offer us just a slice and then proceed to tease us about the world. The amount of time they spent making this VR experience obviously shows there is no reason why the full game cannot be in VR. Decisions like this bogle my mind.
Again a very cool and atmospheric experience but a wasted potential.","Feb 27, 2019 at 1:34 AM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 18:23:16.408720,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Decent for a promotion.,This is a VR promotion for their 2d game. It has lots of video clips which introduces you to their unique and interesting game world. And that is it. No different than the KFC VR experience thing. It's an ad. It's free so whatever.,"Apr 9, 2019 at 1:46 PM",3, 0,
