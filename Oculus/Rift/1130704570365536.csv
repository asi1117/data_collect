2022-05-28 18:08:14.543885,Failend,Oculus stealing money,"This game was such a disappointment. First, the graphics wouldn't load all the way in the game so it looked like 2 bit graphics. It froze my computer so I asked for a refund and Oculus responded with ""You're denied"" No explanation or anything. $40 just wasted. They said I could download it again if i wanted to. FOR WHAT?! I didn't even play the game more than 10 minutes and they're denying my refund. Wonderful way to keep customers.","May 27, 2018 at 6:22 AM",1, 244,
2022-05-28 18:08:14.558845,Jacob-Mundy,Dont Download Cant get Refund,I love ark i have around 400hrs on the regular version but this was so bad i rage quit instead of shuting it off so i couldnt get a refund made me hate it even more super disappointing as if was just a complete cash grab.

2022-05-28 18:08:17.683488,Duncan_Disorderly,Disappointing,"This game should be amazing. Sadly, once the novelty wears off, you soon grow bored. Even sadder, the novelty value doesn't last very long. because there's not much to do and the existing tasks are boring. The game has a limited  amount of maps to explore and once you've seen them, you don't have any desire to return.  

Today (21/04/2018), I logged on my Oculus and noticed an update.  OMFG! Slowest download ever! Update is over 4Gig. I've barely download 1Gig and it's taken over 4 hours!!!  Ridiculous. I can't play any games on my Oculus ATM, because when I did earlier, it didn't pause the download and started from scratch when I finished playing my other game.","Apr 21, 2018 at 10:22 PM",2, 57,
2022-05-28 18:08:17.698448,blackeye634,Great graphics but ultimately boring,"(Only played single player so far)
This experience is almost like a series of cut scenes.
Scene 1, enter the park by shuttle - then a load screen for next area.
Scene 2, enter education centre - then load screen.
Scene 3, crafting area - again load screen. It continues in this vain through out the experience.
Lets start shuttle entrance - Reminiscent of the films Jurassic Park, looks great but its short and little more than a scene set piece. The education centre - Its interesting and nicely put together, graphics are excellent but it feels like its aimed at 5 to 7 year olds, children who were told not to let play VR because they're to young and their eye's are still developing etc - so why aim at this target group. 
Then there the crafting area. 
Ride a Dinosaur - again personally I think they're aiming at a target group who aren't supposed to use VR.
Crafting adds some replayability, but not a lot.
Exploration is probably the best part of the experience, the enviroment look and sounds great and so do the Dinosaurs but the areas are wat to small and once you've collected everything and scanned all the dinosaurs there is no real point to come back and this is what your really paying for. 
""Battles"" I'm sorry but this is so poor. A wave shooter that feels tacked on, like a last minute addition with the mechanics for aiming and reloading constantly going askew.
Ultimately it's just boring, I've brought apps that were a fraction of the price of this and frankly better. I imagine they put a lot of work into getting the look a feel right, which they achieved but they forgot to think about anything else. There's no game here! If it had been open world with large areas, freedom of movement and some loose story or reason to explore it beyond crafting it could have been so much better.
That said, I haven't looked at the multiplayer aspect of the game so will update if that offers more.","Mar 23, 2018 at 6:15 AM",3, 221,
2022-05-28 18:08:17.713408,bunnygum,"Good for 3 hours, then never touching","The best part about the game for me was the exploration which lasted like an hour.  After i completed all of that there was nothing left basically.  From what i imagined was that there was going to be a bunch of levels for the battles and a really fun crafting system and such, there was very little of that.  The only content left after that 2-3 hours of gameplay is just farming for things like eggs to hatch and materials to craft the very little amounts of weapons (no really, there is if i recall only 6 weapons a torch, a hatchet, and metal varients of the pick and hatchet).

This entire game is basically like a demo version of the game, but, it's not, this is supposed to be the full version and there is little content actually in the game.  My reccomendation is DON'T buy this, $45 CDN is not worth the price","Mar 23, 2018 at 10:16 PM",1, 108,
2022-05-28 18:08:17.727371,CryptoPaPa,not recommended,was really looking forward to seeing some really nice views looked like a nice game. sorry to say was cheaply built really bad graphics they just look fake. worth about topps $5 this is not a top game they really went cheap!,"Apr 18, 2018 at 4:17 AM",2, 36,
2022-05-28 18:08:17.743328,Tankshell,Game fails to launch! (UPDATE - fixed),"Can't even start the game, it crashes immediately. Checked my other games, all working fine. Will review again when they actually release a working version.

UPDATE - updated to latest Nvidia drivers 391.24 and restarted PC again, game now actually starts up. I suggest updating to latest drivers if anybody else encounters the same issue.","Mar 22, 2018 at 9:25 PM",3, 32,

My Thoughts:
Ok I'm a sucker for VR dinosaur games. I loved Robinson 'The Journey' and have played it 3 times now. On booting up Ark park I was expecting a generic wave based shooter. I was wrong. Ark Park features a mixture of different game styles, from crafting to exploring and even riding and rearing dinosaurs.
The game has a really cool intro and the tutorial is brilliant.
Graphics, textures and animations are superb and the game runs really smooth (default settings) on my GTX 1060. I had no performance issues.
I'm looking forward to jumping back in and finishing my Dino-adventures.","Mar 23, 2018 at 5:05 AM",3, 30,
