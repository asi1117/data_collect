2022-05-28 18:53:17.759776,PhillyzBluntz,Great educational experience,"I have all space vr programs and this was awesome, love the narrated documentary style experience. I don’t understand some people’s complaints, I mean if you want it to look really realistic, build a rocket and go into space, but likely your head would explode because well no man can build a ship to view this stuff and would likely fail and fall apart getting close to these objects,what do you expect? Play no man’s sky/everspace or elite dangerous if you want a game and interaction, be glad you are in a time where you can experience stuff like this, maybe you should go back in time and shovel horse crap for chicken eggs and only source of entertainment is watching plaque bodies be dumped on a meat wagon, for me it was more than enough and I’m picky. Great for kids too, instead of seeing videos and books in class they can experience space and it’s scale visually while learning. Can’t wait for more, good job.",Dec 27 at 3:03 PM,5, 1,"Thanks for your feedback: it made our day!

2022-05-28 18:53:17.789696,DermotOBrien,Amazing,This VR program provides amazing insight into distance in space and the incomprehensible vastness of this Universe we live in. It provides a wonderful visual model showing the eight planets revolving around the sun and gives you a fantastic sense of the relative size and speed each planet is traveling at.,Feb 1 at 2:44 AM,4, 0,Thanks for your feedback

2022-05-28 18:53:20.968195,Angelina Starr,Too short!,"EDIT:  Nov 2020 - No Change.  I'd say it has definitely been abandoned.  
This is an incredible view of the cosmos but too short for the money.

EDIT:  February 11th dev noted that more would be added in near future.  We're over two months later.....still no added content.  Abandoned?

I dropped my rating to three stars and will drop it a star for every month that new content isn't added.","Nov 15, 2020 at 12:21 AM",3, 9,"Hi Double_Shot, we're doing our best to bring quality content at a reasonable price. More content is coming, it just requires time to make. If you're wondering, this upcoming content is an exploration of the Milky Way, highlighting the black hole at the center of our galaxy, as well as nebulae and star clusters. It will be included for everyone and will not be a DLC. Thanks!"
2022-05-28 18:53:20.983155,DelapierceD,Epic,"You can see everything to scale in both size and distance (not usually feasible in physical space). You get to watch the Earth corkscrew around the Sun as it, too, shoots through space. You get to cross the Milky Way as a giant. Awesome","Jan 9, 2021 at 10:49 AM",5, 0,Thanks for your feedback!
2022-05-28 18:53:20.999112,ATeamAmerica,Absolutely Loved It,I really hope they make more. Seeing the scale of the solar system in VR was mind blowing. As it zoomed out further I was more and more impressed. Ear to ear smile for the whole thing. When it got to the super far out nebulas and galaxies the detail wasnt great but overall its amazing and i cant wait for more.,"Oct 29, 2020 at 6:03 AM",5, 3,Thanks: you gave us an ear to ear smile too :)

2022-05-28 18:53:24.110790,josh.mullis,"A ""stellar"" masterpiece!!","They have fixed the launch issues by the way. :)

This experience has changed my entire view of the cosmos and how we think of ourselves in regards to size.  This really puts into perspective how small we are, and how more than likely we are a part of something amazing at the ""cosmic web"" level.

For the devs:  Please release an update that allows zooming out at the cosmic web level.","Jun 10, 2020 at 2:38 AM",5, 6,Thanks for your support!
2022-05-28 18:53:24.125750,spandrel53,,"It's a pretty good experience. The unique aspect of this one is seeing the map of the known galaxies in The Beyond. There is little detail on the planets and their moons in our solar system, virtually none on the nebulas within our galaxy, no mention of the black hole at its center, nothing about the Andromeda galaxy. I think it's worth a few dollars if you have a kid or kids looking for an introduction to astronomy.","Jun 30, 2020 at 5:31 AM",4, 2,"Thanks, our next educational activity will cover exactly this: various nebulae of our galaxy the Milky Way, and the Sagittarius A* black hole at its center!

2022-05-28 18:53:27.264355,Wolvescream,,"Really, not much in it. All you get is a rather poorly made solar system, you get no informations on the planets, can´t zoom in much (Venus e.g. is but a yellow ball, when you move to close you just go through it. Every space map of the 20th century got more detailed planets. And you can´t do much with the program. Not even go into options menu to start another session. Got to quit and restart. Really, guys? Come on! And the graphic? What´s wrong with good resolution and nice graphic? It´s 2019!  Even Google Earth VR got a better image of the milkyway in the background.... and that´s not even their focus. No, i´ve seen way better programms. Don´t waste your money on this, it´s not... impressive.","Aug 13, 2019 at 6:03 PM",1, 11,"Hi there. 'Overview' uses data from NASA and other space agencies to locate every asteroid, planet and star with their correct position, movement and appearance in real time. It is one of the most accurate representation of our universe to date. Can you please confirm that your PC supports the minimum requirements for running the software? As for the options, you can use your Rift controllers to go back to the menu and shift between activities. Let us know if this helps."

2022-05-28 18:53:27.296270,Audacity,"Fantastic content, some visual artifacts","I'm a big fan of VR space apps, and I think I've tried most of them.  I enjoyed the content delivered here, and I'd recommend it to anyone who would enjoy a trip to a planetarium. 

An area where this experience could be improved is some of the animations.  While much of the experience is smooth (90fps), many objects moving through space seemed to be animated in a ""choppy"" way.  For example, some of the points of light (planets or stars, depending on ""zoom"" level) seemed to be orbiting their sun or passing by the viewer and it felt like they were being drawn at maybe 30fps with the rest of the environment was getting rendered at 90fps.","Dec 22, 2018 at 10:37 AM",4, 1,"Hi Audacity, glad you liked Overview. What was your favorite space experience in VR?

As for your feedback: thank you. The effect you mention may be related to different causes (software or hardware): could you share your PC settings with us at <support@orbitalviews.com>?

So my expectiations was big. The tours was great. But of course you really want to explore the Universe the same way you can on the PC with Oculus Rift.

Subsequently, Saturns Rings have dissapeared, when in shadow,  Moon orbits, still seem to interact with rings, but rings not seen.

Seriously?? This is the worst experience since DK1 early tryouts. Why is there this ugly VGA Bitmap background? Where are the individually placed catalogue stars known from SE? Then: Nobody uses ""Button A"" these Days when you have the Trigger on Touch controller. This says it all for me. Best case very early Alpha Version. Poor. Shame on you! Rip off","Jul 29, 2018 at 6:55 PM",1, 12,"Hi Godam,

Thank you for your feedback.

It seems you are looking for a different program. OVERVIEW is a narrative experience with some interactive parts. It does not aim at being an exhaustive simulation of our universe. 

As the developer of SpaceEngine pointed out, we are partners in this adventure and all sales from OVERVIEW contribute to the development of his application. 

The more you help us making OVERVIEW successful, the faster you will see SpaceEngine being rolled out. 

Hope this helps. Please do not hesitate to adjust your review or contact us directly at contact@orbitalviews.com

Best,
The Overview team"

Titans of Space was my first VR space experience so I'm a bit biased toward it. But despite a couple minor annoyances such as cutting out the sound between scenes and a few spots where the 3D doesn't merge correctly while zooming out, this is an amazing experience.","Jul 13, 2018 at 10:42 AM",4, 12,

Just about all I can do is use button B to turn off orbit trails. Not what I would call exploration. Frustrating, as I love Space Engine but if that's what this is based on there is no sign of it. No real star positions, just a static background. Could be so much better.","Jul 15, 2018 at 10:25 PM",2, 7,"Hi, it seems you're in the chapter that allows you to zoom in/out of the entire universe. 

If you want to explore the Solar System, you have to go to the activity ""Explore the Solar System"" where you can use the thumbstick to move around. Press A to zoom in when you are close to a planet, and you will be able to see it and its moons from up close.

If you're still facing trouble, please contact us.
If it helps, please let us know :)"
