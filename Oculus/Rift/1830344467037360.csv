2022-05-28 18:12:05.179019,Toploader,"Great content, but needs higher quality","The devs have said in a comment they considered releasing a higher quality version at 100gbs, which I’d be more than happy to download and view as the current quality is far too low to really enjoy. Or maybe break it up into chapters?

For people with VR gaming PC's, 100gb is smaller than many games these days... please give us the option.  

Either way it’s wonderfully produced and the content is great,, but the low quality ruins it to the point it’s borderline unwatchable, so they need to find a way to put out higher resolution clips. I’d happily pay for this.

As it stands, I'd not bother downloading this 20gigs worth of content.","Nov 4, 2019 at 3:12 AM",2, 10,

Yes, the image quality is about on par with older VHS, but can be helped somewhat by supersampling (1.2 on my gtx 1060 laptop with no performance impact).  The tour guide is excellent and the views are still impressive at its native resolution. Audio is excellent, spatially oriented too, which almost makes you feel as if you're there. I hope they produce some more of these.","Feb 1, 2019 at 11:32 AM",5, 3,"Spandrel 53,
Thanks so much for your great review! We worked hard to balance the size of the download with the image quality, but in the end, even this grainy stereo 360 weighs in at 20 gigs of download. We considered making this a fully uncompressed 100 gig download but that demands way too much room from all but the most beefy computers. We're glad you enjoyed your tour and we hope we get a chance to make another virtual tour. Where would you like to see us go next?

Thanks so much for your kind review! We're glad you enjoyed your virtual trip to Venice.

I really felt like I was there on a private tour and even felt like a celebrity at times as tourists and locals would look at the camera (me!) and I actually found myself so absorbed, I even unconsciously fixed my hair at one point and almost tried to talk to the tour guide! 

The gondola was the best but I wish it wouldn't cut but stay in one continual sequence.  Maybe the files are too big for one long sequence but I'm wondering if this would work streaming. The tour guide really seems to look you in the eye as he talks to the camera. As knowledgeable as he was, I often found myself distracted and enjoyed looking around, even at the tourists and locals which made it feel all the more realistic. I could have stayed on the gondola for ages! I would have liked to go inside the buildings though and see all the art, even go inside shops and venues. I would love a part 2. And other cities and countries like Greece. Hope there is more to come!","May 16, 2018 at 7:41 AM",4, 4,"Hi Alicia_Wonderland!

As other said, the video quality is poor and blurry, but this seems to be the trend with 360 videos due to inherent limitations. Besides, one response by the developer states the full resolution app would be 100+GB. Yeah, that would be a tough sell.

2022-05-28 18:12:17.771339,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Perhaps...,"...the closest I would get to visiting Venice. Professor Kenneth R. Bartlett was very knowledgable and talked in an engaging manner. I never felt bored. A minor issue is that the resolution of these headset-- and the video-- really limits the amount of immersion one could experience. Sometimes Bartlett would tell you to look at a particular detail on a building and making out that detail was difficult if not impossible. I know these are the early days of VR and these are the sacrifices. Hopefully as the technology matures, we get more of these type of travel/education VR videos in higher resolutions. I want to see more places, I hope they don't stop making them. I particularly enjoyed the videos that took place in the canal. They stabilized the camera footage so, although you felt like you were floating along, you didn't get sea sick. That was appreciated. I wished there was an extended cut along the canals, where one could just sit back for a time and soak it in.","Jan 30, 2018 at 12:17 AM",5, 5,"Hi cherfolie, Very happy to see that you enjoyed the experience! The footage on the Gondolas was stabilized pretty well, but the shots from the boat on the Grand Canal were the real surprise for us in how well they turned out! We were in a tiny little boat and the water was really choppy out there. A little behind the scenes info for you... underneath that yellow board that Professor Bartlett is sitting in front of on the boat are two people—our director of photography and our cameraperson. They had to crawl under the tarp for every shot on that boat and they spent almost 16 hours in a single day of photography on the Grand Canal. But it was worth it to hear you all say that you enjoyed the experiences!

Thanks for the good feedback. We're glad you enjoyed the content in our app. We chose to make the experience stereo 360 because we wanted to give the viewer the most immersive experience possible. We know there are trade-offs to this approach right now, particularly in resolution, but we felt that the ability to really look all around you and see the whole of Venice was important to the overall concept.

2022-05-28 18:12:17.802256,PoolfanVr,Venice,VR tourism is a medium that will grow and grow and this little freebie is a peek at how it can work.  Right now I think VR video is in its infancy and generally video quality ranges from half decent to terrible but even with this caveat this shows how it will work.  The videos are among the betters ones quality wise and are decent enough to give you a feeling of immersion because they have got the scaling right (and many VR videos do not). The commentary is interesting and informative and with the added VR experience it makes it worthwhile for anybody wanted to get a little flavour of what floating down the Grand Canal would be like.    Well worth a look.,"Feb 17, 2018 at 11:16 PM",4, 4,"Hi PoolfanVr,

Ha! I used to own a PXL-2000 :) We shot in Venice with a Nokia Ozo which, I believe, has a lens spacing of something like 85 or 86 mm.  It was really the only camera package on the market at the time that we could have used for this kind of shoot.

2022-05-28 18:12:24.092432,Kevin_Brook,Great step into VR for The Great Courses,"I should preface this review by saying I am a HUGE fanboy for The Great Courses. I own around 70 courses on DVD and have invested literally hundreds, maybe thousands of hours of my life into listening to their lectures. So to see this just pop up on the Oculus Store unannounced was a hugely welcome surprise. As expected the content is A+, Professor Bartlett is a very engaging and learned professor and gives an excellent tour of one of Europe'st most captivating cities. The VR aspects and the scene selection are all first rate. As others have said the video quality is not the best, but I think that's more a problem of first generation HMD technology, screen resolution, video bandwidth etc and will take time to overcome. As a free offering and an exciting promise of what the Great Courses, in partnership with the Smithsonian could do in future is very exciting. I own the Smithonians; Paleontology DVD from the Great Courses and I'm positively giddy about the prospect of them resurrecting prehistoric creatures and bringing them to my Oculus Rift, Please make this happen soon!","Jan 28, 2018 at 5:11 AM",5, 5,"Hi Kevin_Brook,

2022-05-28 18:12:27.224056,Cullinarn,MUST HAVE! This is what VR is for.,"This is a must have. And it is worth every GB of space. I am very glad someone finally did this. A tour of Venice seemed like a no-brainer to me. Both the videos and the lectures are very well done. The UI was clear, the routes through the various parts of the city were intuitive, and it was wonderful to get to see some things I did not have the chance to see when I was there.

One note on the video quality, since some have criticized it:
The quality of the video in this  is a great deal better than any other 360 video I've seen (I'm running with a 1080ti). And it is ACTUAL 360 video, rather than panoramic. That said, due to 1st gen HMD resolutions. as well as compression limitations, we're not going to completely ""feel like we're there"" for  a while yet, but this is as close as it comes at present. The dev seems to have done everything on their end to push the best video for the consumer product we currently have. The results ARE impressive, and I look forward to more. I think I saw a ""Great Courses"" logo in there somewhere. Hopefully that means that the company is looking into doing more of this. Once again: This is what VR is for. I've seen dozens of games where you shoot stuff, and, in the end, it all goes boom. I've only seen a couple of experiences like this, and this is the best one yet.","Jan 20, 2018 at 12:08 PM",5, 3,"Hi Cullinarn,

Thank you so much for your awesome review! We worked really hard to provide an experience that captured the feeling of being on a Smithsonian Journeys tour with an expert guide. It makes us really happy to see that you enjoyed it. 
The production was a joint effort between Smithsonian Journeys, The Great Courses, Total Cinema 360, Lucid Dream VR and a LOT of generous help from Oculus, whom we cannot possibly thank enough.
We were worried about the file sizes of the videos (I think it comes in at some 20 GB) but we were really laser-focused on providing a LOT of really interesting content for our audience. We're really happy with the video quality as well, especially for the run and gun conditions we were under - you can't exactly shut down the Piazza San Marco for two days in June. :) 

Thanks very much for your kind review!

2022-05-28 18:12:27.241011,little-maxima,They should have streamed the videos,"This is a good app but you have to download the videos which is why it takes up 21 GB of hard disk.
It would have been better if they streamed the videos, like 'Travel VR' app does. That app lets you travel Italy and isn't a 21GB download.

It's great to see Smithsonian come up with such wonderful content.","Jan 24, 2018 at 5:30 AM",3, 1,"Hi little-maxima,

Thanks for the review! It was a hard decision to make about streaming vs downloading. We did a lot of research into average internet speeds and, ultimately, we decided that downloading was better because it wouldn't make the experience dependent upon the viewer's connection speed. If we had made it streaming only it would mean that only people with GREAT connection speeds could enjoy the app. But, we also understand that 20 GB is a LOT of storage space. 6 of one, half dozen of the other, right?

Glad to see that you enjoyed the content!

Menu is helpful to understand geographically where everything is, maybe google maps or helicopter/drone flyover to make it more real.  Love the 3D audio and area mics to get a sense of the atmosphere.  Would also pay to see these and others in 6/8K/HDR across multiple cities and times of day.  Hoping for more to come!","Jan 23, 2018 at 3:51 PM",5, 2,"Hi thepurechill,
Glad to see you enjoyed your virtual tour of Venice. This is our first app and we're still learning the exciting world of VR filmmaking, but we're pretty proud of the experience. We considered getting a drone for this, but we've never put something as heavy as a professional 3D 360 camera onto a commercial drone and the Venetians would have been pretty annoyed at us if we had crashed an aircraft into the side of the Basilica San Marco. :) Maybe next time we can get a pro drone pilot on site and get some good aerial shots.

2022-05-28 18:12:27.272925,briancooper2,A free tour of Venice with a smart guy!,"what an amazing gift for free. I enjoyed this very much. Venice is my favorite city. However this tour showed me things I didn't know.  Best of all last time i was in venice i stumbled accross this little hidden sqaure I did not know its name and i adored it and wanted to go back on my next trip. Sure enough there it is on the tour!  Thank you so much Prof,Smithsonian, and the Rift for offering this. Where can i get a job shooting tours like this? I hope more are offered id happily pay for these. Additional note,  San Giacomo Di Rialto is the sqaure I was talking about.  As for other places  I would love to see a exploration of the Knights bridge in Edinburgh so many interesting things happened around the castle. and the hidden tunnels and stash places are facinating.  may the temples in Cambodia,  Maybe the fortresses on the Rhine. So many wonderful places. Truth is I'd watch them all, i love travel.","Jan 21, 2018 at 6:03 PM",4, 2,"Hi briancooper2,

Thanks so much for the kind words! Now we're curious to know which square it was? Don't leave us guessing! We'd love to offer more of these trips if this one is successful. Where do you think we should film next?

It's enjoyable, but sadly no real VR and the video quality is absurdly bad.

You get a really nice tour guide throughout the experience.  Unfortunately, the video quality is blurry and generally poor quality 360 videos.  And they are pretty short as well.
