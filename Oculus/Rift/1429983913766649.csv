2022-05-28 14:12:50.686611,Storvite,Read this before buying,"I purchased this game after hearing such great reviews from friends and I just wish that I had read the reviews earlier. I'm playing on a Rift S and as soon as you start up the game, you are greeted by a black screen and you cannot play the game. Extremely disappointed as I've just paid for nothing.

2022-05-28 14:13:00.101838,UhDweeb,Very fun,"Extremely fun game! The base game is around 2 hours of gameplay, however the levels have replayability value, and the bonus levels give you about another 30 minutes of gameplay. The devs have some pop-culture references in there, which I appreciate. Though its a fairly short game, it's still very fun. Also, why do people say its a ripoff of superhot? Just because a game has slo mo as a core mechanic doesn't make it a copy.","Jun 24, 2020 at 6:22 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:13:00.116798,Shane_nothing_VR,,this game is terrible. its a ripoff of superhot. the controls are horendous. it was a waste of my money,"Mar 30, 2020 at 7:18 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 14:13:00.131758,Shanaflan,Good fun,"I really enjoyed this game, it is good fun and at times a bit of a challeng. The levels are short but I like that as its a game you can jump in out of for a quick game.","May 2, 2019 at 4:58 AM",5, 26,
2022-05-28 14:13:00.147716,taquitobuddy,Brief fun,"This game has about 1-2 hours of content (closer to 1 unless you get stuck on the puzzles), but was only fun for about 30 minutes.  A couple of the stages (I tried them all) were frustrating rather than fun.  Can't really recommend it, maybe on a very good sale.  It isn't terrible, just so many better VR games.","Mar 8, 2019 at 1:41 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 14:13:00.162675,Spidermonkey8840,Bootleg Version of actual good games,"If you are considering buying this game and have not played games like Superhot VR and I expect you to die, I wouldn't recommend this game. The game takes all of the good parts of those games and makes it worse. If you already have played these games and are still considering, I still wouldn't recommend, because there is no more enjoyment you could get from this game that you couldn't get from the actual good games. The biggest issue I had was picking things up. This can be really frustrating, especially in this game when you need to be as fast and as accurate as possible. The game needs a system where as long as you are aimed at an object in a reasonable range, they can pick it up. Game needs a lot of work and provides nothing new worh buying.","Feb 14, 2019 at 9:11 AM",2, 8,

2022-05-28 14:13:06.428625,RScullion,Fun concept that grows old quickly,"Enjoyed it at first, but got a bit bored within 30 minutes. Some of the scenarios are fun but most aren't and most aren't all that challenging. Finished it in an hour including extra credits levels. Lot of money for that time.","Feb 24, 2018 at 11:30 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 14:13:06.443585,refugio507,I LOVED IT! It was fun and hilarious.,"I LOVED this game. It allows you to interact with most objects and it has a childish look just like Job Simulator does. Job Simulator is great for kids because the tasks are really easy to do and they tell you exactly how to do them. However, Just In Time Incorporated requires skill, and the ability to figure out how to complete certain tasks. Most tasks are parodies of popular films and I find all of them hilarious. I have played puzzle games like the Rick and Morty Simulator, Batman: Arkham VR, and I Expect You to Die. I must say that if you like this kind of puzzle games and you also enjoy Job Simulator you will LOVE this game.","Dec 29, 2017 at 12:16 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:13:06.458545,Slandaro,,"Love this game! Another in the style of games like elevator to the moon, job similator, rick and morty ect. Lots of things to play with many ways to accomplish your missions and just fun :) Would like to see a way to toggle the grab from trigger to grab button though hate using my trigger for grabbing things it just feels wrong. losing a star only for that","Dec 18, 2017 at 8:45 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:13:06.474502,Wigdogger,An entertaining way to spend 2+ hours,"Very charming presentation and a fun couple of hours of puzzle-solving and chaotic action. The puzzles vary from one- or two-step solutions to full blown Matrix-level bullet grabbing, but each level presents something unique.

I enjoyed the breezy music and goofy presentation, and there were a couple of fun surprises.

Totally worth it if you can get this one at a discount.","Jan 9, 2018 at 6:25 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 14:13:09.586782,cheesenachos12,Pretty Good,"It's a really unique idea.  I would have preferred funnier narration by a person, but somewhat-witty narration by a text to speech bot is alright I guess.  Graphics are meh, but I can understand how hard it would have been to make it better.  Maybe add a hint or two on some of the harder levels like the rat one.  Took me like five minutes before I checked the cabinet and found some daggers.  Also, maybe add some alternate options.  I would have loved being able to rip the driver out in the one with the old couple, and then have the car veer off of course and hit a tree.  Pretty good overall, though.","Dec 20, 2017 at 7:28 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 14:13:09.601742,DecimusInfinity,fun overall,2 hours and 20 minutes to finish everything(around 22 levels give or take) tho you could probably reduce that time if your aim is good and you're good about figuring out the scenarios. ROBORECALL 'point and aim' movement mechanics which I think are the best! No  replay value; meaning I havent noticed anything new during a replay of a level. Great graphics:EVERYTHINGS BLOCKS! Several pop culture references A+.  got it for 10 bucks,"Dec 18, 2017 at 11:14 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:13:09.617699,DatJashGuy,fun-ish,"bought it. played it. fun, but controls could be better","Jan 6, 2018 at 12:07 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:13:09.633656,Lobster_claw,Great concept,"unique game, good to show to friends with low motor skills, some missions are just not as fulfilling as they should be and alittle too easy","Jan 1, 2018 at 7:30 AM",4, 2,
