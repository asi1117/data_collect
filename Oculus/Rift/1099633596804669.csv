2022-05-28 18:05:11.593213,Tomatenmann,Great game with one major flaw,"REZ is a classic and the star of the game is undoubtedly the newely added Area X with its gorgeous visualization.

The problem with the 5 ""classic"" levels is that the objects are rendered at 60 FPS while the Rift is running the game at 90 FPS. This is causing some slight stuttering with all of the moving objects and enemies. 
It isn't a gamebreaking but for me quite distracting and disappointing. Area X is not affected by this, as it was build up from the ground for VR. 
I doubt it, but I still hope that there will be fix in the future.","Jul 21, 2018 at 5:51 PM",3, 20,
2022-05-28 18:05:11.610168,ADPGrommit,A VR step up,"I've played this game on two previous platforms.  That should make it clear that the game itself is good enough to keep it in your library, even when you upgrade to the new hardware generation.  Would that be enough to justify repurchasing it once again just to play in VR?  Normally the answer would be no.  A resolution upgrade is one thing, especially for those of us who have 8 bit origins, but a VR upgrade is typically lackluster and disappointing.  This upgrade won't blow your VR mind but there is something worth investigating.  I will admit my review is shaded by my initial experience of the game and the nostalgia that brings... but Arena X  changed my mind.  I honestly can't put my finger on what it was that changed my mind per se.  Playing the game in VR felt new again even though it wasn't revolutionary. There are moments in Area X where I .....
Frankly it was like talking to an old friend who had new stories to tell.  That being said I have to address my rating.  I will rate this one as a 4 officially for new players.  If you have played this game on other platforms I am sure you'll understand why the upgrade only gets 3.  That being said...  I'd buy it all day every day.  I would just temper my expectations going in.","Jul 19, 2018 at 10:53 AM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 18:05:11.626125,Ardyn_Allweiss,A whole new experience!,"The original Rez is already an awesome experience in music and synethesia, but the new Area X is simply beyond words! If you are a fan of the original Rez, you owe it to yourself to get this to experience it for yourself.

Please, need more Area X style content!","Jul 4, 2018 at 10:25 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:05:11.641085,WG1,Woah ! x 6,"(UPDATE - Targeting indicators are now plain white squares as if something is missing? What happened, kind of broke it for me, so distracting, makes me keep thinking, ""what is that?"") back to 4 starts until the targing indicators are fixed, thanks.)
Said WOAH ! at least 6 times, so giving this a 6 WOAH ! rating. (this was before they updated the targeting indicator that kind of broke it for me, PLEASE Fix)

Yes agree with WesleySnipers, area X expansions DLC would be great.

I also streamed my own music play list , but can still hear the sound FX mixed in, very cool atmosphere, great psychedelic stuff !

Tip : Alternate quickly between X and A fire buttons to save you repetitive motion.","Jul 27, 2018 at 6:57 PM",4, 3,

Playing the game is very intuitive: Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing, but it's fun! Flying around in this literally ""virtual"" reality, pointing at things that explode in a sea of fireworks.

2022-05-28 18:05:14.814597,h3liosphan,Incredible!,"Words can barely describe how incredible this title is - this game is utterly perfect for VR. It gives you that 'looking forward to the future' feel, of awe and delight! It's a stylised and abstract vision from the 90s (pre original Rez) like what we might've imagined of a VR future might be back then, even harking back further to the original TRON movie. 
It sure beats all your standard VR stationary/teleport shooting games (except maybe Robo-Recall). I've just come out of my first session (unfortunately it crashed or I'd still be in it!) having played both Rez and Rez X sections, and I'm blown away. I'm sure I don't stand alone when I say to the devs - MORE PLEASE! We'll all pay!","Jan 21, 2018 at 8:12 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 18:05:17.938242,DeShanz,Favourite game ever made even better,"Rez is an all time classic for me. The first game of it's kind to integrate visuals, sound, and tactile feedback into, IMHO, a masterpiece. This is how I felt for the first iteration of it on Dreamcast/PS2, which was made even better with RezHD on Xbox360/PS3. I've since moved on from consoles to PC gaming, where I've been gaming in 3D for years via Nvidia 3DVision hardware. It's been a long time dream to experience Rez in glorious 3D for so long that I thought that dream was lost, and almost forgotten, but then one day I log onto my PC and find Rez Infinite available for purchase in VR and was an instant buy. The launch was a bit rocky, due to bad 3D implementation, causing me to initially rate this 2 out of 5 (because I was literally that disappointed), but first they updated Area X, which was nice, but what I really wanted was to experience the main game that I love in 3D, and after some time the developers managed to implement the 3D strength option, which has finally made my dream come true. There are a couple of minor issues, like a slight skip in the music between stages, but other than that this is one of best experiences available today.","Nov 29, 2017 at 12:41 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:05:17.953203,Nij,,"I've always loved rez but to me this felt a little underwhelming compared to the games we have now.  The graphics and music surely could of had a revamp but they still look the same as previous versions and somehow if they could of implemented both touch controllers, instead of just one, this would of also added to the immersion and I found a lot of the time the target wasn't keeping up with my hand movements and I felt like I was aiming in completely the wrong direction and I've got 4 sensors and every other game, my tracking is perfect!

EDIT I realised the tracking isn't off, it's the fact that moving your hand and your controller both control the target which is frustrating as I want to move my head around but it interferes with me targeting, devs: please give an option to just either use your touch controller or head to move your target around and not both at the same time, would be much easier","Nov 21, 2017 at 8:18 AM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 18:05:17.968162,lph,Short but awesome,"I had never played rez before, but I often heard reviews being overwhelmingly positive about the game. After having played it, I totally understand why. Even though the game is short, it is a great VR experience. The music, the good pace and the cool art-style make this game immersive (even without hyperrealistic graphics.) The fact that it's short, shouldn't be a problem, you should compare it to a really good song that you want to hear over and over again. I am sure that I'll play through it multiple times.","Nov 13, 2017 at 3:47 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:05:17.983123,stefan.lovecchio,"area x is fantastic, but wayyy too short","the old rez on vr was cool enough, until i tried area x... now, in all honesty, its hard to play through the old levels, they pale in comparison. the new built-for-vr area x level is GORGEOUS, absolutely a must play. but unfortunately it's just one level, and not worth the price merely for that.

i really do hope that they make more levels. and also, i hope other vr developers take note of the success of rez vr and try it out themselves, so they can see how vr can open up experiences that transcend dated gaming genres. we should be trying new things that make sense for vr, not merely trying to recreate what has worked in 2d!","Oct 29, 2017 at 3:46 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:05:17.998082,HolkDiggity,Area X Is The Best Part,"So Rez is an old game, but there is an extra mode in this version called ""Area X"". It blows the original game out of the water. I played around with the main game for a bit, and its pretty good. Area X, though is phenomenal. Its unfortunate that it is so short, but I want to go back into it again because its so good.","Nov 16, 2017 at 12:06 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 18:05:21.146662,aG3nt_oRanGe,"Too dated, not good enough for VR.","I love Rez, having played it Sega Dreamcast back in the noughties. It was a great game, back then. This been adapted to VR without any thought about it. Having a 3rd person perspective kills the immersion straight away, and there is no option for 1st person.
The music is also dated, sounding very tinny and 90's. And the graphics have also not aged well.
Even with Touch support (you can only use one touch controller) the gameplay is very tedious, it is after all just a wave shooter on rails. When converting games like Battlezone to VR, the developers didn't do a straight port - they updated the game to fit the times. No such thought has gone into this. If you are curious best to wait until this is down to below £5, but you will still feel a little underwhelmed even at that price.","Aug 22, 2017 at 2:18 AM",2, 9,

2022-05-28 18:05:21.176581,Frogacuda,"A psychadelic masterpiece, then and now","Rez's combination of abstract, stylized visuals, melodic sound design, and rhytmic gameplay pacing are even more compelling in VR than they were on the Dreamcast back in 2001. It's always been the sort of game you have to give yourself over to, and VR makes it that much easier to lose yourself in the sights and sounds. 


This release also features a pretty important addition, a new level called Area X that is, in fact, much more than just an extra stage. It's essentially a mini-sequel that features modern graphics, a new engine, and free-roaming gameplay different from the original. This stage is beautiful, and after beating it for the first time, I found it genuinely overwhelming, in the best possible way. It wrecked me for a few minutes. I know that's not an experience that will happen for everyone and I'm sure it's not something I could replicate, but it was one of the best moments in gaming I've ever had. 

VR is already an inherently pretty psychadelic medium, essentially an artificial hallucination, but Rez uses that to define a world in which you can paint the sky with music, and this release proves it's a true masterpiece.","Aug 11, 2017 at 2:14 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:05:24.258338,Asane,5 Stars Just for Area X,"I cannot imagine having played Area X any other way.. The simplest way to describe my experience is that of experiencing nirvana in the purest essence of the word. By the end of Area X, I was legit crying my eyes out. 

It was a legit religious experience that I am so happy to have witnessed. For that moment where I was in Area X, I forgot I was standing inside my room and thought to myself this is what inner peace feels like. 

It was glorious!","Aug 11, 2017 at 10:50 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:05:24.273298,MarquisDeSang,Not as good as PSVR version(no 3D depth),"Problems reported on many forums : there is no stereoscopic effect in RezX both eyes are the same. PSVR had a full 3D effect like all VR games, but there is definitely a problem on the rift.

There is almost zero 3D effect, like everything is too far, so you feel like it's a 2D game projected into a 360 sphere. The PSVR version had much more colors and the 3D depth was fully there. So all the particles are now uninteresting because they are flat and far away. Many things are different, the soundfx don't sound the same and the game is a little bit slower and there are little hesitation into the music and the sounds. My pc performance has nothing to do with it, trust me. But the game is worth it anyway if far from the playstation VR version.","Aug 13, 2017 at 8:16 PM",1, 19,
2022-05-28 18:05:24.289256,kittsy,Almost perfect,"This is awesome. One of my favourite games of all time, I still listen to the original soundtrack and the Gamers Guide remixes on a regular basis. VR does sort of reduce the challenge from the normal levels, and it's a shame that it has to be restricted to 60 fps, but it's still amazing. The new level is just incredible, I want a whole game like that. The only thing that could possibly make this better would be support for the original USB Trance Vibrator (I have two of them from the PS2 version, the rumble in ordinary controllers doesn't compare). This is the fourth time I've bought this game over the years, please patch in some Trance Vibrator support for this version :-)","Aug 12, 2017 at 3:24 AM",5, 5,

Only slight problem is that it's a bit too easy now with Touch controllers compared to the old Sony PS2 dual sticks I used when it first came out.

That said, I personally found ‘Rez Infinite’ an absolute joy to play. The original game is still amazing, and is one of the best examples of how to combine graphics, music and gameplay to create a unique artistic experience. Area 5 is still one of the coolest final levels in any game. Apart from a couple of short segments with awkward camera angles, the VR version is undoubtedly the best way to play the game – the enhanced sense of scale is mindblowing, particularly during the layer transitions. The new ‘Area X’ level is also beautiful.
