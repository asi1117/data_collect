2022-05-28 20:21:21.899363,ClarkyTheSharky,A true VR gem!,"This is a truly great game.  Fascinating story that's told in a novel way.  Engaging gameplay.  Music that really helps set the mood.  Good visuals.  Map design that has interesting variation and unexpected verticality.  Intuitive controls that are clearly designed for VR.  And it's cross-buy for PC and Quest, which is an absolutely fantastic value.  This game is criminally underrated and overlooked.",Mar 20 at 12:11 AM,5, 2,

The music really helps me chill out while trying to figure out what I can and can’t do and how the game works.

2022-05-28 20:21:21.928286,TensileGerm,Excellent,"A beautiful world that's fun to be in with a lot of great atmosphere - excellent sound design.

A rewarding gameplay loop - you go out each day on an adventure and come back to your camp to reset for the next day (similar vibes to Valheim's loop).

There's something great about the primitive act of piling up sticks and building a campfire.",Feb 11 at 4:00 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:21:21.943245,siriusmark.925,You will love this game,"Prepare to stay alive. This is a beautiful game visually. The game play is you against the elements and creatures. You must keep awareness of your health, your hunger, the condition of your weapons (crude as they are), and your exaustion. Also your camp and fire, the only place you can save the game. Take advantage of the videos on YouTube because you must learn as you go. It is not easy to put it all together. You will find yourself away from camp with surprises from the elements and the realization that you cannot make it back to save the game before you die. BUT you have learned something. So you try again. Nighttime is not much fun but there are things that you can only do at night. As much as I have tried to plan my next venture I always get sidetracked and loose my purpose while pursueing another goal. My mistake!",Dec 29 at 4:56 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:21:21.958205,Fleshycannibal,This game is awesome!,"Immersive, beautiful (not realistic beautiful), and entertaining. Just make sure you save often... The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because twice now, I have lost an hour or so of progress due to the game crashing while saving.",Jan 31 at 4:10 PM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:21:25.078461,MrSenseiSean,Review changed after update,"5 stars as the developers took our reviews into consideration, and turned down the hunger intervals. Apparently the indicators can be turned off now, which seemed to distract and bother me before, causing me to think i constantly needed more sustenance. 

Thank you guys for making such an awesome game. Best and favorite VR release in awhile now!",Dec 2 at 3:10 AM,5, 3,Very happy to hear this! And so glad we could address the issues you ran into. Thanks for the great review and please get in touch via Discord with any other feedback you might have!

2022-05-28 20:21:25.108887,corprinus,You should get this game,"I gave this game a bad review from the start due to it's difficulty, but it's actually very playable and very good. The hardest part is getting to the second campfire, but once you do, this game rocks! Controls are solid and intuitive, I haven't encountered any bugs, and the graphics look great and run smoothly on minimum VR requirements from years ago. This game doesn't need a story...you are discovering the game and the enviroment, flora and fauna and that's what makes it shine. When compared to A Township Tale, this game is single-player and let's you discover things on your own without having other players or look up stuff online. If you are looking for a great open world style survival game, this is the best I've seen on Oculus.",Oct 9 at 8:55 PM,5, 29,
2022-05-28 20:21:25.123847,Amazing74,"Good game, mediocre graphics","I like the game in general, but why is the no setting to adjust / improve the graphics? Come on guys, this is pc vr.
Obsolete: The last patch added some scaling options for the graphics on pc - thanks to the developers. +1 Star.",Dec 6 at 12:30 AM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:21:25.138807,cutyourtoast69,Overhyped,"After putting some time into this game, ive decided i dont like it. Good job to the devs for making their game and everything, but i decided i dont enjoy iy. I cant quite put my finger on why this is... But if you enjoy a crafting focused title, go for it. I was experiencing motion sickness after playing for 30min+ game sessions, which i dont get in other games. Checkpoints a scarce and you could lose upto 30mins progress if you arent careful. I CAN however see the hype behind the game, but its not for me",Dec 1 at 6:28 AM,2, 1,"Thanks for checking out our game, and for the review. Sorry to hear you didn't enjoy it. Motion sickness can definitely ruin a VR experience, and we were very focused on providing different options (and tweaking them to be as comfy as possible). Were you able to check out the teleport option for traversal?

I'll write more of a review down the line but I really can't recommend this game enough! Amazing. Beautiful. Engaging VR. ( I only wish it was on Steam though / at least I can install on PC oculus side i guess )",Oct 9 at 5:26 PM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:21:28.245120,RuneSR2,"Not proper PCVR, but still a great game","EDIT: after seeing how incredibly much better the PCVR version is compared to both Quest and PSVR I'm increasing my score to 5 stars. Also the game greatly improves after mastering a rather steep learning curve. Thus be patient and don't judge the game before you've killed the first animals using your bow.

My original review still stands:

Feels like an enhanced PSVR port, not much for the RTX 3090 to chew on, lol. 
No graphics settings available at all! Really annoying gameplay constantly lacking food (like Seeking Dawn). Can only save at certain places, if you die you may have to replay an entire and large level - this can be very frustrating.
Low poly assets, but large view distance. Limited shadows, but in direct sunlight animals do have nice dynamic shadows. Would have loved better shadows on the vegetation. Some textures do look great, but most are low-res and cleverly hidden behind the cell-shaded graphics. I was greatly looking forward to this game, unfortunately I have not been as impressed as I hoped to be - but it's not a bad game, and I'm not going to refund it - the sum of great stuff does exceed the sum of frustrating parts. The game does create an immersive and unique world, especially later levels. My ratings:

Textures = 6/10

Lighting = 8/10

Polygon levels = 7/10

Sound = 7/10

Controls = 5/10

Content/gameplay = 9/10

Using lcd it's extremely hard to see anything (including predatos) at night, but everything changes with oled, where you can see almost everything - like getting true night vision, lol. Clearly this game was designed for PlayStation oled hmds. There are no dynamic shadows on hands or held objects, clearly this is not proper PCVR quality. Also you only got hands like in Alyx, would have been nice with arms and a body for immersion. Really sad that devs cut this game down for low-end hardware. Stormland looks like 10 times better. Compared to real PCVR games, games with low-end graphics like this game should not cost more than $20. Owners of old rigs with a GTX 970 might love this game though ;-) Many Oculus exclusive PCVR games released in 2016-2017 are still far ahead of this game, and that really says a lot (no, we don't have to mention Lone Echo, just take Wilson's Heart and Mage's Tale instead). 

Tested with Asus Strix OC RTX 3090, i9 10900K and 32GB 3200Mhz ram. Works perfectly with Revive - I get solid 90 fps using Index and SteamVR res 400% (yes, four hundred, I did not type that wrong - this is due to the game being cut down for PSVR and Quest). And Rift CV1 works in solid 90 fps using ss 2.5 (that's 27 mill pixels per frame for both eyes).",Oct 12 at 3:18 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:21:28.278032,themerote,Tough but fun,"What can I say its fun, graphic art style is more translatable on PC than on Quest 2 but if you don't have a gaming PC its still pretty decent on Quest 2 but given the choice PC is better. I don't understand why alot of cross bydon't have cloud saving, it's pointless having on both. The game feels a little like breath of the wild with the art style but way more crafting, the giant crows are super creepy and there is some decent combat, I'm not too far in and hope it doesnt get repetative so it gets 5 stars for the first couple of hours of play, I have to restart from scratch on PC unfortunately cox not Cloud saves.",Oct 11 at 10:29 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:21:28.295984,HonlyGaming YT,Simply the BEST Survival game in VR,"After a long period of small VR experiences and a pretty dead period for the VR community, we are finally getting some amazing titles.
Song In The Smoke is easily one of my favorite VR games of all time even though I don't really love survival games.
I must say that in VR any games are way more enjoyable but the guys at 17 Bit studios managed to bring a really immersive and creepy survival experience.
I love the graphic style and especially the crafting system is deep yet simple and pushes you on discovering more and more receipts and tools to craft.
The overall look of the games is gorgeous and during the night you really feel in danger and honestly, I never felt safe even at my campfire. 
Song In The Smoke does perfectly what a Survival game should do! It's easily recommended to anyone that has an Oculus Headset.
Good job 17-Bit studio and thanks for this amazing title!

2022-05-28 20:21:28.311941,signmaker11,My idea of a perfect VR game,"I usually end up returning most VR games before I hit the two hour mark. This is one I potentially plan on keeping. The crafting feels great once you start doing a lot of it. The world is amazing. Being chased in the darkness by a giant bird creature felt very realistic and absolutely terrifying. This is my idea of a perfect VR game. If this had multiplayer, I'd put it in my top 5 games of all time. If you enjoy survival games, get this!",Oct 19 at 2:54 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:21:31.412777,Avaruusdonitsi,Ok at best,"game seems quite intresting but awul gamedesign choises ruin the game.

you need to open inventory everytime when you want to use something (NO HOLSTERS).

No jumnpig, falling or climbing only teleport. That really destroys the immersion.

This is not how you make VR game. I think that the devs have put too much effort to make it work playstation and it usually makes the game horrible to play in proper vr platforms (PSVR is good but contollers are horrible)",Oct 11 at 4:19 AM,2, 2,"Thanks for playing our game and providing this feedback, we really appreciate it. There were multiple reasons that led to this implementation of climbing, and it would be very difficult to change (especially since it would cause a marked change between the behaviors of players using teleport movement style, versus free movement mode). The movement speed and fatigue values have been tuned between these two play styles, and changing clambering would impact that balance. Plus, it would require a rework of every piece of collision in the game. :-/ As it is, you are an athletic caveman who can jump over chasms. :)

Regarding holsters—have you figured out how to use the quick access slots? Basically you add an item to those and you take out your weapons with a single button press (no inventory opening required). For more detail, please join our Discord and we can fill you in: https://discord.gg/tUEaYJdV"

2022-05-28 20:21:31.443695,Masamune5454,game be bananas. feedback/ bugs,"UPDATE for bugs: game itself is amazing and i hope it gets a content update with more weapons and buildings. theres actually alot to this game and its super fun killing a tough animal youve been stalking or running from the night and its.... things to get your food back to eat and prep. its a very satisfying gameplay loop, but there def need to be more content added. maybe im dumb and just dont know , but as of now its feels a little limited. no the second map indroduced new material, so things get upgraded, but i dont know if any new things are found.
bugs/
so the teeth disappear when the bow breaks, which they should fall off like the club, speaking of is there no other weapons or buildings? no spear, or spear and knife throwing. no axe? 
also clothing pops off and its stats reset if it breaks during sleep or harvesting.  
why in the world is the storage thing limited to one per slot? also did oculus not get updated yet?

original review
much luv devs. also after playing some more, this is a cool survival game. i hope its deeper than i think, like i hope there more than 3 buildings, and better weapons ect. but as of the first level its pretty dope. i mean the tutorial was long so im assuming im just scratching the surface. i do wish some things were done different, but building campfires ect is pretty cool, and they take a different appraoch to survival, like farcry primal is what it felt like it was going for. im not sure what the other reviewers meant, theres alot of food and its a legit wurvival game, meaning temp and hunger, fatigue and poison, even stealth for hunting. i wish there was hand tracking and some polish features, but thats about it. it def wowed me so i just hope theres more to do. also the levels confused me, as i was expecting open world, but maybe the camp sack keeps all your stuff in the new world? all in all i think its great, and pretty immersive.",Oct 15 at 8:16 PM,5, 0,
