Back then a lot of games got a pass because being in VR was just cool to begin with. Give me a reason to be there, no matter how shallow, and that was a win for me. But it's almost 2019 now, consumer VR isn't on the distant horizon and we aren't hurting for game options. So this massive step backward to controlling everything with my gaze seems like the wrong move to make. 

I have played the first world through and started on the second. I can see that as the game progresses there will be new types of obstacles and hidden pathways and that sort of thing, but when the main game mechanic isn't fun, none of that really matters. This feels like an early Gear VR game rather than a Rift game. Even the menus are navigated with your gaze, which is espectially unnecessary on Rift. 

You can reset your view and enter a free-look mode with the Touch controllers, but that seems to be it. Even that is weirdly implemented though because to do either you have to press and hold the button, which makes a graphic appear in front of you, blinding you until the timer is completed. Since you don't seem to do anything else with the controllers, I don't understand why there is a timer at all. Just make it instant. 

The game looks alright. Again, on Gear VR it would look nice, but on Rift it's not going to blow anyone away. Unfortunately, as with any gaze controlled game I've ever played, it doesn't matter because you aren't free to look around and enjoy it. You have a narrow path that you have to be on and, unless you hold the A button for a few seconds and enter free-look mode, you can't look around without the D20 thing you are controlling following you. 

I feel like my score might be able to go up to 3 if instead of using my gaze to steer the ball, I could use the touch controllers. But I can't imagine that it would ever go higher than that. 

I can't imagine that many people will be happy with this purchase.","Dec 5, 2018 at 7:46 AM",2, 15,

It is a game you can finish without timer or limited lives. But for the time trial you must practice and practice, and it is possible to get real good.","Dec 15, 2018 at 2:46 AM",4, 2,

My Quick Thoughts:
A superb concept in VR that gave me some really cool Marble Madness type vibes.
Controlling your futuristic ball using just your gaze is new and refreshing.
I have given the game 4 out of 5 but would have given it a 5 out of 5 had it featured a lot more replayability. For example I cannot see the purpose of playing level 1 again as there is only 1 crystal and no real challenge?
However I really would love to see modifiers added to the game. These modifiers could allow the player to change gravity, get rid of the side barriers, add wind turbulence, that sort of thing. They would add a lot more variety and challenges to the levels.
Imagine playing level 1 again but this time you had a strong gust of wind randomly effecting the ball forcing you to gain better control.
During my 1st impressions I never felt any sense of panic or dread in losing my ball as I was constantly in full control at all times, no matter the steepness of the slopes.
I really hope the developer can look into adding such bonus features as modifiers becuase this game deserves it. 
See my video above to see what I mean when I tried out the first 5 levels.","Dec 5, 2018 at 1:01 AM",4, 6,
