2022-05-28 16:02:03.531081,RuneSR2,Awesome movie - highly recommended!,"Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics, you easily need a fast gpu to use the high settings and high levels of super sampling.",Jul 18 at 5:23 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:02:03.546041,twistedWELL,Poignant,"I really enjoy this even though it's sad. I think the stylistic choices are very interesting. It's part sad it just doesn't work for some people in the comments, and isn't for everybody- but for me it always worked and I've loved it for a long time and enjoy sharing it with friends who like that sort of thing. It's pretty cool to see an 'anime' like style in VR and the writing is alright. :)","Dec 27, 2020 at 9:52 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:02:03.560004,krisvdvijver,A truly magnificent VR movie,"This is handsdown the best VR movie I've seen since early 2016 until today.  The concept is simple but perfect :  6DOF,  snap turn for seated viewers (which also gives the ability to choose the camera direction) and smooth and slow camera movement to make it more immersive/dynamic. Visuals are done in beautiful low-poly graphics and wonderful colors.  All this combined with a great and emotional story accompanied with excellent voice acting and beautiful music.  I wonder why there aren't many more animated VR movies like this... I would love to see a full-blown 90 minutes movie  like this.  Looking forward to the next chapter!","Oct 1, 2020 at 4:09 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:02:03.573966,martynasx88,Meh,Very poor performance app. Story is not that great.,"May 28, 2019 at 2:48 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:02:03.589924,LegoKnockingShop,Story not worth all the issues,"Taken me months and multiple attempts to finally get a workaround working - I imagine I've spent more time addressing this issue than the devs have as it's STILL broken many updates later. Monitor off didn't work for me, made it worse. Sort it out Devs for goodness sake.

Within the 'cinematic' mode and 'Dollhouse' mode the POV 'camera' never stops moving for long periods and is quite discomforting, and the scale is all over the place from scene to scene. Animation is approx 12fps while the environment runs at 90fps - if it's a stylistic choice it didn't add anything for me except make it look amateurish tbh. Character design is a mixed bag. The VO scientist guy is terrible, other voices just average. It's a dull story told painfully slowly and very, very p/reachily, repeatedly hitting you over the head with it's eco message. Dollhouse mode is cute but just another scale change which is barely any effort to implement. Just lacking in content or interest from my POV. Very dissapointed, even though I wasn't expecting much in the first place...","Mar 20, 2018 at 12:07 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:02:06.727532,Torackk,Poor script-writing ruins potential.,"Graphics: -  Simple...
Sonics/Voice: -  Great...
Gameplay: -  N/A...
Interaction: -  Poor...
Storyline: -   Poor...

{Spoiler Warning} As a VR movie, I found the writing to be incredibly poor. The setting of a dystopian wasteland future was pretty awesome but hardly unique. I understood the struggle of the characters but found it hard to connect with them, as they consistently acted outside of their nature. As such, their motivations were a mystery and there were multiple holes in the plot.

Having said that, the voice acting is skillful and accurate and the location and art-style, while being simple, is quite beautiful. A lot of effort went into making this world, it’s just a shame the writers didn’t do it justice.","Feb 22, 2018 at 11:11 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:02:06.741494,Chris052675,Disappointment,"Like the title says, it was a disappointment. I am not even referring to the content, but the inability to play. It locks the whole Oculus system up to maybe 2fps where I need to remove the headset and manually quit the program. This is the first of many apps I got with the Oculus and this is the only one that doesnt seem compatable with the system. If they ever patch this to work, I will come back to edit this review, but I wont hold my breath.","Feb 19, 2018 at 8:31 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 16:02:06.756455,VR_and_I,Broken (Feb 2018),"Yes, I know ther is an alt-enter/alt-space/switch off monitor workaround, however when I buy a product, even on sale, I expect it to launch from Oculus home without any jiggerypokery.
I will review it properly when it launches properly, untill then I will not run it.","Feb 8, 2018 at 3:36 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 16:02:06.771414,TheCrazyJack,Great when it works,"Sadly I experienced massive lag the first few times when I tried the application, this was fixed by turning off the monitor and using the alt+enter shortcut, which I would have never figured out without other guys in here that had the same problem, this needs to be fixed.

The experience itself is absolutely amazing, it is a proper shortfilm that utilizies VR for some amazing scenery, a cool relevant story and great music, I got it for 50% of it's original price which is well worth it, the experience is not that long but what you get is very good. 

5/5 without the lag, even for 5$ in my opinion, but that problem needs to be fixed","Feb 6, 2018 at 12:43 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:02:06.786374,Aquavemo,"Great story, broken app","I had to press alt+enter to get it to work. Thank you Yoan6911 for that suggestion. Developers please fix this! Otherwise I liked it a lot - story, characters and visuals are all well done. The different play modes are adding a nice replay value to it. (Wish this would be more common.) Want to see more of this!","Jan 27, 2018 at 9:04 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:02:09.919993,Bericdon,,"Yes - with ENTER + SPACE this works now. Thanks for the  help, too.            
Great atmosphere, artstyle, music and sound. The idea behind Melita is also great. Worth to buy and a favour to yourself to enoy.","Feb 5, 2018 at 6:33 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:02:09.934953,FastLawyer,One of the best VR cinematic experiences,"Honestly, I would only rate Miyubi and Pearl better than this experience.  I think this is on par with Son of Jaguar or Dispatch.   I thought Melita did start off a little preachy (but see the National Geographic hungry polar bear video and then tell me it's not needed), but it soon got into the story.  And it's a very well written story.  I especially liked the ""Dollhouse"" mode viewpoint on the action.  You really get to see the vastness of the VR world surrounding the plot in this mode.  It is a ""to be continued"" so it does end on a  semi-cliffhanger.  I don't even think the global-warming scenario effect on the north pole was the main plot, I think the central question of the plot is what is it to be human.","Dec 10, 2017 at 2:49 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:02:09.948916,nurocept,Can't get it to run,"I've got a decent VR rig and I can't get this started. I am using the dash 2.0 beta build so that could possibly be a cause but don't see why as when the app runs oculus should stand asside, which it does. The app hangs my PC and I have to kill it off via task manager. Will give this a try again soon to see if this has been addressed and will change my review/ratings then.","Dec 24, 2017 at 6:15 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:02:09.963876,FriendCalledFive,"A well crafted VR story, worth the price","I just tried it and enjoyed it, for the price it is worth picking up. It is the first of 3 episodes and I think is more aimed at a young audience with a strong eco message that is laid on thick, but even as an older gamer I enjoyed it. Soi far I only experienced the cinematic mode that took maybe 30 mins.","Oct 27, 2017 at 2:39 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 16:02:09.977838,Yoan6911,Nice vr experience but...,"It was a nice story. A little short thought. And at first it didnt work. For those who also have this issue of lagging even with a good rig, just turn off your pc monitor, or, use alt+enter and then minimise the mirror display at minimum.","Jan 15, 2018 at 12:02 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 16:02:13.083532,ronnyrydgren,Awesome!,Really really nice! The characters and animals had to low fps though only reason why i gave it a 4. I really want the next part! even if the character animation had stuttering frames per second that were to low it was a awesoem experience. Get me next part :D,"Dec 11, 2017 at 12:45 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:02:13.098492,sinoth,Great style and a promising future,"I agree with the reviews saying the story is a bit preachy. I lean environmentalist and still found the theme to be heavy handed. However, the style and presentation more than made up for it, and the current epilogue shows promise.

It's a great $5 experience. Honestly closer to 4 stars, but the low price bumped it up to 5 for me.","Oct 28, 2017 at 7:23 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:02:13.113452,skyestevenson,Excellent use of the medium,"Clearly draws influence from the likes of Steven Universe, Broken Age, and other animated series / games. The animation and the way they handled the art direction and cinematography of the whole thing felt perfectly suited for VR - giving you a linear story (the first episode of three, I believe?) in an immersive format that brings a real sense of presence while managing to still have a director's touch to it. The writing is anything but subtle, and harkens to sentimental scenes in aforementioned media, and can be compared to high school poetry. It's a little on the nose, but that's also its best trait. If anything, this is a story that the creators clearly believe in genuinely, and it shows.

All in all, I recommend picking this up if you love story based games/experiences. It's kinda short, but for $5 I think it was definitely worth it, especially since I want to see more from the developers (after all this is just the first episode anyway).

Cinematic VR is the place to be!","Oct 27, 2017 at 6:24 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:02:13.128412,anarcho520,,"Underwhelming, visuals nothing special (dull even), slow pace, preachy and predictable. There's better free experiences, this isn't worth paying for.","Nov 1, 2017 at 7:40 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 16:02:13.142375,Studio_Geppetto,,"Got a technical problem multiple times (when pausing and resuming, the voices disapeared). Though the story is ok, and some camera movements issues also, the all movie is enjoyable. It's nice to see this kind of contents!","Oct 30, 2017 at 6:14 PM",4, 0,
