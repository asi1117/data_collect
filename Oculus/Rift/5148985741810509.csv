If there isn't a way to use the thumbstick to walk instead of teleport, then I would reccomend adding that to this game. Other than that, cheap price for an awesome game!",Dec 19 at 10:29 AM,5, 2,

You get  incredibly realistic physics, a great workout, and the opportunity to practice shooting without leaving your home. You'll easily work up a sweat within the first couple minutes of playing.  According the move app I burned over 300 calories playing this game alone today.  This game is an asset.",Nov 14 at 9:29 AM,5, 5,
