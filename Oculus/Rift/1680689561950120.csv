But Overall, Great Game!","This is like a dream come true for me and it is actually a really fun game to play all around, but there is one tiny problem in which I can't really come to pass. The thing is, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate... I'm kinda too short for the full immersion. Can you maybe add a better height adjustment system to the game? That would help me out and it would make things so much easier. Thx <3",Oct 30 at 10:57 PM,4, 2,

2022-05-28 19:14:13.527049,jakiro,am i making it extra hard??,"the game is great and i love it but maybe, just maybe im playing the game in extra hard mode?? because i decided to not use my bow & arrow, and to not kill, if i can go throgh without killing and only using stealth and climping while stealing  kyes from the guards, but hay its a stealth game you know, not killing and using bow%arrow game, so am i doing great ? dont know but im trying to get the best of it. 
so far from the tutorial and level 1: 
kills count = 3 
death count = 5 
arrow used : 
blue = 1
red=0
yellow = 1 
based on that im doing great and having a lot of fun, the only problem is that my back is going to kill me tomorrow :)
-------
i dont know if the game is made with following points as part of it or not, but these are things i thought it could be changed in the game:
- guards AI: the gaurd AI can be left as it is if the game had easy diffuculty because it is really easy to go around them if they are not moving and there is a dark spot near them, you can even stand in the dark right in front of them and even wave your hand in their face and they will have 0 reaction about it, but if there were higher difficulty in the game it need some changes. 
- head positining: the game head tracking affect the player position and tracking, and example is if you are standing near an edge and moved your head to see around the corner or under you, the game will track it as if you moved and will make you fall over the edge so it can be really risky to be near the edge, another thing is if your are close to a light sorce and still in the dark and moved your head even if it was just a little to look around or look up the light senser will react to it and the garuds will notice that movment, i even tried to get as much as passible in the light while keeping my head in the dark while a gaurd was near me, the thing is if the head still in the dark even of most of the body is in the light they will not notice you and the senser will not react to it. thank you for a great game","Jun 9, 2019 at 10:21 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:14:13.542008,lord-sinon,other reviews are funny,i quite like this game and i think its funny that people who rank it bad seem to misunderstand that the game is in early acces meaning that is still being worked on so people expect a lot more than what they should and i look forward to see the game develop more,"May 20, 2019 at 5:14 AM",5, 6,
