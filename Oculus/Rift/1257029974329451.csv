2022-05-28 16:02:19.417590,ChewyThaPug,Terrible Menus,"Rec Room's new menu system is slow, tedious, and annoying to use. For some reason they made everything a scrolling menu, these are horrible to use on both VR and screen. Especially with their new maker pen menus. Nothing is colour coded anymore, and nothing is ordered chronologically. On top of this there are countless bugs and problems with the new menus that make Rec Room's menus the worst I have ever used.",Mar 9 at 10:00 AM,1, 25,
2022-05-28 16:02:22.554201,forclaz,"Lots of fun, but lots to be desired","Positive: Large community, servers generally reliable, runs ok, paintball is great fun

Negative: 

Many large updates! Latest update is 756MB to make sliders ""less jittery"" and other ""whimsical"" updates - really? I live in the country and have to download these over 5Mbps DSL - it takes 20 minutes - frequent large updates are very burdensome!

Paintball lacks any match making - Elite players are mixed in with newbies - makes for a bad first impression if a new player wants to try Paintball and gets matched to a player with over 100K hits. 

Menus do not respect basic user interface design best practices - for example, if you have a menu open on your watch at the end of a Paintball game and a new game starts, your menu is just forced closed, black RecRoom screen, then you appear in a new room. Well, you have to re-open your watch and quickly change a setting before the game starts - not at all ergonomic!

Teleporters in paintball - Some elite players use Teleporting as a way to gain a large advantage over non-teleporting players. Teleporters like that can be infuriating in a very competitive game - often one elite teleporter can join and cause many players on the server to rage quit.",Mar 23 at 8:54 PM,3, 6,

2022-05-28 16:02:22.583124,ThornyBlades,A few years experience,"so its been maybe a few years, I wish to give my opinion on this game. The community is nice sometimes, sometimes they're funny, or sometimes they're rude. The community made games can get boring, but they also give you a selection of rec room originals. The updates improve the game so much, and they focus where it counts, like the latest update where we can finally open doors with donuts in our hands.

2022-05-28 16:02:32.049804,iloutdoorsman,Was a good game. 2 years ago,Ok so i'm updateing my review from about 2 years ago so i try to play this game sometimes but i end up quiting for months until i can actually play because this game kicks you out at random times and it crases a lot and the loading screen never goes away so i dont load in but i woke up wanting to try rec room again and it was uninstalled and i cant reinstall it. so not a good game anymore but i have to install it on steam to play it because i cant install it so :/ and you know in-game currency right well recrooms currency is tokens but you cant grind for tokens anymore so you have to buy them but still you can still play it but people judge you based on ur looks because the toxic community. so recapping this it was good 2 years ago you cant get tokens you cant install it (i cant at least) and the community sucks so 2 stars recroom fix ur game and ill play it again,Dec 12 at 7:41 AM,2, 14,

2022-05-28 16:02:32.093686,I-Vough,This game has turned into something else,"Hi there, I'm a player from 2018. I've been dreading to write a review on this game for a long time, entered every single area of the community, from a creator to an elite cyber criminal, I've seen everything this game has to show. This is going to be a long one so here I go

When I first started playing, the game was genuinely fun, the community was loving, accepting and welcoming. I played every time I got home from school and enjoyed it very much, then I went into the Instagram part of the community in early 2019, all was good. I enjoyed looking at other peoples achievements, their friends, etc. However as time passed, things slowly got ugly.

People started fighting eachother, Rec Centers became more as an 'arguing club' rather than a lobby, I got used to the constant bickering players had to say when they saw my outfit with something rediculous to rant about like a necklace. Also the developers of the game became much more uncaring, false bans started going out for no reason, the overall quality of the game got worse, especially performance, good luck getting an average 60fps with SteamVR.

Around when 2020 started I lost all hope for this game, The horrors I saw from the community on Instagram, I feel so bad for the tons of people ruined by this game, I've watched good friends become terrible people, I've seen people I used to know quit the game after experiencing hell, I refuse to say what I have saw, but this game's community is honest of god disgusting. The devs no longer care,  the community just wants to make fun of other people for their own entertainment, the optimisation genuinely sucks, I've watched this game burn to the ground.

Please do not start playing this game, don't before it will be too late and you are completely brainwashed.",Dec 17 at 10:59 PM,1, 19,

""Friendly community"" Rec Room says. This is a friendly community? Honestly disappointed. One more thing, I'm honestly disappointed in the reporting system. I've never been banned before, but I've seen people get banned for the dumbest reasons. They weren't even good reasons too; and, it's just about mostly the toxic 9 year olds that fake their age as a 13 y/o to bypass being a junior account. I'm disgusted. But overall, great game! The community really needs a fix to it.

2022-05-28 16:03:09.969382,Roy.Crawford,Lots of fun!,"Most fun i've had in quite a while. This game is an incredible social platform - game mix that is pretty awesome. From my experience the community is REALLY nice [like, the most non-toxic i've seen in a while] and the game has some pre-made games that are cool to hang out in like Laser Tag, Paintball, Dodgeball, And a few pre-made dungeons. AND THAT'S NOT MENTIONING PLAYER-MADE GAMES! Oh BOY these are cool. Let me give you an example: I went to someone's game called ""The Town"" It's a neighborhood-style PVP game with a few guns sprinkled around the area which featured a working train, a store with a lot of guns in it for free [basically where you would go to stack up on your arsenal] and stuff like that, they even had some dude working as a cashier for the fun of it. Like for a PVP game with guns and stuff like that, they formed kinda ""groups"" of sorts that would raid the shop and it was pretty cool.
Definately give this game a try. And If you don't know how to interact with people in this game too much, here's some games that have least to most social interaction so you can smoothly start to understand the social stuff of this game: Start with some of the normal games like Laser-Tag, then Paintball, then Dodgeball, and then to Player-Made games. By then you'll be good to go. And you can make a few friends by just waving to people!
Anyways that's all I've got to say. Thanks for reading this whole essay that I could probably give to my english teacher for extra credit lol.","Apr 18, 2021 at 12:14 PM",5, 45,

2022-05-28 16:03:13.129929,LuckyBastardSax,Almost perfect,"So far this is the  VR game i had the most fun with.

Cons: teleporting in some of the official games has you staying in between teleports for about a second which somewhat forces you to adapt to moving instead of teleporting. i firstly got a little motion sickness in vr, but can handle it better now (tipp: act like youre walking (with your legs and feet) while moving)

Pros:  Vast amount of different (mini)games included with the opportunity to create more (if you are able and willing to). in them, there is some variation to how you control yourself, which is not a problem but needs you to switch brainwise. the community is asked to be overly nice (too nice for me), but if they oblige or dont is nothing the devs should be held accountable for. so in overall i bought several VR games but this is the one i regularily return to. great work","May 6, 2021 at 1:58 AM",5, 3,

The only thing bad about this game is that there is a lot of toxicity in certain rooms. But if you stick to the original rooms it will be fine. I would recommend playing quests and paintball those are personally my favorite.

2022-05-28 16:03:25.705295,bucket_r,Rec Room is a great VR experience.,"In total, I've played this game for around 1000+ hours at this point. The Rec Room developers have put a lot of time in this game and I applaud them for making an amazing social experience, even out of VR. The in-game creation tools are easy to learn, require almost no coding/3d modeling experience at all. The rooms and worlds I see created in this game almost everyday are fun to play with your friends and family. There are small hangout rooms to relax in and fast-paced shooters that are all created by the UGC tools that Rec Room provides. Content created by the developers (RRO games) are just as good, maybe even better. There are PVP games like Paintball and Laser Tag along with PVE rooms (Quests) so you can team up with your friends to bring down goblin armies and robots all in the style of a traditional school play. Overall Rec Room is a fun experience for casual gamers and is meant to be that- a casual free-to-play experience. There is also room for competitive gamers in the form of leaderboards for PVP games and Quests, and they encourage you to be good at the game for rewarding prizes and cosmetics you can style your avatar with.","Dec 24, 2020 at 4:14 PM",5, 44,

But i've played every rec room original so many times that i have run out of items to get so now there is basically no rewards for me to get. With the new reward system it makes it almost impossible to get any of the in game currency. The only way to get it now is to pay for it. I would play the community games but most of them are either poorly made and the good ones are few and far between. The updates to the game haven't been the best most of the updates now have been primarily for screen mode players and dont at all impact those on their main platform of VR.","Jan 24, 2021 at 10:42 AM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 16:03:35.167985,Logan_colon,A bug-filled money grab,"So to make a long story short, the developers stopped caring about the game. The last update completely broke it for my quest and the only feature added, (or should I say removed), was the ability to gain tokens for free. You now HAVE to buy tokens to get cosmetics. I've been grinding for the three years I've had this game for an overpriced outfit only for the lazy devs to remove the only way I can get tokens. 

It's not longer about fun, the only cosmetics you can get are from quests - which rarely anybody who has a brain plays. I'm left with a game that barely launches to begin with, that crashes often, and no ability to get tokens. There is no reason to play it anymore and I don't see myself downloading it again in the future.  

That's not even the worst part. There are community managers in the game who will ban you if you make their friend angry. I was in a game with someone who got their moderator friend in to ban a person playing around in the rec center. Thank goodness the person left before then. 

This game went downhill fast. It's lost all my respect and I'm sad that the developers have just given up essentially. I can't recommend this game until actual change takes place for once.","Dec 11, 2020 at 5:40 AM",1, 16,

Everything in this game is very entertaining because of the interactivity and creativeness the developers encourage everywhere. The community, however, can change depending on where you find yourself to be in the places you visit.

2022-05-28 16:04:00.420444,NOTaSaltyPerson,Awesome game!,"Ok, so now I've put 1,000+ hours on this game. This game is the second closest thing that we'll get to the OASIS from ready player one. Gameplay is pretty straight foward, and some people prefer to skip this game because it looks like another version of roblox, but it isn't just roblox VR, there are some rec room original games that are very popular, not just the community rooms and there aren't as many toxic kids. Anyway, this game is awesome as hell, you'll get to meet lots of people and get to hang out with them! Not to mention the community rooms are pretty epic, from running through a maze getting chased by freddy fazbear to defeating an ancient mummy inside a pyramid to hanging out in a fairy like forest with your friends, this have has a wide variety of rooms, and you can make your own as well! Though it's hard, it's worth it at the end! Now, this next part honestly depends on what you're playing on, but since you're reading this in the oculus store, then I imagine you're on oculus rift or S, this game will run decently, depending on what you're doing, it might lag or crash here and there, but overall, it runs pretty well. If you're on quest, it will run decently, you might crash while loading into a room, but since against gravity (the creators) are working hard, I imagine that they will improve the performance in the future. Graphics are fine, nothing special, but not CoD Modern Warfare 2 graphics. Now, there are microtransactions so you can get tokens (the in game currency you can use to buy clothing items), but that's totally optional, you can still get a bunch of tokens daily, and I really like that! Now, some items are insanely priced, like a pair of cat ears for 9k tokens? holy frick, but the flip side of that coin is that there are this rr original games called ""quests"", you can get a team of people and clear levels of enemies. If you get s, or s+ (depending on what quest you're playing), you can get the best gear that everyone wants, for free! So you don’t have to pay a penny to get the best (and most flashy) gear! Let’s talk about the community, so there’s this room called the “rec center”, which is like a hub for people to hang out in, you’ll find 3 types of rec centers, either everyone is wearing expensive and flashy gear and are playing music in the mirror room, or you’ll find kids being annoying, or just a normal rec center where everyone is chill. Sure, there are some bad apples in the community, but it’s mostly toxic free. And my only complaint of this game also applies to the community. Some mods are so sensitive, if you make a joke that even slightly criticizes them, they’ll ban you for 3 days, that’s just ridiculous. But overall, this game has its ups and downs, but I really enjoy playing it every time I get the chance!","Sep 2, 2020 at 10:43 AM",5, 23,

I really love rec room because of its cross platform and accessibility, it also has custom rooms, costumes, and items. In my opinion the quests are the best rooms, they are coop dungeon crawlers where up to 4 players have to take out all the enemies in the level to proceed to the next, and in the final level in each quest there is a boss. I also like that they are all school plays. My second favorite mode is rec royale which is a battle royale where 16 players fight using weapons from the quests, laser tag, and paintball while running away from the swarm (the rec royale equivalent of the storm. My third favorite room is stunt runner where up to 4 players have to race to the end of a course in the style of shows like wipeout or american ninja warrior. Rec room also has generic sports like dodgeball, soccer, disk golf paddle ball and other sports. Also you dont even need a vr headset to play.

2022-05-28 16:04:06.744530,Hey_Jude,Exceptional Game with some Feedback,"Honestly, this is an amazing game! I've been playing this for months on end, and this has been such a huge help during the COVID quarantine period. Thank you so much for keeping this free, the remarkable gameplay, and opening it up to all different kinds of players. (Xbox, Mobile, VR, etc...)

However, I'd like to definitely like to see a few more things:

1. Paying Creators for their top rooms, so it adds a bit more incentives for building stuff.

2. Please create more games like Golden Trophy, Crimson Cauldron, etc... Getting a bit tired of playing those over and over.

3. Add more attainable items from games, and make them more difficult. Seems like getting all of the items are fairly trivial.

4. For creators - Making it easier to use or even understand the circuitry, or even make it easier to create a lobby, etc.

5. Speed up the paintball lobbies a little bit by like 5 seconds.

6. If I mute everyone but my friends, everyone shouldn't be able to hear me. It almost feels like an invasion of privacy.

7. Allow for group chats without distance, so that I can communicate with team members without being closer to them. Obvs optional for some game types, but this would be awesome with some friends in paintball.

8. PLEASE make more paintball maps, or at least all for creators contribute maps, if they go through some vetting process.

2022-05-28 16:04:09.892111,jhony_sens,Almost Perfect,"Firstly, I want to say that this is one of the best VR games I've ever played. There are virtually endless possibilities for games in Rec Room. The community is welcoming and kind, and there are so many talented creators that create rooms and games of all kinds for all kinds of players. I would like to voice two rather important grievances. First, there are far too many kids on this game, as in >10 years old. They're often obnoxious and rude, and will frequently abuse the moderation system, which leads into my next point. My second issue is that the moderation system is far too easy to abuse. It's not that uncommon to see other players getting wrongfully kicked from a game or even banned. The abundance of young children ties into this, as if a group of kids decide that they don't like you or even just one gets mad at you, they can get you kicked from a game (this locks you away from that game/instance of said game), or worse, they can file a bunch of false reports against you. This will trigger an automatic ban, with no consequences for those that reported you unless you can prove that they're in the wrong, which you won't likely be able to do. I've been banned for several days at a time before because some kid got mad at me for killing him in a game. Don't let this discourage you, though! Rec Room is an extremely fun game that honestly should be worth more than free. You'll obably find good friends and make great memories! Of my many hours put into this game, I can't say that a wasted any of them!","Sep 13, 2020 at 11:52 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 16:04:09.966911,OdgeBodge,Ruined by updates,"The lastest update changed the mirror ui yet again to cater to screen mode players over VR players who have been playing from the start and helped make this game what it is today. Having to use a 2D ui in VR is possibly one of the worst feelings i have ever experiance because it feels so un-natural. The old wardrobe system where your items would be in a circle around you was so much nicer because you could actually see the item in a 3D space and grab it and actually put it on your body, the new ui just makes you tap a 2D image of the item. Both the Mirror UI and the Clubs UI feel bad and out of place. This is the reason VR plays dont like screen mode players, the inclusion of them is ruining the game for us and the addition of IOS players felt like a step too far for VR players everywhere. 

Theres no real reason why the UI in the VR version of the game and the screen version of the game cant be different. You need to remember about the people who have loved your game since the begining and stuck around for years because it feels like you dont even reaslise they exist anymore. Its a real shame to see whats happened to this game.

This game feels like a VR port now.","Jul 22, 2020 at 9:04 PM",1, 15,

The content ranges from user made (mind blowingly awesome how cool the user made rooms and activities are) to Developer made activites like several fun coop Quests, paintball, lasertag, dodgeball, charades, so much more that I just cant list and label here. Crossplay with PSVR, Steam, Quest, IOS, and Flat screen.

2022-05-28 16:04:32.051841,Crumbled_Sanity,Dear Developers... Fix your game.,"When I first started playing Rec-Room way back, I've had little to no problem with stuttering, let alone freezing that would essentially crash my game. Everything was nice and dandy despite some previously nice features being removed.

Fast forward now and it has become way too apparent that the developers have failed to actually care for the game properly as stuttering and freezing has got to a point of the game being unplayable. This seems to happen if something spawns/despawns/dies or whatever so PVP or anything that involves teleportation which is most community made games.

Is the game impossible to play? No, of course not.
Is the game bad? Other than a toxic community at times, no.
Is the game in dire need of fixing? Definitely.

Unless this freezing and stutering issue gets fixed, I am leaving a 2 star review in hopes that this issue finally gets resolved one day.","Jun 16, 2020 at 12:51 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:04:32.068796,Sp4rt4n777,"would rate 2.5, here's why....","The game IS made by Against Gravity, but MOST of the content is made by the community and the players. Yes, there are rules in this game and they are all quite simply a Code of Conduct as what would pertain to real life. And here's where we start going downhill... The Devs aren't necessarily in control of their own ruling system. The banning system is dependent on the community and there can be some toxic players who abuse this power by getting their friends to start banning certain players they don't like. And if that player gets enough reports on them they get a 24hr, 2 day, 7 day, 2 week, or a month. Here's the catch, there is no proofread system to say whether there was false banning or if it actually happened. So if you happened to get banned, you are guilty with no justice of being innocent. This rant is more a warning to PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. i've played enough to love this game, up until this banning system was placed in. and the only 'new' content is what players make. if you so wish to still try this game, i'm not stopping you. this is my review of why i'm still 50/50 about this game.","Apr 21, 2020 at 5:19 AM",3, 17,

But back to the main points. It has a lot of cool activities and maps to choose from and they are super cool. The game takes away a lot of the violence by using water gun models instead of real gun models as the weapons.
My review is positive so far, but lets get to the bad thing. The bad thing is, that the community is VERY mixed. It either has very nice people or toxic PS4 players that say the n-word to everyone. I am not going to write about the nice people because I have already said it, they are nice people. But the PS4 players. They are on a WHOLE new level of toxic. When you join a pvp or a competitve game like rec room royale, you can only hear them scream fortnite callouts and other things in their mics. They also cuss every 3 seconds. So if you want to have peace and quiet, just don't play shooters on rec room. But if you want to play them, then I recommend muting the PS4 players or blocking them. Otherwise, the game is flipping amazing. I recommend the game.","Jul 2, 2020 at 6:51 AM",5, 0,

3.  Lots of avatars items to choose from once you earn or purchase tokens
4.  Great place to meet new people, play with real life friends
5.  Addictive, Rec Royal is one of my favorite things in VR.  The biggest let down is that it is not ported for Oculus Quest, and its the only reason I bought Oculus Quest.

The Bad
1.  Slow updates if any to in app games, Rec Roayl Season 1 has been in place for two years with 0 updates, no new tier prizes, and no indication that Season 2 is anywhere in the near future.
2.  Too many children since the release of PSVR.  When I first started placing Rec Room in 2016 it was basically all adults, those that could afford pc vr.  There were plenty of skilled payers even up until about mid 2018.  However, so many children had taken over the game due to psvr, that you couldn't go anywhere without them scaling weapons in custom rooms lagging out games crashing people.  Kids screaming non-stop even on adult (over 13) accounts.  That many of the adults and skilled players left Recroom for good.  Finding quality players is much harder than it used to be, and if your an adult making friends is also much more difficult.
3.  You get weekly challenges, which I enjoy and keeps me playing.  But many times they repeat weekly rewards, meaning if you already have the weekly prize you have 0 goals/rewards to work for and or to try and earn that week.  For example I waited all year for the new Halloween weekly to find out its the same big Halloween weekly prize from last year.  Last year it was a ghost wand, so I had hoped this year it would be a ghost sword or ghost bow, but instead exact same weekly as last years major Halloween prize.
4.  Bugs.  They actually have fixed quite a few bugs I've reported to them and in some of the ideas I had on how to fix them.  But new bugs get released with each update they push out.","Dec 20, 2019 at 4:21 PM",5, 15,

Because I was no longer stuck with limitations and I was able to do anything in the game and I wouldn’t get picked on for being a screen mode anymore and especially the building aspect which is the main reason I still play this game and the social aspect because irl I have social anxiety but on here I don’t because there’s so many people like me on Rec Room. So I would like to give the team at Rec Room Inc for creating such a life changing game that I’m still currently playing.
And the reason I wrote this reviewing the Oculus store  because at the end of August 2019 I started playing on the Oculus Rift which improved my experience with the enhanced tracking.","Oct 13, 2019 at 9:01 PM",5, 70,

This game hands down is one of the most underated and most fun game I've ever played, even beating most or possibly all the paid and free games I've ever bought or gotten. This game has so much activities that can last you for days on end, there are quests such as Golden Trophy, Crimson Couldren, there are pvp games like Paintball or Laser Tag, and casual games such as Disc Golf or 3D Charades! And if the Rec Room Original games start to make you boared then there are thousand apon thousands of player created games that are all possible due to Rec Room's player friendly creation tool, the maker pen, the maker pen lets you create anything, and when I mean anything I mean ANYTHING. The creation tool has so many features, you can make you own object with the shapes menu which also lets you choose from a bunch of textures and colors, theres a prop menu that lets you spawn in Rec Room Original Props such as barrels, guns, bounce pads, etc. There circuts, gizmos, and emmiters which let you create small or huge contrapitons with particles from the emitters such as confetti or fireworks. And with the inventions menu you can save and reuse creations. Rec Room also have ready good and helpful staff that can help you with building, circuts, or players. And the thing that Rec Room takes the cake for is, socializing. You can talk, play, or create rooms with people all around the globe. You can find the nicest people ever in Rec Room, and if you find someone toxic you can block and report them! So, this is why I believe Rec Room is the best game ever.

You can mute individual, or all player chatting which is nice. The game itself however is very positive. Great wholesome environments, entertaining games, and you'll run into some really cool people. It's a great addition to your VR collection. From paintball to charades it's great. I'm giving it a five for the polished and great graphics. The only bummer of course is when you go into a lobby with no one else. The game is pretty busy however, so you rarely run into an issue with being able to play with other people.

The game used to be completely free, which meant the bugs and few content updates were fine, but that is no longer the case. There are very few content updates added into Rec Room (only one this year) and one new set of items added into a quest. Other than that, they have only messed with creator tools (and broke/changed things that didn't need to be changed) and added things to their in game store. The in-game earning of tokens to buy items is far to low, and in order to afford anything you must spend (on average) 10$ for most items, with some cases going up to 20$ for a single item. Just to wrap this up, here is a quick list of other things: Making people community moderators who have no qualification to do so (immature); adding endless bugs and never fixing them; a terrible community (example: it is rare to go into a Rec Center without hearing the N Word; and lastly, a white-knight fanbase that will respond to any minor critique of Rec Room as a personal attack.","Oct 23, 2019 at 10:17 AM",2, 11,

----------

Update: The previous review was made March 14th, 2017. It is now September, 2018 and I just lowered my rating from 5 stars to 2.  

The direction the game is taking is not a good one. The latest patch is a mess and very few are happy with it. They've decided to try to mix two seperate locomotion types, modify a motion type, and add non-VR users all in the same patch. It's going as smoothly as you'd imagine. The devs have made statements that clearly indicate they wont reverse direction.   
  
This was once my asolute favorite VR game. I've spent thousands of hours in it. I held a top 10 spot on the all-time global leaerboard of paintball for over a year. But I give up. The community and experience will only continue to deteriorate and I'm not interested in sticking around and watching it happen. I'd just be clinging to the shell of my former VR home.","Aug 31, 2018 at 5:28 PM",2, 229,"Sorry to see you go damontoo!

This issue is in both Desktop and VR mode.  VR mode doesn't register my voice or show any audio activity even though I tripple checked that the hardware was working.  But if I load VRChat from the Oculus software my microphone works great.  If I load Rec Room in desktop mode it says my microphone is not detected no matter what I do, including disabling all other audio devices.

This problem does not exist in the Steam version of Rec Room and I've been forced to use that version at this point which requires additional steps to launch on my Oculus.

Bans of that length are only put in place by Rec Room staff and only after reviewing every report for accuracy and all evidence gathered on the account.

All the games are incredibly fun, but I’m not giving this a five star because of the Screen Mode addition.  The community of Screen Mode seems to be a little more toxic, as others say, but I have only met a handful of Screen Mode players that have been toxic during a game.  Overall though, the community is not extremely happy with the addition, leaving some rooms bare and deserted.  
The positive aspect of Rec Room is far more glaring, though.  The quests are great, and the Mew Crescendo Quest is fantastic, and feels like a whole new quest, and not just a copy and paste (not saying the other quests are).  The other games are really good and function exactly how they are supposed to.  The sports side of Rec Room is a little bare, but normally if you wait a minute or two, a few players will have joined.  
Overall, Rec Room is a great game, and even though the community is in a tough spot right now, I think that in the future the game will continue to improve.  I’d rate this game a 4/5, but I would rate it a 5/5 if I disregarded the Screen Mode problem.","Aug 29, 2019 at 8:30 AM",5, 3,

VR and screen players are already separated by matchmaking when there are enough players in a room to support separate instances. This is called split matchmaking. When there are only a small number of players in a room they are all put into the same instance so that a game can start. If a creator wants to only support specific platforms like only VR players every room has this option! So if they want to make the choice to create much longer wait times or low population games if not many people are online in that room, creators have that option!

I have made great friends on here and have actually help me develop social skills that I wouldn't be thankful for due to an amazing social game like Rec Room. There is only a problem that isn't terrible, The community is toxic ever since the add of screen players. People are disrepecting private conversations with people by just interrupting without asking. If you go into a popular room with over 15+, Oh boy. Prepare your self for a treat. There would be people spewing racial slurs and no one bothers to report them. Again, This issue is pretty over blown if you know how to get over it. As Rec Room always states, ""Talk to the hand"" If someone is being disrepectful.

I will say 1 thing that me and everyone I know is having trouble with and it’s that it’s the performance of it, I just wish it was a we bit easier to run that’s all. 

The way with the maker pen and making things is great but also I wish it was just a small bit easier to use with making certain shapes but in an overall it’s a really fun game to play.

but out of the 4 hours I played I met a total of 3 people who were decent out of at least 100. The rec center (the social meetup place) is literally filled with tweens? Maybe younger as I think I got begging from what sounded like a 6 year old. spouting obcenities, chasing you around and flat out trolling, screaming throwing stuff racist slurs, so much for a code of conduct. 
I figured I would let the kids be kids and just start playing games - I'm a die hard RPG fan so I thought I join in on the questing fun. Out of the 6 runs I did with random people I was PK purposely at least a dozen times before the game even started. Of course we kick but then another one decides to PK everyone on the final boss. 
Such a shame that the VR social community right now is pretty much the wild west. This is the exact reason why I stick to SP games though I THOUROUGHLY enjoy MP sessions with like minded people.

The game is reward based, providing players with daily challenges, and players are rewarded by levelling up and recieving items to customise their appearence further within the game. The physics and art style are pleasing. The game is like a club, and you quickly become friends with many of the people you meet and play games with.

It has been an absolute pleasure watching the game change and grow over the last few years and I am grateful for every second I've been allowed to live in this amazing virtual world. I have met so many people and done so many things that I never thought I'd be able to do in my life and I absolutely cherish all of the memories this great game has given me.

This is where VR is going, and it's all free and constantly improving.  Only downside I see is that performance isn't that optimized, its pretty CPU dependent and has occasions server-side lag but only during really popular hours.  Oh yeah and the user created content and creation experience is pretty amazing with endless possibilities, though I haven't explored that as much.","Apr 12, 2019 at 8:50 PM",5, 7,

There's paintball, Laser tag, Rec Royale, and a co-op Laser tag Quest! You Like Melee/Mid range combat? Most of the Co-op quests focus on that! Are you a sports fan? There's Soccer (Or Football, but I call it Soccer. Don't hurt me please.), Paddleball, Dodgeball, and, while not a full game, you can play Basketball. Do you like more tame experiences? You got Charades, or you can make your own custom room! And speeking of which, Even if none of this sounds appealing to you, You can make or play custom rooms, Which are games made by the community. And if all that DID sound appealing to you, custom rooms provide even more content to sink your teeth into!
There's also weekly challenges that, once completed, reward you with weapon skins, which keeps the game fresh. 
And to top it all off, despite there being voice chat, the large majority of the community isn't toxic! Huzzas all around!
Truly a 10/10 game. Even if it was 60 dollars, I'd buy it!
(P.S: I would talk about the game more, but all this writing about it has made me wanna play it. Also no, Despite my review almost looking like an ad, I wasn't paid by the devs to say this, the game is just that good.

Then i have to spend many hours searching through 100's of circuits trying to figure out what is broken. I logged in today and found the same problem.  I spent a month building a custom boss battle to find out its broken and because i have more than one room grouped together it randomly chooses any room i have created to take me to. Random rooms not even grouped with the main room.  How can i save and update the room if i can't even enter it.

good addition.

****NEW Update***** Jan 2019 this game has gone so far down hill its beyond help! every time I go on now I get called a cheat as I use teleport then end up leaving, I no longer regard this a  VR game and more of a game to play just on a flat screen monitor. 



After a few months of playing this I think it needs a follow up review......WOW I`ve not played on line since 1999 on my Unreal Tournament clan days, Rec Room is the best, funest, coop multi player game I`ve played in years, I`m on this most days have got some good friends on there, and albeit Ive done the quest a few times I still go back and play them again, you need to play this game  with friends and have fun, we need more Quests like the Crimson Cauldron, golden trophy and Jumbotron....Please,
Ok thats the good bit, my only downer with this game is the kids that just mess about and perants that seem to use VR as a baby sitter and that my only gripe with it really.

September 2018 update...
Have knocked down the rating as the this is still being used as a baby sitter club, the update does nothing for the game and you can see the direction the game is going (console/kids only) done all the quests but it offers nothing new royal is not for everyone, i was hoping for another quest along the lines of the ""wild west"" 
but I have now come to the end of my time on Rec Room that use to be my goto game everynight......
if you like screaming/ loud kids its the game for you.","Jan 7, 2019 at 6:36 AM",1, 15,

They really helped me come out of my shell and taught me that it's ok to be yourself. Plus, the Rec Room Originals are super fun and infectiously re-playable (once I got 20 win streaks on Rec Royale).  And mamma mia, the user-created rooms are out-of-this-world amazing. It's incredible to see what actual humans can do with a Maker Pen: recreating classic movie locations, making super detailed costumes, even crafting entire LANDSCAPES. They're truly a sight to behold. This game has taught me love (friends, rooms), patience (quests, learning to use the Maker Pen), and pain (losing matches and quests) and I wouldn't trade a minute of my time I spent there for ANYTHING.

Pros
•It’s very social
•It has cross platform play for people on PC and PSVR
•The official Rec Room minigames, such as paintball, laser tag etc. are all fun and fair
•With the daily/weekly challenges and community rooms, there is always new things to do
•You cannot buy in game currency with real money, making the in game currency system fair for everyone
•The music is great
Cons:
•It is unstable and often crashes and freezes
•People occasionally lose contact with the servers for long periods of time

2022-05-28 16:07:07.487107,brutius,Fantastic Game,"There are many games within this game.  I spend most of my time in Quests, and playing Paintball.  The 4v4 co-op competition is excellent.  The immersion is near perfect.  This is by far my Go To game.  and, it is FREE!  what?!?  Thanks RecRoom Dev's!
Update on March 18, 2018:  This is still my favorite game by far.  SO much fun in paintball and quests.  Can't get enough.  Note to folks who want to get away from the kids: whenever you find some adult you like playing with, ""Friend"" them (shake hands).  As you rank up, you will be matched with better players, and less often with kids.  I am rank 30 and have friended many great adults, and I rarely encounter 'screaming kids'.  The matchmaking system is good.   Also, if you are with someone annoying, you can just go into your watch and start the activity over again and you will be matched up with different people.

Update October 23, 2018:    Still a 5 star game.   Some old timers don’t like change, especially when they added walking and screen mode.   But the game continues to grow, content keeps improving, and I still play every day.    By far my number 1 game.    (SkyrimVR is my #2, and BeatSaber is #3 for me)","Oct 25, 2018 at 12:11 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 16:07:10.663612,JoshTheFix,Rec Room Review: Crescendo Of The Blood,"Crescendo Of The Blood Moon (I'm going to refer to it as CBM) is the newest quest and it is amazing. For one the quest had effort put into it just like the others. CBM has a whole load of references to other gamemodes in Rec Room such as ""The Duke Of Roy"" being a direct reference to Ranger Roy in Rec Royale, just to name one. I already have the highest rank of gear you can achieve in the quest (S+) and i was playing with friends when getting S+. However, it didn't feel like we were grinding to get the items, it felt as if we we're just playing the quest and not focusing at all on every movement an enemy makes. 
Unlike ILS (Isle of Lost Skulls) where it was legit quest hell to get S rank, CBM made S rank (and S+) easy to achieve if you remember spawns and have 2 friends with you. In conclusion the new quest is amazing and also the whole game is amazing too so if there was one thing i'd say about Rec Room, well i might just say ""There's room for everyone""

2022-05-28 16:07:13.822164,SebThorstVR,My Favorite VR game,"As of me writing this, Rec Room is my favorite VR game. It is alot of fun and a great platform to make friends, and it has alot of cool games too like the quests (Cresendo of the Blood Moon is pretty hard It think I just need to play the game more)

My Pro's
Great platform to make friends as I did make friends (I Just need to play more)
Good Gameplay, almost all the games I find fun
ITS FREE

My Cons
With Rec Royale I really want to complete the frontier pass before it ends but the game is really repetitive, I usally only play one game and go ""Yep, Im done"" I think something like Fortnites weekly challenges would be a good addition, so getting frontier rewards are easier to get
VR is pretty expensive, so its pretty cool there is a non VR mode, but all my friends without Vr dont wanna play Rec Room in screen mode because ""Its not that fun without VR"" I feel Rec Room needs to expand upon Screen mode, so it would actually be fun for my friends without VR","Nov 20, 2018 at 7:43 AM",5, 4,

All in all, good game, some updates should've stayed as an idea and the community is toxic (except for some people). 

Edit: I haven't been on Rec Room in a long long time because of all the trollers and the people who think doing humping kids are funny. Don't forget the kids who also scream as loud as they can into the mic. Nobody bothers to report them. I really love the game, I do.

On the other, The game is not taken into great depths. After playing the few minigames and exploring custom rooms, I found myself bored within 15 minutes of gameplay. Hopefully the developers expand this game further.

EDIT: 3 months after posting this review, I've decided to move this review up from three stars to four. The devs have been putting more and more work into delivering fun content that actually makes you want to come back to the game. Especially with the new ""Rec Royale"" gamemode, it feels like the devs actually care about the user's experience. For a free game, I'd really recommend this to everyone. I do believe that the devs are able to add more however, such as (perhaps) a system where you are able to set the prices and sell retired clothings to other players. Maybe then my review will find it's way into it's fifth star.","Nov 7, 2018 at 10:27 AM",4, 1,

I do wish that teleporting in shooting games was disabled as it is an unfair advantage that people abuse often. Also screen mode is pretty cheap although I don't have a problem killing most of them. I can only stand to play this game late at night when less people are on (game runs flawlessly) because during the day it lags extremely bad and it makes me nauseated literally. VR when smooth feels fine to me but introduce skippy screens and I want to vomit. I wish they would expand the server so that It wouldn't lag during the day.

Now with that being said, what I admire the most about the game is it's surprising gain in a player base, and how a large amount of them actually play this game in VR. It was difficult for me to start playing the game by the dialy, but over time the charm and appeal grew on me.

Now granted, it has a more child focused audience, but there are some adults  who actively enjoy this. The mechanic of having private/custom rooms is what makes this game even better. I've always believed that having your game be as modder friendly as possible can make it a fantastic game, and Rec Room is no different. I do hope they add more stuff to this, and maybe even more custom content support, but for now, it's a good enough example on how VR multiplayer can work if it's executed correctly.","Oct 5, 2018 at 5:25 AM",5, 0,

But it's still my absolute favorite game and it's still super fun.

To start with,  3/4 of the new players this month obviously came from Fortnite. Rec Royale was a cheap way to get new players into the game. There are many glitches (you can get under bucket lake and kill people above you) .Also half of the people who play are annoying trolls  or salty kids. I nearly got banned because this other kid thought I was annoying and reported me. Speaking of reporting, reporting doesn't matter . You think they read reports? Wrong if you get reported 2 or 3 times even  if the reports are false, you get banned. So salty kids reporting you for killing them in Rec Royale is common and easy to pass through the reporting system. No one plays other mini games and tokens are now limited to 60 per day, and you can only change your name 3 times a week? What is the point of these changes? Im done with these pointless updates and buggy gamemodes","Jul 10, 2018 at 10:14 AM",1, 7,"Hello Piercing,

2022-05-28 16:08:27.132086,WozzaTheWalrus,Great game that keeps on giving,"Rec Room is truly one of the best VR games out there. And it's free!

Pros:
+Regular updates with new content
+A huge variety of content.
+FREE!
+Games are challenging, but not overly difficult.
+The community is AWESOME. I haven't run into a single ragey person in the year or so I've been playing.
+CROSS PLATFORM PLAY. That's right. You can play with Oculus, Steam, and PSVR players. In-game friends system works well enough.

Neutral:
=Kids. I work with kids, so sometimes I don't want to hear another obviously <13 year old in the game. Reporting system for under 13 works though. Use it people!
=Latest UI update for the watch menu is unintuitive. Usually I hate UI updates but I'll give it some time.
=Making a party is sometimes kinda wonky.

Cons:
-I think with the addition of custom rooms, the Rec Center doesn't have as many people as before, which kind of ruins the atmosphere of the game for me.
-Many people cheat at games by going into walls. This isn't usually a problem in competitive games, but I don't like it when a teammate does it in co-op.","May 16, 2018 at 7:50 AM",5, 3,

Thanks for the feedback! We're always working on improving the physics systems.

Honestly, this game is the most fun I've had in ages, vr or not. It comes with some casual and competitive PvP games, as well as some co-op PvE ones, but there's no aimbot, little salt, and raging/rulebreaking/afk people can easily be votekicked if necessary. 

So social mechanics are cool, but how does it play? I'm glad you asked. All mechanics are consistent, reliable, and polished across all gamemodes, so learning curves are quick and disorientation minimal. It feels like a combination of the best parts of Wii Sports, Roblox, and VRChat. Plus, this game is cross-platform with PSVR and HTC Vive.

All Rec Room players are on the same servers. Oculus Home, Steam, and PSVR players all connect to the same rooms and experiences. So there are just as many players no matter what way you are connecting to Rec Room. It sounds like you prefer Steam which is fine, but we'd like to see what you actually think of Rec Room rather than the platforms we use.

2022-05-28 16:09:50.201904,Strichcode,Best VRMultiplayer game in history.,"Rec Room is the best Multiplayer game for Virtual Reality. 
Reasons for that is simple: They make the game with love. Not just for jumping on the VRTrain. 
The controls are pretty simple. The games are pretty simple. The graphics are pretty simple. But thats good. Its family friendly. 
This game has many minigames you can play - some alone some only with other players. 
They have Adventure, Paintball, and other funny games. 

The only thing i want, that they add Tennis and other sports games. Like bowling and so on. That would be AWESOME!

Overall this game is just plain awesomeness. Try it, if you want. Alone or with buddys. If you want to make new friends here is the way to make some.","Dec 15, 2017 at 8:20 PM",5, 5,

And on it went. Lame teleport mechanic with no simultaneous turn. No strafe or position shift in games which clearly need it. Oh, and it crashes constantly.

We take data privacy very seriously. We don't sell or share any player data. We operate off of venture capital investment. You can read more about it here if you like: https://www.geekwire.com/2017/inside-vr-hit-rec-room-gravity-breakthrough-virtual-reality-startup-seattle/ 

Also I'd like to clear up that children under 13 are allowed in Rec Room as long as they have parent / guardian permission and they are only active on a junior profile. You can read more about junior profiles here: https://www.againstgrav.com/help-center/  

You are correct that if you believe you have spotted underage activity on an adult profile you should report that using our moderation system. Thanks!"

If you are 12 or younger and were playing Rec Room previously you were doing so against our terms of service and Code of Conduct which required players to be 13 or older. Players 12 and younger were not allowed to play Rec Room at all! This is due to USA legal regulations for online activity for people 12 or younger. 

We spent a lot of time thinking about this problem and decided to put a lot of effort and resources into creating junior profiles that meet all of the regulatory provisions for players 12 and younger. This means that rather than you not being able to play previously, or trying to play and being permanently banned by the moderation system, you are now allowed to have a Rec Room account, as long as its approved by your parent or guardian. 

We just spent a lot of time updating our expresso menu which allows players a set of basic communication options that do not require a microphone. You can access this menu using the B or Y buttons on the touch controllers. Laser Tag will also become available to everyone once it is out of the alpha. At that point juniors will be able to play as well. 

If you or your parent would like to provide more feedback about your experience with your junior profile please contact us at support@againstgrav.com  Thanks!"

And the fact it’s FREE? That’s unbelievable. In fact, why are you even here reading this review? Go! Download it! Play; and experience it for yourself!

In all seriousness, this is an absolutely fantastic social app, with more (and better quality) individual games than many of the paid ones available. I’ve spent countless hours just chatting with new people, playing games and socialising and have yet to explore even half of the available content. Last week, posters appeared in the Rec Room advertising a Q&A session with the game developers at 5pm. I went to the main event room on time and had what was my most surreal VR experience to date… A full blown outdoor stage with the game devs on, and 50-60 player avatars sat in the audience, listening, laughing, asking questions and even asking to pose for virtual photos with the devs at the end of the session. Cannot recommend this game enough – I would GLADLY pay for Rec Room without thinking twice. Get it while it’s free!","Sep 20, 2017 at 3:56 AM",5, 5,"It was good to see you at the Q&A event!

With that said, I really hope that the developers continue working on this game and making improvements/adding new things, it really has a lot of potential beyond what it is right now. btw developers, if you're reading this: charades needs more cards added, after playing it a few times they start to repeat. 
also why is the teleportation mechanic so slow in games? the game would be a lot less frustrating if there werent a cooldown period on teleporting. i literally don't know how some people play dodgeball, its so hard to dodge with the slow teleport mechanic. 

Peeves: there are inevitably some rude/obnoxious folk lurking around, and they're generally pre/teenage boys whove just learned how to cuss. 
they can usually be ignored but for instance, today i watched a group of them ban some random person, merely because his avatar had dark skin, wtf. they were also going around harassing people.

Everytime you play it's different in one way or another. They have several very well-designed games including the most popular, Paintball, as well as 3D Charades, Quest for the Golden Trophy (a dungeon crawler game) and many others. You can communicate with people via your microphone, and it really does give you that experince of playing with others and allows you to properly work as a team. The game itself has a level-up system, as well as collectable wearables, which keep the game intresting. It has a very nice and cartoon-like art style as well as very good animations. This game was, however, designed for use with the HTC Vive, meaning they do not ustilise any aspect of the Touch Controllers, making it feel rather unnatural, however you will get used to it.

2022-05-28 16:11:55.332225,Thum0s,"Fun Social Games, Immature Community","Update: This game's community is bad and seems to be getting worse. Recently I haven't been able to play a single game of charades without either hearing d*ck jokes or seeing people draw pictures of d*cks. Out in the locker room, people are trying to give the punching dummy a d*ck by holding up dodgeballs and water bottles. On top of that, people are often mimicking sex acts, giving nazi salutes or drawing swastikas in charades and/or yelling out ""n*ggers"". Last night I ran into someone making fun of Mormonism and earlier in the week a group of people started harassing a Chinese player. 

All of this activity goes on while there are clearly kids who are under 13 playing the game. And while the kids who are under 13 are clearly breaking the rules, the worst behavior comes from the adults!

This game needs moderators who are online and take rule-breaking seriously. This game is turning into Lord of the Flies, VR edition. What happens when you put a bunch of people online with no real social structure to keep things from turning into one giant p*nis joke with simulated rape. UPDATE 2: So last night, for the first time ever, I saw some referees walking around the locker room and visiting charades. Thats good and we need more of that. Possibly even have the referees incognito, so it's not simply the case that people are well behaved while the ref is in and then immediately draw more p*nises when he/she leaves. I'm going to bump up my rating since the devs have shown some interest in keeping the community within the rules they established.","Feb 19, 2017 at 4:06 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 16:12:01.771004,Palidore,Rec Room is a VR-essential,"Among the handful of social VR apps out there, Rec Room stands tall as perhaps the best.  Not only is it a great social hub for casual fun and nonsense, but it features a handful of surprisingly fun, well-made games to play with friends and strangers alike.  

Despite being one of VR's earliest offerings, the experience is so well-polished.  Networking is easy and seamless.  Registering an account is as simple as taking a photo at one of many ""selfie booths.""  Making friends is as easy as giving someone a virtual handshake, and joining a party happens by giving someone a fist bump.  Transitioning from social hubs, to game arenas and back again, is a matter of looking at your virtual wristwatch, and selecting a room from there.

With Rec Room, everything just works, and it works intuitively.  It's fun, free, cross-platform, polished, and always populated.  That's why to me, Rec Room is an essential app that'll be a staple in the VR world for years to come.","Dec 18, 2016 at 5:24 PM",5, 6,

Most of those people are spawn killers. The locomotion when in a match is awful. This teleporting garbage needs to stop. The snap turning is weird too while not only is the world turned 60 degrees off what is supposed to be front (it can even show which direction is front and I try to stay positioned that way for best tracking) and that makes it super easy to get lost. It'd be great to be able to forget about it and just turn my body but then I loose tracking. Turning your view with the controller seems to not turn yourself reliably. What I expect to be a 90 degree turn turns into a 100 or 110 degree turn. This may not be the case but becuase the world is so messed up it's really hard to tell and causes further dissorientation.

I want to like this game. But due to poor spawn locations in paintball and getting super lost in what should be simple teleport here do this mechanics it's really hard. Adding a third camera here might help as far as tracking goes but that's still no real excuse for how easy it is to get lost in navigating.
