2022-05-28 17:09:59.877349,Bigblue115692,Cannot play boogeyman 2 on oculus quest2,I cannot get this game to load with the Oculus quest 2 and I believe because it is setup for the rift. I thought the rift library of games would be available for the quest 2 through the quest link. My quest link cable works great for DCS flight sim which I'd why I purchase the quest 2. The game will pop up on my quest 2 but i lose connection with the link every time.,Jul 26 at 5:15 AM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 17:09:59.921232,EffinAyeTV,Will Not Start,"I am giving 2 stars only because when I briefly got to see the graphics, the game looks cool and spooky. But it only started once and then froze. Now it only has a loading hour glass on the title screen. Not sure why, I really want to play it. I hope they fix this issue soon!","Oct 29, 2019 at 10:06 AM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 17:10:03.071805,GaryOpt,"Broken, Still!!!!","This darn game won't start. Bought it two or three months ago, figured they'd fix it by now. Still won't start. Broken games like these affect the quality of Oculus store overall. They should force developers to make software that actually work, or take the thing off the store all together.","Dec 10, 2018 at 9:24 AM",1, 9,

2022-05-28 17:10:03.114691,HiThere_,Rated ~4.83/5 by those who DID play it.,"SO UNFAIR !!! Of the hundreds of buyers only 10 voted, and 4 of them voted 1-star only because they couldn't fix their rare launch problem... so remove those 4 votes and this game is in fact rated 4.83/5 stars by the 6 users who DID play it. I fixed that launch problem ~2% of the players were having by switching both .EXE to Windows 7 compatibility, launching it once (works but no VR), then switching Windows 7 compatibility back off permanently (problem is fixed). My rating is 4 stars and i'm adding 1 star for how affordable it is, and because those few but harmfull 1-star votes are from a handful of users who would love to be able to play it too (or simply forgot to update their vote after it was solved for them).","Jan 20, 2018 at 8:16 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 17:10:06.252299,Crazy-Miami,"Maybe ok for HTC, Oculus stay away!!!","Controller doesnt respond the way it supposed to, neither rift controllers or xbox","Jan 4, 2018 at 10:32 AM",1, 2,"Hello, Only the right Oculus touch is needed for walking (analogue stick) and the flashlight (trigger) / A to recharge / B for menu.

Make sure you are centred / stood or sat correctly to the HMD origin when walking otherwise you will not rotate correctly. (Walking is only needed for the menu system and intro. The game is primarily stationary.

The left touch controller does not work / is unneeded.
The Xbox controller is also not supported as 9/10 users have a touch, and the touch is much better to use for the flashlight mechanic :)

If enough people want Xbox controller support as in the original, I will find a way to add it.

Note: You will acquire the flashlight after the introduction level."

I have recently updated the game with a patch that should have hopefully fixed this issue for those with the problem. I am guessing it's to do with slow internet / Oculus server response time as every time the game transitioned into a new level it would perform an entitlement check. I have now changed this so it only performs the check once at the boot up of the game. (Which as far as I'm aware no one had issues with initial boot).

If anyone is still having any loading issues with the game please let me know.
