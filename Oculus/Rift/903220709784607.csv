2022-05-28 13:49:53.201367,chris_gibbons,don't bother,Flat out non functional. Untill there is a fix this app is dead.,Sep 6 at 3:10 PM,1, 4,
2022-05-28 13:49:53.217324,Agent_Ironhawk,Not usable,Started the program and it comes up with basic learning the controls. Great except it asks for me to use a hand controller to start. Wait? What? Yeap I have the oculus touch controllers in my hand at the time and it asks for hand controller to continue. OK.. So i have my xbox controller hooked to my computer still no response from the program. Currently not usable.,"Jan 8, 2021 at 4:25 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 13:49:53.232284,MavericRFW,AMAZING app!!!,"This app is the sole reason I'm learning Blender for MANY things now. I can have both my monitors on, I can make an entire office exactly the way I want it because I can add 3D models to this. I feel more zen and organized on there than anything else. The only thing I need left is better screen positioning for myself. lol

The only thing I would like is a way to separate windows without having to make more screens and crop. There's an app on Steam that supposedly does it but I can't get it to work. Although, vSpatial does it as well in their own hard-coded sort of way.","Dec 29, 2020 at 12:54 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:49:53.247245,dchen,Great App,"I found VR toolbox is a great app that offers many things what other apps do not.  The dev put into a lot of thoughts into it, some details such as transparency behavior is awesome.  Save and restore room setup is extremely useful. It is my faviroite app for VR. However there could be some thing to improve further:
1) As many people mentioned, buttons and controls are comprehensive (a good thing) but not easy to get to. And the controls between left and right touch controller is the same. I think left and right controller can be dedicated to different buttons so that we would have more shortcuts directly, especially for video playing.

2) Zooming in and out window distance is probably one of the most frequent operations. However, it needs hold down joystick button and direction in the same time, that makes the operation less precise and less smooth. Suggest improve with my comment #1 above to utilize more buttons than one button doing two things in the same time.

I like the app and would like to see its suceess and get better and better.  I may have more comments when use more and more. Keep up the good work.","Dec 8, 2019 at 5:13 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 13:49:53.263202,Burnswell,Great but hard to use,"It's a theorhetically great program but it's taking some practice and it always feels like I'm fumbling in the dark to do anything. Sometimes you need to click the stick to select, sometimes it's using the trigger, sometimes it's using a button. The tutorial instructions need to be a lot clearer, the rule seems to be ""click on the stick for anything in a menu hovering over the controller but not for anything else"". (Idk if that's right.) With this many controls built in clarity is essential. (Eg. tutorial saying ""select from the menu"" should say ""click the stick to select from the menu"", even though we just brought up the menu using it it's not the intuitive choice.) Anyway, other than the steep learning curve it's actually a pretty amazing program. It needs a lot more polish it and clarity. (maybe context sensitive labels showing what every button does appear whenever you look at the controller.) Otherwise it could turn into a superior replacement for the Oculus OS.","Jul 5, 2019 at 6:21 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 13:49:56.406900,GMgregster94,My favorite VRDesktop App,"So I know a lot of people have given this a bad review, but honestly? I found it to be better than what people have been saying. I like that they have their own browser set up in there, so you can go on multiple websites, you can also properly multi-task without having the need of another monitor. 
Sure, the controls are a bit hard to get used to, but isn't that how some VR Apps and Games are like? 
I've seen people complain about things being ""blurry"", but I don't think they've ever done anything with VR before then? VR headsets themselves are a bit blurry, even apps like BigScreen VR and other Desktop apps have been blurry for me too, even some games like Robo recall have been as well. If anything, I've found VR Toolbox to be easy to see things in, as long as you don't place them incredibly far away.
What's cooler is you can add custom 360 skybox's, you can even import pictures in, and place props in your enviroment. 
I really do reccomend this app, sure it has issues, but it's the only Desktop app I've seen for VR that allows you to have multiple windows open, while also being able to use your desktop as well.
A suggestion for the creators, please fix your tutorial, I get stuck when it asks me to hold the trigger button, and rotate it a certain way, it does not do anything, but I'd like to maybe see a ""skip"" button, or just a fix, since I want to learn all the other things that I can do with this program.","Apr 5, 2019 at 1:03 PM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 13:49:56.422857,jon.crawford.7503,This has become my favorite app!,"Before I go into specifics: the gui in this app reminds of another very awesome non-vr tool, Magica Voxel, in the fact that it looks like was created by a coder for coders, yet then a tutorial was added which the other tool MV never did. what I mean is that for a coder like myself I ""get' what the author was going for in certain aspects that may not be so apparent to the average user, hence the learning curve others have noted.

Review:
I really love the simplicity of this app. You start with some 360 backgrounds and an eggchair. You can then import your own 360s, or even 3D Models. This aspect is cool because you can then add your own room and content, but I like to keep it simple for gaming. 

Now the Tutorial is lacking, It failed to continue at a certain point when wrapping up spawning windows. But I got the basics from it and could figure the rest out. 

My favorite part is the FPS mode for gaming.  This mode freezes the screen infront of you and ties the head tracking to the mouse. Now heres where it gets interesting: I have paid for both Tridef and VorpX. VorpX suxs. However, run your game in the highest 4:3 resolution you can tease your monitor to display (google hidden resoulutions) have Tridef running to get SBS 3D, put VR Tool box in FPS mode and turn on Stereoscopic. Now to make it look right check the box for Double Widescreen in VR ToolBox. Voila, Black Mesa, GTAV (Online too), or your favorite game in VR! Admittedly you still have to use either keyboard/mouse or a gamepad/racing wheel for your game.","Mar 15, 2019 at 9:57 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 13:49:56.437817,DaBobstah,Wish  I Could Delete this Review,"This software has a big learning curve and I'm still trying to figure it out and see how well it ultimately performs. I should have waited longer before giving it either a positive or negative review, so please just ignore this review for now.","Mar 14, 2019 at 2:06 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 13:49:56.453774,PeteAlexLaws,WARNING ABSOLUTELY NO WINDOWS 7 SUPPORT,"You should have make it clear that this will not run on Windows 7.
I now see you put a warning on Steam but I saw/purchased it here first.
I won't give a bad rating but I am disapointed at the lack of disclosure.
I'll just have to go back to using VR Desktop.","Nov 24, 2018 at 9:44 PM",3, 6,"Thanks for the honest review, it was definitely an oversight to not have that listed. We've recently updated to finally bring Windows 7 support to Oculus!"
2022-05-28 13:49:56.471726,Eraserprime,Useful Multitasking Virtual Desktop,"Pros:
Watching Videos well playing video games.
Multiple internet browsing screens open.
Windows have many customizations.
Virtual Keyboard
Comfortable Environments.
Does not crash.

Cons:
Huge learning curve, and controls are not easy to use.
Props are a novelty and many issues better off not bothering with them.
In app internet browsing windows can not use add-ons, therefore no netflix.

Bottom line, VR Tool is like going from DOS to Windows for virtual reality.  However, this product is unfinished , has a lot of work, and should still be earily access, but I am still going to use it.","May 20, 2018 at 6:10 AM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 13:49:59.584522,Wickian,"Incomplete tutorial, but still good","Once you figure things out, this is an application that can almost do it all as far as virtual desktops go.  The only thing I've found it's missing is a proper playback UI for standalone video screens.  Right now we're stuck with +/- 5 seconds which isn't all that useful.  If vr had higher resolution in general I would probably use this for everything, even standard pc gaming that doesn't tax my system.

I know I set up a few objects to mimic my desk, keyboard mouse and tower, locked them in place and I'm golden.   I'm good enough at typing that I don't need to see the keyboard to use it.","Jun 2, 2018 at 7:12 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:49:59.600481,ktwebb68,Garbage,"This may be the worst software I've ever used, VR or otherwise.  Holy h*ll this is poorly written, designed and implemented.  Tutorial is pathetic.  Couldn't go 5 minutes without crashing.  Crashes constantly after trying to get back in.  Literally crashes my entire system, Oculus, PC, the works.  This by the way on a machine with a i7 7700, GeForce 1080, SSD, Optane cache and 16GB of RAM.  Useless and a complete waste of money.  Buyer beware.  It's crap.  Stay far, far away.","Mar 31, 2018 at 10:06 PM",1, 21,"Hi ktwebb68. Without knowing specifically what is wrong, was it possible that you were using Windows 7 at the time?

Detaching Apps is just incredible. I'm awed by this application, It's the VR I've always dreamt about. People giving out bad reviews probably just don't take the time to set it up properly or are running lower end hardware configurations. Text is sharp and readable with post processing and Pixel Density on Max. Thanks for this masterpiece of VR App.","Oct 21, 2017 at 6:10 AM",5, 5,Thank you! :)

Being unable to uninstall it seems odd, and it not a case we've ever run into. Have you run an antivirus scan in a while? 

How much functionality have you been able to access when it works? Do you have more success with other VR programs?"
2022-05-28 13:50:02.733703,adamosk,Definitely not for gaming,"I tried to play some games with it (Middle Earth, Call of Duty MW3, Far Cry Primal etc) but unfortunately it was impossible. Most of the times the screen was either black or frozen. 

Besides games, I tried to work with some word, excel and other business applications, but the resolution was not clear enough to be able to actually work.

I will not return it because the concept is beautifull and I am hoping that it will become better!","Oct 23, 2017 at 7:11 AM",3, 2,"You can try turning off the DX Injector in the settings. This should make your games playable.

Second time it performed well technically, but I'm only greeted by a screen saying ""Use hand controller to continue"" and have a tutorial to go through. 
The problem here is that non of the buttons on my controllers do anything whatsoever, except getting the menu. Nothing I do except for getting the menu has any effect at all.
If I could I'd refund this hard.","Sep 20, 2017 at 3:50 PM",1, 4,"Hi arkemiffo, we've got plenty of users who successfully enjoy VR Toolbox and we'd like to figure out what is going on with your system. Does the Touch controller show up at all? Does pressing in the analog stick perform any functions like bringing up the radial menu on the controller? Does navigating to radial menu options and pressing the analog stick select those functions?

2022-05-28 13:50:02.765125,Sharm1,Was good for a few minutes,"It's a nice tool, works easy, until you loose the desktop-screen (i probably clicked something). Tried uninstalling/reinstalling/removing all saved settings/rebooting multiple times, none of it worked. I've seen several people with the same problem but havent seen a solution yet (only downgrading NViDIA driver which is not an option).
so it's a great tool, just don't click away your desktop-page....:(

UPDATE: it works now. Didn't change anything after tons of tries, but a simple new setup (room setup) of the rift set everything back to default. Got my desktop-page back.","Aug 21, 2017 at 4:41 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 13:50:02.780085,pankajchandgupta,Good start,"Seems promising. Looking forward to future improvements. Biggest area lacking right now is builtin support for playing 3D video.

We understand that each HMD has different brightness outputs, and that the comfort level varies from user to user. Our team seems to be by the brightness of VR Toolbox in Vive and Rift HMDs, but if limiting the upper ranges on brightness is what you need to operate VR Toolbox comfortably, then we'll pass it along to the engineers as a feature to add."

In the end, I had some RFI interference from another component causing my issues. Once that was eliminated, I was able to fire the application up with no problems and it is working splendidly. It will be a while until I can take full advantage of the feature set because it had a LOT of features and configuration possibilities. The Developer was very nice and genuinely interested in getting it to work on my rather oddball hardware so I give extra props for that.","Sep 9, 2017 at 5:36 AM",5, 6,"Thanks, we appreciate it!"
2022-05-28 13:50:05.965643,Fantastic-Boy,it can be the best vr desktop app but..,"This is a good app but it needs alot of changes and improvments to be number 1..
1- it need it own video player not to count on vlc 
2- the main desktop screens cant be resized i dont know why .. so when they are far from your face they become to small to see (for watching movies on big screens feel)
3- when you are inside a room and you want to add a new screen .. where ever you point, the popup menu is to change the room settings not to add a screen or keybord (dont know if there is a way to go arround it)
4- its a desktop vr app so it need to count on the mouse a lil more than the touch controllers ..
5- ability to open each window in its own screen is a must have not only the broweser.. for example i want to have note++ and another coding software to be opened each on its own window not all of them on the same screen other wise why would i need the vr in the 1st place if i can do it better on my own screen","Jul 23, 2017 at 5:55 PM",4, 10,"Thanks for your review. Let me address some of your points:

2. Every screen or prop can be resized using the same mechanic - hold the trigger and then scale with the buttons.
3. You need to double click the joystick.
5. You can detach Notepad++ in its own screen, hold-click the joystick.

I do realize remembering the above might a bit hard at first. Suggestions for improvement are welcome!"
2022-05-28 13:50:05.982598,Antelino,"Cool idea and design, major issues",I like this app quite a bit and I would even recomend it if the biggest problem wasn't the fact that I can't use the mouse on my main windows screens. My touch controller has no problem clicking and navigating when spawning in a plain browser screen from the menu however when I spawn in my desktop screen my mouse is often just sitting there frozen and I haven't been able to get it to work at all. Once that is fixed this app is amazing.,"Aug 31, 2017 at 10:16 AM",2, 2,"Hi there Antelino! After reviewing this a bit, we recommend either pointing the controller away from the screen, or trying Ctrl+Shift+F5 to disengage the controller and engage the desktop mouse.

2022-05-28 13:50:09.092358,dirrtygmoney,Bigscreen on steroids,"Lots of stuff to love here.  Window management is easy to do and the controls are intuitive.  You can rotate desktops -- turning them upside down!  Zoom in, zoom out, adjust tilt and angle, and more.  The ability to add almost unlimited ""screens"" is an added bonus.  I'm not too big on adding backgrounds and scenery to your VR environment but the features are there.  The virtual keyboard works well.  There is a popup radial menu that gives you quick access to features.  There is even an FPS feature that add head tracking to your game.  Your view follows your head position!  I fired up an FPS and saw no performance drop.  Amazing stuff.  Get this one.  You won't be disappointed.

EDIT:  I emailed the dev to ask a question and got a personal response!  No automated fluff but an actual dev responded.  How cool is that?
