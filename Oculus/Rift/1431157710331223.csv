2022-05-28 18:10:08.197901,TOONNAMI,Oculus Quest 2 (Virtual Desktop),"has anyone got this to work with the Oculus Quest 2 with virtual desktop instead of using the Link cable? All my other games work, but not Voltron, for some reason it doesnt go into VR mode, it doesnt get past place your hands to start, i'll keep trying maybe theres something i've missed, or just purchase a link cable :)","Nov 18, 2020 at 5:53 AM",3, 6,

Next, I am ready to fight as Voltron and then... nope its over and I get to do nothing. Its was still fun till the ...","Sep 16, 2020 at 10:28 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:10:08.228819,mirakhe,You don't get to be voltron,"At the very end, voltron forms. But you don't get to do anything at all. He just kills the bad guy, and you read the credits. 
It's like the ending of a promising date, and then you find out they are married.","Aug 4, 2020 at 5:37 AM",1, 15,

2022-05-28 18:10:11.363435,unga_bunga_boogaloo,Great Game,"I really enjoyed it and it's great for fans of Voltron. I only wished it was a little longer, a little more interactive, and we got to do more things, like fight without the lions with our bayards. Overall, its really good and I would recommend it to fans of Voltron.","May 4, 2020 at 3:52 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:10:11.378395,T-Prime,Great game for fans of Voltron,"I'm a huge fan of the series. The DreamWorks Voltron series is probably my favourite exclusive animation series on Netflix. This game is basically an interactive episode. when it comes to the flying of the blue lion, it's basically like an old school rail shooter like Descent, except with limited movement control, but it's still really fun. The only thing I wish, is that they made into mor of a series, or a 3 part mini series or something like that. The game itself is less than an hour long, so I find myself wanting more. But I highly recommend it for any Voltron fans.","Jan 3, 2020 at 6:55 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:10:11.393355,Xalen_Maru,Childhood dream fulfilled,"I always wondered what it would be like to pilot a lion, to be a Paladin of Voltron.  Although it's not as long as I'd like, my dream is fulfilled.  If you're a fan of the original cartoon or the newer Dreamworks one, this game is a must have.  My only regret is it seems like we'll never get a chapter for each lion.","Sep 24, 2019 at 11:36 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 18:10:14.516003,j554er,the VR experience I've been waiting for!,"Yes! Yes! Yes! I want this for all the cartoons I watch. The ultimate fan experience. The only thing, and it's a small thing, is if somehow the player could have been encorporated into the story. Still, this was fantastic and I want every production company to make stuff like this. Wooooo!!!","Jun 20, 2018 at 10:15 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:10:14.530963,Tarbal,very short,"a nice one for kids or fans of voltron. 45 min to complete. Its more of an interactive cartoon than a full on game. between scenes, you get you shoot stuff or solve puzzles. 

As an interactive cartoon, it works very well. I've given it 3 star due to being very short.","Jul 31, 2018 at 4:47 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:10:14.545923,lilwolf,Kids only,"The experience is short, way too short...  And they missed SO much!  How can you have a voltron game with hand controls without letting you use your sword?!?!   Really for kids.  To bad, it's really pretty!  would love to see a full game.","Feb 3, 2018 at 11:27 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 18:10:14.561880,SUNofTITANS,Great Game!  (Although short),"I hope they continue making a series in this style in the future.  Not much to the game, but if you are a fan you will enjoy the ride.  Even if you are stuck playing as Lance most of the time.  XD","Feb 6, 2018 at 8:24 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:10:14.575843,Disruptionfl,Front row seat to Voltron - 10/10,"Excellent interactive cartoon. Less than an hour game play. Deal for current promotion price under $10. Possible new comics could be released like this and could charge  for each episode if they make it interactive or a season pass style. This is geared for the younger crowd but still fun for a middle aged person that grew up on Voltron, Thundercats, He-man, and GI Joe. Family will enjoy it once through. Not really replayable.","Dec 1, 2017 at 7:57 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:10:17.656603,Totius,Really for kids,"The experience is well made, the lenght is also appropriate for the cost, but I found it not very enjoyble for adults","Dec 12, 2017 at 2:50 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:10:17.672560,ajb1978,Revolutionary!,"This is what VR is about!  New immersive experiences that transcend traditional genres!  Some of us Gen X-ers may remember Captain Power from the 80's.  Toys that respond to flashing lights, so you could ""play along"" with the TV show.  In the loosest possible terms, this is what it reminds me of.  A TV show you watch, but also participate in.  The mechanics take a little while to get used to, and some of the puzzle games are mystifying at first because you're entering into them with little to no context.  But none of them were overly difficult, and all were quite solveable on my first pass through the game.  The flight controls of the Blue Lion are not intuitive, but again, the learning curve is very low.  (I'm honestly not sure if it's possible to die or not.)  This is a very great experience, a fantastic addition to the Voltron Netflix series, and I would really like to see a lot more of this in the future.  Movies and shows that take place all around you, and in which you play an active role; this needs to be the future of cinema.","Sep 27, 2017 at 9:26 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 18:10:17.687520,GreenSquid772,,"As a fan of the series I enjoyed this! The cinematic scenes are great, with high production values and well-done animation. It would be cool to see a longer game (maybe an anime-style RPG?) with the cutscenes done like this. There’s not much of a story, but the dialogue feels true to the show, and the voice actors do a great job as usual. Unfortunately the interactive parts could do with some improvement. The flight/combat scenes look impressive, but the controls are a bit clunky. The puzzles are fairly simple. The most annoying thing is that the other characters CONSTANTLY drop patronising “hints” and nag you about what you’re supposed to be doing. I understand how to solve the puzzle, guys – just give me a couple of seconds to get it done, okay? If any of the developers are reading this – I would definitely buy a second episode of ‘Voltron VR Chronicles’, but please include an option to switch off hints!","Oct 1, 2017 at 3:00 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:10:17.702480,ace3093,Very fun but short,The game is very fun and has some great visuals from the new cartoon. Only negative is that it is very short took less then an hour to complete.,"Nov 29, 2017 at 1:21 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 18:10:20.816152,bernhelm,An interactive Saturday morning cartoon,"Think about this like a 1-hr interactive Saturday morning cartoon, not a game, and you'll have a blast. The best cel-shaded characters I've seen in VR, alongside some simple but pretty elegant puzzles and a corridor flight control scheme that's fun to use!","Sep 29, 2017 at 12:58 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:10:20.832110,RukaziSintakumo,Amazing interactive Episode,"As a lover of the Netflix original series, I just love the detail and writing of this interactive episode. It feels like it is one of the actual episodes. Unfortunately it is a little short but I hope that Dreamworks will notice that the VR landscape needs more experiences like this and will make more episodes (if not a whole season like this). :)","Sep 27, 2017 at 5:01 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 18:10:20.846073,willo63,Lost all my progress,Bought game and played about 2hours. Then I had to stop playing right before the first robeast and when you form Voltron I assume. When I try to start the game and continue the game freezes and I can't close it without doing CTRL ALT DEL. I have to shut Oculus completely down. After trying to start the game several times I gave up. Now all that was left was to uninstall this game and write this review.,"Oct 15, 2017 at 5:17 AM",2, 1,

This is what will be the future, this is the way people want to interact with cinema through VR.... Please make more....and more like this.  I was entertained but felt it could have been more interactive, but very awesome for what it is.

2022-05-28 18:10:23.979691,rh_galaxy,Lack of control,"Ok story, good animations and sound. The puzzles have good controls but it is a not clear how to fire normal or charged shots (no immidiate response visible). I was finally able to take out the last guy after playing the scene for 15+ min, but afterwards I cannot say what buttons to press.
Changed from a negative 2 stars to 3 stars with the last update, with which I didn't have all the issues I mentioned before. But others really are to generous with the stars compared to the cost of this...","Nov 19, 2017 at 12:27 AM",3, 1,
