2022-05-28 16:18:02.247380,Nonebetter,Super fun - lots of ways to play,"This game is amazing. I have owned it forever, and the devs have added so much, its even better and it was already great before!
Multiple game modes, each super fun.

Lots of ways to build bases and expand, fight yourself or make an army, explore the alien planet and caves.
Graphics are good and fun, the VR integrated features are great

Would be even cooler with freemovement (they dont have this while I write the review that I know of)","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:24 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:18:02.261343,stefan.lovecchio,"surprisingly addictive, one of my favs","so far ive downloaded a lot of vr games, and typically i download things that both have good reviews, look interesting to me, and are things that i can demo to other people. 

the idea of a semi strategic space base building game doesn't REALLY appeal to me, though i thought maybe i could find it fun. i mostly bought it for the cute retro-futuristic trippy art style.

however once i started playing, i completely lost track of time and did not want to stop. i grew attached to my little bots, i wanted to figure out how to defeat the enemy base, etc. 

unfortunately the next day when i went to play this game again, i couldn't figure out how to load my previous game, and ended up overriding it with a new one by accident. This is my biggest pet peeve with these game - we need to be able to save multiple games. 

secondly - we need a roomscale mode. i understand that this type of game works best in a 180 set-up, but the black static is really annoying when i'm merely trying to turn around and orient myself in the world. 
with that said, for oculus users who don't have room for 360, this actually works quite well for re-orienting players. i just wish there were an option to turn it off (most users now use room-scale.)","Jun 25, 2018 at 5:16 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:18:02.275306,LanePizza,This is some pretty good gaming.,"Although I still haven't destroyed the enemy base once yet, it's still an enjoyable experiance. 

-Also; this game doesn't support 360 tracking, which gets really annoying at times when you're just trying to look behind you and a giant static wall is buzzing at you.","Dec 5, 2017 at 10:40 PM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 16:18:05.415906,NeoFaust,RTS in VR,"A very solid concept with building up bases, commanding troups and being right in the action. The usual minimap is a free zoomable 3d map which is kind of unique for an RTS. It only makes sense in VR. Instead of wandering around you are teleporting  from one base to another.
The only problem which I have is the lack of ""you are being attacked"" notification on the map. You hear a sound and see a marker in your virtual world but it's easy to miss them and hard to identify which base is under attack.","Jun 22, 2017 at 3:48 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:18:05.430866,MoleVR,Not a good Oculus Game,There's no in game hand model that you should implement in the Oculus Version of the game. Choose from buttons without seeing my finger to find a thing is too complicated. This is not Steam VR and Touch is not a stick like Vive wand. After your first few minutes you will realize its just another Vive amateur demo like thousands of demos thats on steam.,"May 24, 2017 at 3:27 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 16:18:05.444829,JCTrick,Worth the long wait!,1.0 just came out and this game will help set VR gameplay mechanics standards. They made all the right choices and this game just FEELS GOOD! Buy it. It's worth more than what they are charging anyway. It's a steal.,"May 25, 2017 at 3:49 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:18:05.458791,Mazzarin,,"An interesting idea for a game, but in its current state there's hardly any content, and it gets boring after a couple of minutes.","Mar 4, 2017 at 4:16 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 16:18:05.473751,Grillzy,"Great Concept, Little Content","The whole concept is really great, and the game runs really smooth, however there is very little content and you can't even go back to the main menu once in a mode I think the price is way too high for what content is currently there, and I brought it on sale........................................................................................................................................................................................The Oculus version is extremely outdated when compared to the steam version.","Dec 31, 2016 at 1:25 AM",3, 11,The versions should be in sync since exiting early access!
2022-05-28 16:18:08.563487,faetell,Fun!,"If you've ever played starcraft and wanted to ""step into"" a terran command center this may be worth checking out!

Basically you build drones to mine minerals and then build up defenses to fend off waves of enemies. The game content does seem a bit limited, but what is here is nicely polished. I especially liked the ""plugging"" your hands into the turret mechanic to light up an enemy wave - very satisfying. Seeing as this is still in development hopefully more content is coming soon!","Dec 30, 2016 at 5:03 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:18:08.577450,BlTEY,Don't be fooled its not an RTS,"I don't know how people can class this as a RTS. It's another wave shooter, and not really that good either. Very little to none content, you basically stand in one place and throw frisbee's at enemies, and build some robots. LAME... and at a ridiculous price to add insult to the injury.","Jan 1, 2017 at 9:56 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 16:18:08.592410,Nassire,Great Game,"This game has enormous potential. In its current state however, the game requires a little more versatility. With time it gets a little repetitive making bots and throwing discs.","Feb 12, 2017 at 5:59 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:18:08.607370,owenwp,,"Innovative and fun, with amazingly responsive animations and interactions that make unique use of the motion controls.","Dec 8, 2016 at 11:44 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 16:18:08.622330,kensai187,Fun concept for half an hour..,.. then it gets boring fast. In fact I think I played for less than half an hour.,"Jan 8, 2017 at 11:11 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 16:18:11.716055,profd78,Limited with good potential,This game even in its current limited capacity is quite a lot of fun and feels stable and polished.  With some proper RTS mechanics it could be great.,"Dec 30, 2016 at 10:16 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:18:11.730018,Justos,"stupid fun, even in early access","Unique RTS/VR game, really enjoyed the polish of this EA title. Looking forward to its development.","Dec 30, 2016 at 8:27 AM",5, 2,
