2022-05-28 19:45:56.624117,esanlon11,Trajectory Line Up!!,"First of all the que action is very accurate "" power  wise ""  But Lining up the shot is a bit of a nightmare while using the trajectory line  (a really fine line to get it right) I would like to see after the shot is lined up and kept the ability to adjust for que spin instead of the other way around.  Table wise the balls and pockets could be a bit smaller. ALso AI is way too good in easy mode. Would like to have the option to turn off music and sounds.,  gets really frustrating trying to line up a shot  with the repetitivness of  both. Lastly better movement around the table and remove the snap turn at the corners. I hope this is taken as constructive critism, because in my opinion nobody has done a better job in creating VR pool for playability, but still a long way to go. The reason  I gave it two stars was because of the price, otherwise it would have been one ( sorry ) I'm exited for the future of this game,  ( career mode, tournaments, realistic crowd reactions etc...) And I would be willing to pay a lot more for it.  Hopefully  this game takes off but it's looks like it's been around a while. Is their a future for this game?","Apr 3, 2020 at 7:09 PM",2, 3,"Thanks for your opinion, yes the final release of this game is comming probably by the end of the year, and will include also a second pool table with a different style, and more games, not just pool."

Nice game!","Jun 1, 2019 at 5:46 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:45:56.654036,WillardYT,It's Good but..,"The game is solid and its good for the price. However the bot is too accurate and makes the game less fun. The mechanics are great as well but lining up the ball can be super hard. I know this is a early access game, but some more people need to play it so you can play online. Overall Great game but please make these improvements.","Jan 28, 2019 at 9:01 AM",4, 4,
