2022-05-28 20:05:19.299512,Voighn,Awesome,"Even  my parents like to play. Been playing Shadowgate since NES.  Never fails to impress, you guys did very well. Hoping soon for book two!",Apr 28 at 7:37 AM,5, 1,"Thanks so much, Voighn! Super glad y'all are digging the game!"
2022-05-28 20:05:19.315468,Braxus,Absolutely incredible! A must have!,"This is my second review for this game. I actually bought it on Quest 2, so I got this version for free and left a 5 star review for it there too as it is very worth it. I felt the Rift version needed some attention, since it is even better looking than the Quest version, and recommend that one as well!

The Shadowgate series goes all the way back to the mid 1980s for those of you who didn't grow up during that era like I did. It was popular and well loved back then too. This is a game of the mind, and a bit of reaction to boot. Puzzles yes, and dying a lot as well, as that is par for the course with Shadowgate if you make the wrong move. 

Luckily you have a wonderful but sarcastic Raven that accompanies you on your journey, and will give you hints, and even after asking for more hints it will sometimes just flat out tell you the solution if you can't figure things out for yourself. Not to mention there are plenty of save spots along the way to help make things more fair.

I've beaten Shadowgate on the Quest 2 version, and didn't know about the Rift version that was released a couple of weeks ago. After trying it out, it is even more impressive, since the textures, shadows, and overall feel of the game is vastly improved. 

Another big shoutout to the original developer for making this a reality in virtual reality. This series has come along way since Shadowgate on the NES. PCVR needs it badly. I wonder if it will make it to Steam as well in the near future? 

I plan on playing the Rift version back through after having beaten the Quest version since this one looks even better. 

I definitely recommend this to anyone who is on the fence about trying it out. The mine cart rides are very fun as well. You won't be disappointed!",Dec 31 at 11:13 AM,5, 34,"Thanks for the love Braxus!

2022-05-28 20:05:19.332423,Quest787,Great!,"I played this first on Quest 2, which was a decent experience. This PC version elevates it to another level. It looks and plays like a AAA VR title.  Interactions with the world are incredibly satisfying and jank-free. The game world is dripping in atmosphere. There’s an excellent gradual hint system that keeps frustration at bay for those more into exploration and adventure rather than puzzling. I prefer snap turning, and it would be nice if there were an option to turn off the blink effect with each turn. But you do acclimatise to it. If you’re searching for a high-quality, well-thought-out title for PCVR, you’ve just found one.",Jan 15 at 8:10 PM,5, 7,Hey 787! Thanks for the great review! We appreciate it!
2022-05-28 20:05:19.347383,Wunderbear,Great game,I am really enjoying this game. Got stuck at one point but then realized it was my mistake. Graphics are great and the puzzles are fun. This is exactly what I was looking for in my VR library. Can't wait for further games in the series. Definitely worth picking up full price.,Feb 17 at 2:18 AM,5, 0,Thanks so much Wunder! Glad you're digging it!
2022-05-28 20:05:22.454180,rubbertoni,"Very nice Game, Savegames ?!","Very nice and interesting game.
You must have!!!
Very interesting tasks and beautiful graphics!
Many hours of fun guaranteed!
Now that Crossbuy also available for free in Rift account, great thing!

Developer:
Bought it on the quest and played it app 70%!
Then I had to reset my VR Quest glasses and all savegames are lost!
I find that very bad!
Now I have to start the game new and this time I'll do it with the Rift version so that my savegames are hopefully safer there!
If there is any idea how I get my old savegames back please let me know (had played it on Quest 2)

Normally I would have to give less stars for this, but the game is really good.

And actually I never feel like playing a game 2 times. That alone says how good I think it is ;-)",Jan 3 at 7:53 PM,5, 5,Thanks Rubber! I’ve spoken with our programmer about this. Can you send an email to contact@zojoi.com so we can chat? Thanks! Dave

If you answered YES, this is your game and the closest you can be of truly live that dream. LOVE THIS GAME!!! Thank you devs for create this vr masterpiece and make true this childhood dream of mine.",Mar 20 at 8:24 PM,5, 0,Thanks so much for the great review!!!
