2022-05-28 20:42:57.096398,Tumzz,Limited information,There is very limited information on the body systems does have a little bit on organs but if you looking to learn about the rest not much to work with for example I wanted to learn about the muscular system in vr but its just a brief description about the whole system doesn't break anything down doesn't show individual muscles or names of muscles or anything like that alot of potential but missing to much.,Jan 22 at 1:53 PM,1, 2,"Thank you for your feedback! We encourage you check out our latest update, which add entire modules dedicated to the muscular and skeletal systems. You can access these (and our full library of content) through the Home panel, and once you load the Muscle module you can use the Labels feature to reveal detailed descriptions about hundreds of individual muscles.
Sharecare YOU contains detailed medical information about thousands of anatomical structures, but from your review it sounds like you had a hard time locating it. Please take a closer look at the Label feature, and we think you'll be very happy with what you find. We appreciate your comment and will work to make the information even easier to find in each software update."

The visuals are top notch here and it helps educate the user as other Anatomy apps are geared towards classroom teaching requiring someone to lead the user through the experience. Hoping to continue to see more disease state and procedure animations in future updates.
Dec 2020
This is a Immersive Health and Wellness learning platform that use Anatomy to educate on a variety of conditions. The Anatomy info is good but basic. You get info on an organ and can show componets of a given organ but you get the name only for its subparts. Some like the Heart have great info on healthy organ and conditions and even treatments that affect it but most organs do not have this. Tried reaching out to Sharecare but getting no response to understand road map and if more is coming and when.","Mar 24, 2021 at 8:11 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 20:42:57.126318,mindleaving,Very detailed and great animations,"I enjoyed the first version (now ShareCare YOU 2017) and love the beautiful 3D models and animations. I now bought the pay-version to support the development as the first version already had great value for me. Of course it is also great to have all the new models. I use it for my anatomy-classes, especially neuroanatomy.

Pros:
- Amazingingly detailed models and animations
- Smooth controls, makes great work of the controllers
- Good choice of layers and cuts for showing inner parts of the organs.
- Movable info/settings panels

Suggestions/issues:
- Main menu: I don't seem to be able to move or hide the main menu which sits in the middle of the working area and is cluttering the view. Is there a way to move or hide it? If not, please implement that. Or even better...
- Panels: ...please bring back the wrist-attached panel from the first version. I loved the wrist-attached control panel in the first version. I always knew where to find the controls and buttons. Sure, sometimes I changed the view because I accidentally clicked on the panel when moving the view/organ, but that mistake was easy to revert. The free-floating windows work reasonably well, but having to move 2-3 windows around while walking throug/around the body/organ is annoying.
- Restore panels when switching body part: When opening a new body part the info panel shows up and panel positions have been reset and I need to spend a few seconds closing the unwanted panel and repositioning the other panels. Again: I would prefer the wrist-attached panel, but otherwise the panels positions need to be preserved when changing body part and the info panel must not re-opened.","Dec 6, 2020 at 8:25 AM",5, 9,These are great points and appreciate the feedback. We are working on implementing some of these ideas as features in an upcoming update.
2022-05-28 20:42:57.141278,Sakeeeee,"Amazing, although am I missing something","This software is unbelievable : gorgeous graphics, smart, usefull, incredibly interesting. It made me throw away my cigarettes pack ! Do you believe that ? So thank you, devs !
The only reason why I only rate it 4/5 is because we see more things in the video than we can actually see in the app : for example, it seems we can't see inside the brain like in the video. Or am I missing something ?

Thank you for your fantastic work, and thank you for your help.","Nov 11, 2020 at 5:05 PM",4, 23,"Hi Sakeeeee,
Thanks for your message and kind words! We are glad our software is helping you make healthy lifestyle decisions! In terms of the brain neurons scene you are referencing we are currently upgrading that scene and will definitely have it back in there for the next release. We hope that helps answer your question and hope you continue to enjoy the YOU Platform."
2022-05-28 20:42:57.157235,Cherie34,Doesn't work :(,This game doesn't work. I could deal with a few bugs but it actually is non- functional. You are not able to click on any of the body parts in the list. Your not able to see the insides of any body parts. I have the 2017 free version I love that one but wanted to have more detail for A and P class. Very disappointed it didn't work.,"Dec 9, 2020 at 5:37 AM",1, 1,"Hi Cherie34, thank you for your message and feedback on the YOU application.
