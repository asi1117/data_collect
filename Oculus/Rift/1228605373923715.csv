2022-05-28 19:39:47.409662,neuro27,Dribbling Challenge,"Mountain Dew and Spalding funded this short experience. You can start with a tutorial, which is a grainy 360 video with poor audio location (it sounds like everything is coming from the left corner even though The Professor is talking in front of you). The actual challenge is surprisingly well done. You watch how it's done, then you can perform it yourself. As I was going through, I could actually feel myself improving and getting into the flow of it. You can compete against yourself to try to do it faster, but that's about it. Worth trying out for the really well crafted basketball dribbling demo.","Jun 13, 2017 at 8:00 AM",5, 3,
