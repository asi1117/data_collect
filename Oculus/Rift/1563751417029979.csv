2022-05-28 18:09:08.868586,BoosieRNX,My most played VR Title easily 160+ hour,"I have 130+ VR games, and own this on occulus and steam, yes I paid for it twice... Games simple to learn you simply hop into arcade mode and destroy the targets by pulling the ball with the tractor beam, and timing the ball coming back and hitting it with your paddle. My favourite part of the game is twirling and slowing then ball essentially controlling it like to a very high degree almost magic... I had rated this game at 1 star because the devs had begun another project, and I feel don't really engage the public even in their own discord.. some recent updates have happened, their future planned updates also seem promising... So we will hold our breath and see. any questions, BoosieBC on twitch, death4unow2020 or cardtaker1984....","Aug 20, 2020 at 3:44 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:09:08.882549,HostileRabbitz,Alright,"Can tell this wasn't developed for the Rift. Developers likely made it for the Vive. As such, they should allow an option to modify where the racket is in the controller. The visual is all off by default. The handle on the racket doesn't align to the hand like a real tennis racket would. Simple fix if you could re-allign the controller like other games allow (i.e. Beat Saber or Boxer). Please add this funcitonality for Rift (I bet even people on Vive would appreciate the customization).","Jul 1, 2020 at 1:49 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 18:09:08.898506,Biggreenwagonwheel,This game is what VR is all about!,"Looking for something with replayability? Gameplay is responsive and tight. Sound effects are amazing. I can not stop playing. This is my favorite VR game. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.

Updated to say I do not have anything I would like to change about my review nearly 3 years later. Still an excellent game! I would like to mention that a feature has been added to easily connect with a friend by agreeing on a 3 digit number that both players use to match each other (cross platform or same platform).","Mar 10, 2020 at 2:23 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 18:09:08.913466,HSF,Its okay... but-,"I wish the developers knew how to do multiplayer better. The fact that I'm somewhat bad at the game doesn't help. So sometimes I angle correctly, but then the game throws the ball in the wrong direction because I hit with the wrong direction on the racket. 

However, the reason why I'm giving this a 4 star, is due to the cheaters in the game. Especially in the low ranks. I have no doubts about the high ranking players being so good at the time. They litterally practise 24/7. No, what I'm annoyed about is that the cheaters angle the same as me, and hit in the same direction and speed as me, yet they hit their target, dead on! And more to the point, actually, why do I end up in the same game with the same person every time I attempt to find a new person? 5 times in a row, I encounter the same cheater. This game has some serious anti-cheat problems. The fact that they SOMEHOW implmented an aimbot for this game scares me. What else can they do, aside from an aimbot? What happens when these low rank cheaters get to higher spots and lose against a pro player? I have stupid feeling this would be a repeat of what VRChat is trying to nail down protection against right now. They could actually pull some senstive data from the target by using RCE exploits in the game. Or even worse, destroy the opponents VR headset. 

If you're looking for a fun multiplayer experience with friends, sure. Go ahead. Strangers? Hell no. The game is fun, but I would not risk playing public multiplayer with these cheaters. Go and look somewhere else if you are into that kind of stuff. Otherwise, this game is pretty fun single player. And like everyone has been saying, good workout... if only you can get enough time play this. You can be going for quite a good while. ^^","Feb 5, 2020 at 4:59 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:09:12.029133,solidgames,Fun Arcade Workout,"I have tried a few racquet games and this one is by far both the most fun and the best workout. The aming is more fogiving and a bit more auto-aim than Holoball for example but the gameplay encourages you to swing hard and you definatly need to aim pretty well to clear each board. 

One thing that impressed me quit a bit was its ability to track your ""cord"" and let you know when you have rotated around.  Its very intuitive and keep you from having to exit the game to untangle. I wish more games had this feature. 

I played a few sessions and had more fun and broke a sweat after just one or two levels.  If you are looking for a truely fun, arcade experience with some skill required but ok with auto-assist aiming this is a great choce.  You will definatly be rewarded for well struck (good aim and power) but I did not notice ""spin"" shots as in hollowball but I just find this game more fun with more goals (not hitting some targets, hitting with power, and changing direction full 360. 

Another positive aspect is the game is full 360 and you will need some room to play. I would recomend raising the detection of the controlers to the play space to be sure you are not close to walls or furnature because you will be swing hard once you realize that is how to score.

I have not tried multi-player yet but I look forward to giving that a try but I was mostly looking for a ""get off the couch"" game that was tun enough to play on the regular. This is one of those games.   One thing I can think that would make it better is being able to play your own music tracks (update: Looks like this is possible!!! I will have to try this out.)","Nov 1, 2019 at 7:30 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:09:12.045090,neuro27,Almost 5 Stars; Almost Essential,"This app is definitely a lot of fun. It's VR meets tennis meets brick breaker, all in one cyberpunk arcade game. A few issues: I was about to put down the game because I felt my right hand was getting a work-out but my left hand felt abandoned at my side until I realized you can press trigger to switch to the left hand! Unfortunately, by pressing trigger, you call the ball to your racket, altering its path slightly. There's no way I can tell to just switch hands without altering the ball's trajectory. Also with Arcade mode, Classic does not show me my / global rank. I have to go to the main menu for that. I wish multiplayer had more people on it. I waited for 15 minutes, but luckily you can play solo while waiting. Finally, the ""announcement section"" last time updated was on release day July 2018... feels a little abandoned.","Oct 23, 2019 at 5:49 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:09:15.264479,MarcTaroHolmes,The spherical gameplay isn't great.,"IMO the design based on playing in a sphere is fundamentaly flawed. Could have been just as fun with the ability to rotate the stadium around the player. As it is, it's an invitation to disorentation, cord twising, and hitting the walls of your space. This game might be better on Quest if it comes out for that, but on cord-ed rift it is not a great experince.","Apr 13, 2019 at 10:11 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:09:18.382141,taquitobuddy,Pros and Cons,"This was a tough review.  First to pick between 3 or 4 stars (wish I could go 3.5) and then to pick recommended or not.  Here's some pros and cons:

Pros:
-Polished game with good visuals, great soundtrack, and solid VR implementation.
-Several game modes, including ranked multiplayer.
-Good dev that saw the project through.
-Anti-twist cable built-in feature is amazing, wish almost all VR games had this built-in

Cons:
-Multiplayer is dead (not the devs fault) and has a few issues, isn't as fun as single player because of the chaotic nature of the game.  Should have been tweaked to reduce that in MP.
-A few game mechanics that are not fun, eg. the Warp Holes suck all the fun out of the game, like constant mini-timeouts interrupting your game.
-Despite the increased immersion factor and VR feel, 360 doesn't add much to the actual gameplay and has its own frustrations, especially in MP.  I'd have liked a 180 mode
-In the end, got repetitive rather fast and lost the initial fun factor.  

In the end this is a very impressive and well-polished product from a single dev (I think) with some understandable but still weighty shortcomings.  If you like active VR games I'd recommend picking it up on sale for <$10.  I got a few hours of fun out of it, tried all the modes and multiplayer, but probably won't ever return for more.  Looking forward to this dev's next project though!","Feb 28, 2019 at 7:09 PM",4, 7,

After smashing my hands a couple of times on the wall, chair, son, etc. I actually spent lots of energy enlarging my play space just for this game. It is super polished and just a pleasure to play.

2022-05-28 18:09:18.428018,itschriscollins,Great arcade workout,"This game has a really great premise, like playing a 360 degree brick breaker with all sorts of cool powerups. There's plenty of single player levels to have a go at, with enough powerups and variety to keep you going for hours and hours, as well as fun multiplayer matches. It also looks fantastic, and has a really good feel. Perfect game to play a few round every day, and you can even work up a sweat!","Nov 12, 2018 at 6:58 AM",5, 2,

The devs seem pretty active and providing patches to make the game even better. Playing above the surface of the sun is a pretty nice addition. Almost lost my balance there.

There is also a cable indicator under your feet. It shows how many times you turned around and helps to get your headset cable sorted. It's a pretty unique feature.

It will probably be even more impressive on the Quest when playing free of all the cables.","Jul 10, 2019 at 3:20 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:09:21.521743,CroadNation,A must have for VR!!,"when i first played racket nx, it quickly became my personal favorite vr game, though i don't have very many. But as of the most recent update to the game (1.0.5) the game will crash before it even opens. the crash causes the display to freeze in the headset at the oculus loading menu (which is never fun) and the window on my desktop shows it's frozen at the first frame of the game. i could not find a solution to this online, and the steam version of the game gave me the same problem. I really do love this game, but until i can actually play it again, i can't recommend it

Update: the problem has been resolved, can't wait to hop back in and play!

i love the music and spatial audio as well. it's a simple concept but in my opinion it works really well. 

the only way i think it could be improved would be to add more environments, so you're not always in the default grey cube, being able to manually adjust the racket position before playing, & maybe being able to listen to your own music.","Jul 26, 2018 at 12:29 PM",5, 5,"Thanks for the review Stefan, great suggestions!

I gotta say the videos and screenshots do this game no justice and I only purchased based off the reviews on here and I'm glad I did.  For the price you absolutely cannot get better bang for your buck. Everything about this game feels good.  I especially like that it wasn't very easy to do well  at until you understand how to curve your shots and aim. Its challenging and FAIR.  It doesn't feel cheap and when you do well its because you played well and that is something that has been lacking from games these days.  No hand holding  and no catchup logic or second chances.  Make a bad shot and you are punished.  I appreciate that. I love the music and SFX too. I'm so glad to see a seemingly basic game like this go the extra mile with audio.
