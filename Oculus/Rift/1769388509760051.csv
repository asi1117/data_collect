2022-05-28 13:57:37.603462,Mithros,"Great game, though one problem","The game itself is great, worth playing for sure if you're a fan of the humor in Rick and Morty.  Often I'd just stand there and wait until all the extra funny dialogue was finished.  The only reason I'm giving this a 3 star instead of a 5 is that I recently got a Quest 2, and found that for some reason they expect me to buy the game again if I want to play it on the quest.  Literally the exact same game as far as I can tell, just double the price for upgrading my headset?  That's absurd.  If they fix the issue and make it so if you buy it on one you can use it on both I'd be happy to change my rating, because as I said, the game itself is great, I'm just not willing to pay double for it","Jun 4, 2021 at 3:25 AM",3, 61,
2022-05-28 13:57:37.617424,Jaqueob,A lot of fun,"I don’t like 3D platformers, do I wasn’t expecting To like the gameplay. I bought it for the Rick and morty humer. Surprisingly the gameplay is really fun, not to mention the game itself is hilarious. It’s great to just hear Justin Rolland babble off while you’re fighting clones. I would love if this game was in the first person (from trover’s perspective) but I see why they didn’t. It would’ve felt a lot more lonely, and a lot of it would not have worked. So if you’re a fan of Rick and morty, or you like Justin Roiland, get this","Jun 22, 2021 at 4:08 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:57:37.632384,Mathtias,A very funny and great game.,"A very funny game with a really polished combat system. I have two complaints though. The first is that it can be buggy on some occasions, like for example when I was fighting the final boss an enemy I had to kill got stuck in a wall and I was looking for him for probably 10 minutes. But it's not that big of an issue. The second complaint is that Trover. Just. Wont. Shut. Up. It's funny at first how he comments on everything that happens. But that's kinda the problem. He comment on EVERYTHING. Sometimes when I was doing a puzzle he would just keep babbling. Justin Roiland is REALLY funny and all, but keep it down a bit will ya?
But other than that, it's a great game. I definitely recommend buying it.","Apr 2, 2021 at 2:44 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 13:57:40.799052,Pan_Daemonium,So close,"When I started playing, I really wanted to be able to write a totally positive review for this game, because it started really, really well. It turned out though that there are a couple of serious gameplay issues, i.e. that games shouldn't be this annoying.

I'm not even talking about the humour, and the constant nagging and moaning from Trover - honestly, there were some laugh-out-loud moments in the dialogue and the plotting. But - and I probably should have expected it, given who made it - it's taken too far, to the point where it's ruined the game for me. I don't want to spoil it for others, but basically there's a point in the game (near the end!) where it lets you (even encourages you, given the general kill-happy ethos of the game) to klill someone, and if you do, you have to start *all over again*. I mean, ffs. I could even deal with the characters literally screaming in my ear as I'm trying to fight bad guys with one hand and hit a target with another  - I was even gonna play through it again afterwards to find all the secrets. Now I'm not sure I can be bothered even finishing it once, because honestly, the irritation factor in this game is high. If I do try again, it'll be with the dialogue volume turned down, so I can hear mysself think during the puzzles. It's pretty disappointing because it's totally unnecessary. Please try and make game-play decisions based on what's fun for the player, and not for the benefit of a developer who thinks it's funny to troll people and charge them for it.","Aug 13, 2020 at 5:25 AM",3, 7,

Fans of VR platformers will also likely enjoy this title as it has good production values and overall quality.  I didn't care for it myself however, as the gameplay felt boring and a bit frustrating in terms of controlling a character in 3rd person in VR.

This game is an absolute gem and I just can't get enough of it. If your reluctant to buy this game because its a platformer and not first person, do yourself a favor and buy the game. I thought it was a bit pricey at first but the game is incredibly polished, which is hard to come by for a VR game. Trover Saves the Universe is my favorite VR game and its pleasent to look at seeming to be in crystal clear HD even through my base Oculus CV1.

2022-05-28 13:57:59.757665,RuneSR2,Funniest game on the Rift?,"This game is totally awesome - had me laughing several times already, although I'm far from finishing the game. The humor is just perfect = super-sick black humor, Trover even called someone for mentally handicapped and has little to no restrictions on his vocabulary. Easily offended persons should never touch this game, for the rest of us it's a gem. And the game-play is extremely unique - I feel like the last Jedi, but also I'm in an adventure game, just perfect. This could be my favorite Rift game, but I need to play much more. I'm using an oc'ed GTX 1080 and I'm forcing super sampling 2.0 using Oculus Tray Tool. I've deactivated depth of field, all other video settings maxed out (=epic) including antialiasing. I got 45 fps, but it really feels like 90 (or close) thanks to asw 2.0 - and the game looks simply beautiful. 
BTW, initially I bought the SteamVR version, but got it refunded and got the Oculus version. The SteamVR version really let me down today - if I should have rated the game using the SteamVR version, I'd probably rate it 80 % (didn't feel smooth, like semi-glitchy, could easily see the 45 fps x 2 when running). But the Oculus version easily is 95 % to me, it's that good, feels like 90 fps. Or going to the Oculus version felt like upgrading my 1080 to a 2080 Ti, something like that... 
Touch works perfectly in the Oculus version. And everything just works better than SteamVR. When playing and then trying to change options, I got some weird loading screen in SteamVR (like being momentarily kicked out of the game) - but the options menu system is perfectly integrated in the Oculus version. When checking control options in the SteamVR version I got an image of an XBox controller - but Touch did work - in the Oculus version I got a nice image of my Touch controllers. Small details sometimes make great impressions...","Jun 6, 2019 at 5:00 AM",5, 102,

First of all, i was thinking a lot about writting this review, but as you can see i decided to do it. Why you ask yourself? 
Mhhh, i want you to not miss a vr gem, this game is worth the full price! 
But hear me out:

First of all, are you a Rick and Morthy  Fan? 
If so, dont even read further, just buy this game, even if there is no Disconter.

If you only like Rick and Morthy, and you want to know more about this game... than this review  is for you!
Even if you dont know the F### what Rick and Morthy is...
In this game, you are a Chairorpion, crazy ha? You dont move, you move Trover. This one is huge, if you playd Chronos, you know what i am talking about, BUT the huge difference is that you as the chairorpion, the NPCs interact with you a lot, even Trover does, he gets your best friend trust me.
The Design of NPCs and of the different worlds is GREAT, i personally love the theme this game has. 
You love strange humor? Great, this game will make you smile a looooot. 

But lets see the dark side of this game: 
There are NO BUGS litterly, ok bugs exist, but i ve not seen them, i played the game through, i collected everything, and never seen a bug at all. ( and i am a bughunter)
BUT this game has a lot of hash words, if you are a chode and take everything seriously, this game will make you leave.
but i think you are an alpha ;) so... dont care about the negative sides of this game at all...

So my last words/ verdict:
Its hilarous how great this game is made. you really see how much work the devs put into this game. They thought a lot about, how to make a great game.
So i know its 30$ BUT i think these 30$ are well worth it. 
it's better than Rick and Morthy VR i didnt like the game at all. 
But Trover, this game has a future, Free DLCs and a lot of updates.","Jul 5, 2019 at 8:35 PM",5, 3,

The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is well thought and the game won't cause motion sickness to anyone. It's immersive, super well animated and has an interesting yet comical story.

I was actually really surprised how could they pull this off, but later learned that the game can be played in a traditional 2D-mode too which explains it (bigger audience). That's all fine as it didn't feel like the game compromized anything. It's native VR alright.

Had a lot of fun with it, and the price isn't too bad for what you get.

Game is about 3-5 hours long, depending on if you wanna find all the green power babies. Free DLC is on the way.

Overall recommended purchase, even at full price.

GOOD:
- Very nice graphics, runs buttery smooth on 1070 with Rift S
- Hilarious dialogue - biggest selling point - don't get it if you don't like Rick and Morty
- Trippy worlds and environments that are very immersive

DECENT
- Combat is good but gets repetitive. New mechanics make it vary decently throughout the game.
- Platforming is good, but occasionally frustrating due to missed ledges

BAD
- Occasionnaly obtuse puzzles where I just missed what to do because the solution was at a weird camera angle
- Hands flat on your legs means poor tracking for rift s","Jun 28, 2019 at 7:49 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 13:58:09.219766,paladyr7,Really funny!,"If you like Rick and Morty, you'll certainly enjoy the humor in this game. The best part of the game is listening to the dialogue of all the characters by just sitting around and letting them talk. 

Also, I'm sooooooo glad I spent as much time as I did hunting down all the power babies because the reward was definitely not absolutely ridiculous and was totally worth all the effort and I'm so glad I did it and it was so fun going back playing the first level listening that that annoying little dude blather on while getting right in my face so I couldn't see anything... anyway...

Again, totally hilarious, glad I bought it, the battle of wills between me and the tub guy was epic... buy the game.

Also, can't wait to see what's in the free DLC!

FWIW I played with the touch controllers and it was fine!","Jun 14, 2019 at 12:10 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 13:58:12.312690,Gudnistark,Awesome. but...,"This game is awesome, but there are glitches, the sound just goes from my headset to the speakers or goes out completely and then comes back to the headset. But the game is fun. And hearing those voices is awesome. Just a Rick and Morty miniverse, love it. But the chear might have more freedom.","Jun 11, 2019 at 10:03 PM",5, 0,
