2022-05-28 20:21:41.362461,ArthAnsgar,Fantastic Proof of Concept,"This is my take on this game, it seems that most reviewers agree with my rating, but YMMV.

If you are looking for a challenging—but not impossible—shooter, then this is a good pick. Keep in mind, however, that this is a demo or proof-of-concept, not a full game. Devs have stated more times than I care to count that they are currently looking for a publisher. In it's current state, it is a wave shooter, which basically means you are stationary fending off waves of enemies, though developer comments hint at some sort of movement mechanic if/when they build the full game.

The highlight for me is the gun mechanics. With the revolver, you can manually operate the hammer and spin the cylinder, with all (3) reloadable weapons, you have to manually extract the spend casings (by dumping them out with the revolver, pulling out by hand with shotgun & flare gun), load the rounds one at a time, and manually close the chamber (either with inertia or by pushing it shut by hand). The only major thing I would like to see that they missed is the ability to use the revolvers ejector to remove spent casings while keeping unfired ammo, instead of just dumping everything on the ground (information on how that works can be readily found on the web, if anyone is unsure).

This demo certainly shows potential. I have no doubt that a full game would be able to compete with AAA VR titles (few though they may be), provided the devs are able to find a publisher.",Mar 20 at 11:11 AM,5, 12,"Thanks for the great and considered review! I'd totally agree with pretty much everything you've said above! :)

A couple of people have commented on use of the ejector rod, maybe we should put that back in? We only took it out in testing as too many people play testing didn'tseem to know what it was for!

We are looking for a publisher for a full version of the game, and do indeed have a version up our sleeve with movement! 

In the meantime - really glad you enjoyed our demo, hopefully we'll be back with more!"

2022-05-28 20:21:41.408338,EscapingShikari,Very cool demo. Would love more!,Everything about this game is very fun and unique but one of the things to catch my eye was the shockingly realistic handling of the weapons. You can manually pull back the hammer ahead of time on the revolver for a shorter trigger press and you can even decock it if you wish. It's very rare to see vr games with realistic gun mechanics and the ability to use them in the same ways a real firearm could be used so it's super refreshing and awesome to see it used in such a creatively unique game.,Feb 28 at 2:13 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:21:41.423299,Monkeyboy06,Absolutely brilliant. Full stop.,"I don't write reviews normally. This is in fact my first for a VR game on the store, however this game has pushed me to provide one as it would be criminal not to! It's terrific, I haven't had this much fun in ages in VR! Pour lots of bullets on to the rock in front of you, then frantically try to reload your gun but keep calm and not fumble when you're under attack by the creatures. It's refreshingly addictive!

For a demo, they absolutely nailed it. I wouldn't even hesitate to buy the full game if it came out. 5 out of 5, good effort!",Jan 24 at 8:15 AM,5, 10,"Thanks, we really appreciate you taking the time to play our game and review. It’s particularly cool to hear that to caused you to write your first review on the store! We’re glad you’re enjoying Eastern Edge, we’re hoping to be able to be back with a full game in based on Gabe’s story in the near future."

I play vr and I live it professionally (I work in tech for a major electronics manufacturer) and I'm impressed with the creativity of this wave shooter experience. usually you hear ""wave shooter"" and you might as well toss the game into the trash/bin. But this one really finds a way to be unique. So well done!
DEVS: Please find a way to bring us a full game. You can have my money! :)

EDIT: DEVS I know an established publisher who I'd love to intro the game to. I'll get in touch with you.",Jan 12 at 9:03 PM,5, 9,"Hey, thanks for your great review and time playing. We’re in the process of trying to secure a publisher for Eastern Edge. We’re really pleased that people seem to be getting what we’re aiming to do with the gameplay and balance of the demo! We definitely have plans to move it beyond the current crashsite location and the static shooter genre to see Gabe roaming out into a wider story, and taking him on a journey through the perils of New Guinea wilderness. If we secure funding, we’ll definitely be back with a full game. Stay with us and spread the word!"

We’re only a small indie team, so it’s awesome to feel like people really get what we were trying to do with the gameplay - we poured a lot of love and hidden depth into it! Keep playing - completing the demo the first time unlocks the sawn-off shotgun and explosives - and that weapon balance makes for a totally different experience!!"

The one other issue is that when i was reloading the revolver, the tracking rings on my controllers would colide, making it even harder to reload than it already is. keep up the good work!",Dec 13 at 10:21 AM,4, 12,"Glad your liking it - we’ve decided to make Eastern Edge free so that the maximum number of players can enjoy it! 

Here’s a ammo management tip - pour lots of spare revolver shells on rock in front of you - like at least several boxes! Then only empty spent shells from your gun on to floor at your feet. That way you always know where to reach for a reload and never have spent shells mixed in with fresh ammo! 

Accidentally chambering spent shells (or even just trying to sort them from the live ammo pile in a clutch) will pretty much guarantee that you become bug food! Enjoy!!"
2022-05-28 20:21:47.766531,D_K,Solid,"EDIT: See Developers response for a nice solution to the reloading ""ring bumping"" when using Quest 2, thanks for the suggestion Luke, looking forward to more of your work.

This was free so I really cant complain, its well enough presented and the manual reloading is a nice touch, I look forward to a full fledged game, perhaps an open world would be out of the question and take too long to develop, but maybe think along the lines of ""Time Crisis"" with more linear paths you move along point to point.  Its has a few flaws, I found that you tend to bash your controllers together when loading bullets and that often the barrel on the pistol would not ""whip"" back into place no matter how much I waggled, I also had the same problem with the shotgun.  Still recommended for a short and sweet playthrough",Feb 2 at 10:49 PM,4, 0,"Hey DK, thanks for playing our game and sharing your feedback. I’m guessing you’re maybe playing on a Quest via Quest-link? The game plays really well on Quest link but there are a few small differences between the systems. 

The Quest’s constellation rings are slightly differently placed to the original Rift’s. So if you bring your hands together fast you might get controller clack because of that ring position. Easiest way to avoid it is to roll your wrist over 45° on Quest during reload, to bring the revolver cylinder up to 12 o’clock and keep the rings clear of each other. 

The revolver and shotgun both definitely have ‘wrist-flick to close’ built-in too, but there maybe something different in the way the Quest’s IMU (inclinometer) feeds back a flick motion over Q-link, so we’ll look into this too. 

We’re actually seeing way more Quest-link players than we anticipated, so we’ll look into whether we can maybe sense this in-game and adjust both these aspects slightly for you guys in a future patch. In the meantime, hope you continue to enjoy! Luke"
2022-05-28 20:21:47.781491,tttlov,WOW! Very nice!,"I really like how it is build, but loading shells one by one is killing me, way slower than in reality. Maybe add shell cartriges, which would needs to be load as well in a ""free"" time, gun would be loading way faster, however keep both ways.

Interested to see the rest go the game, I went searching for info on buying a ""full version"" and found nothing. no mention of anything, no screenshots passed the second chapter. The game is only about 10 minutes long with the current content. Is this game going to be finished? Was it abandoned?",Jan 23 at 10:33 PM,2, 1,"Hey Oldskoolzeldafan, it’s very much not an abandoned game!! It’s a 2 level free demo that we made to see if we could find a publisher for a full game. Our aim was to prove that a small indie team could make something high quality in the VR space. We’ve been blown away by the support of the community around the project so far. There’s 1-2 hours content for most players in this version if you play through the shotgun & explosives unlock mode too. Definitely try that - it plays totally different to the pistol run!"

I don't really like the setting. The gameplay is a bit too stressful for me. It lacks depth.

The graphics are stunning, the shooting is great, the reload is cool and what made it replayable was the mode you unlock once you beat all the missons where  you get a double barrel shotgun, grenades, a flare gun instead of normal flares and what I think are panzer somethings. How interactive and visually stunning it is makes it so great and fun to play. It's literally free and takes up like 2 GB which isn't that bad.

2022-05-28 20:21:54.095304,bloxxer02 ,Not for most players,Insanely hard,Feb 12 at 1:44 AM,2, 1,"Difficulty in games is a really hard thing to judge - one player’s easy is another player’s frustratingly difficult! The game is pitched to provide a challenge, but we are seeing lots of players complete the demo and survive til dawn. A lot of mainstream shooters are set to be pretty easy these days, so we’re aiming to give you a proper fight to stay alive!

EE rewards staying calm - it’s all about a well-timed tactical reload. Here’s a few useful tips in case you want to try again. Go on - master these and you’ll be splattering bugs in no time! 😀

1. Pour lots of spare revolver shells on rock in front of you - like at least several boxes! Then only empty spent shells from your gun on to floor at your feet. That way you always know where to reach for a reload and never have spent shells mixed in with fresh ammo! 
2. Accidentally chambering spent shells (or even just trying to sort them from the live ammo pile in a clutch) will pretty much guarantee that you become bug food! Enjoy!!
3. Always reload all 6 chambers between encounters - even if you only shoot 1-2 bullets. You don’t want to be facing more than 1 bug with a half-loaded gun. 
4. Keep calm and aim for head and centre mass - this does more damage.
5. You can sometimes scare bugs off by hitting them when they think they are hidden."

My Initial Impressions:
This game has a superb looking environment, interesting plot lines and credible mechanics.

2022-05-28 20:22:03.507005,FelicityC,revisit: 2021,"edit 4:  If the devs feel like they would want to add some 'value', although I have fun getting mad at the quest 1's shoddy tracking for reloads, perhaps an endurance mode more akin to starship troopers. a LOT of bugs. mayb one-shot since the rng hp is a bit annoying. I could almost see a re-release if that angle was taken and, though it would hurt the thematic nature, it would increase the value a good deal

Still greatly appreciate the chats I had with the devs. I hope all is going well. COVID hit all of us at the moment we were just about to make our way. 

the game is short if you are quick to pick up tricky game design. there is not a lot to it, but what there is has a, though somewhat unsaid except in tooltips, degree of mastery available that didn't take very long either, but I expect perhaps others might be able to end up spending more time on it if they try and beat their records- once I did, and found ways to challenge myself both by the dev's records and just wanting to go faster myself and see how well I could optimize it, I had enough fun doing all that to cement these 4 stars from my 2 stars previously. 

criticisms that still remain, and that i want in the review, despite them being explained to me already: no ejector rod for reloading, enemy vectors are rather limited, enemies are limited, gun projectile physics are, while consistent, unrealistic for the caliber, but that unrealistic element adds some quick mafs you must do to hit specific shots. 

Enjoy the short story, enjoy the immersion and the very tense night section, but don't expect an epic. I look forward to everything this dev will bring in the future, because this, although I will word it perhaps criminally incorrectly, proof of concept, is the best I've seen in a long while. 

Try and beat these records.

80.07% accuracy in a full playthru.  135 shots fired.  93.90m furthest hit. 15.99m average hit. 4.33s* fastest reload time. 12:11:58 speedrun time.","Jan 17, 2021 at 8:07 AM",5, 9,"Hey Felicity

Thanks for taking the time to play our game, reviewing us and your emails. Your stats are first-class - you shoot really well!


Difficulty in games is a really hard thing to judge. One player’s easy is another player’s frustratingly difficult!  I think we may have pitched this a little easy for you by the look of it! Most players so far have only gotten through 50% of the game in <2 hours. So short / long is relative to that skill level. Maybe we need look at difficulty modes to stretch better players more?

It’s a good point about the cylinder extractor rod – we had it in the game in Beta, but we took it out as most players didn’t figured out how to use it in testing - they just tipped the shells out. We might put it back in in a future build if people want it. 

I’ve also seen your Youtube clips -  they're awesome, we really hoped that some players would explore the easter eggs and deeper mechanics that we put into the game - thanks for sharing these! The 2 pistol run is fantastic - I can't do that as well as you do in that clip.

Your stats are the ones to beat! Only TheSAINT is close to your numbers currently. We'll definitely keep in touch and make you a tester. We’re not an EA or an Ubisoft (we’re just a little 3 man team building this in our spare time) so we don’t have the resources of a big outfit - good testers are always really useful! Thanks for your time and support - Luke"

2022-05-28 20:22:03.537922,thecuriouspixel,Fun and intense!,"This is one of my favorite VR games so far. It is one of those ""challenging but fair"" experiences with a healthy dose of tension! I'm not proud of it, but I had to put the controllers down a few times. The game mechanics are solid, simple and realistic, so you can act as if you were really there! ( you don't walk around, but there is plenty to reach all around you )

The game has a friendly progression system. I can only play in small increments ( work and children ) and it lets me do just that. Once you unlock a story point, you can jump to the next one, or start from any previous point. This means there is little to redo if you have to interrupt your game ... unless you want to. You can also hone your skills with a previous level, if you find the next one too hard.

The game is quite replay-able. I find myself returning often to experiment with different ways to set myself up for success. There is also a treat when you beat it.

I'm playing on an Oculus quest via link and had zero issues. The game loads fast and is very responsive.

Your’e INSANELY good at our game - like top 1% of 9000+ runs globally good!! Most people don’t get to where you are in less than 2+ hours.
