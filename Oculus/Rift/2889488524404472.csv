It starts off like a real museum with a lobby and several rooms to walk through. Since its in VR, you can pick up the artifacts. It is fun to get to throw them around, or just look at them closer. This part of the museum also has real artwork on the wall which is very high quality if you stand close to it. Then you can teleport to a medieval village, which looks like is still being developed. There are informational signs everywhere throughout the experience, they all appear to be historically accurate. One of the rooms if full of very high quality artifacts, the sign says they were made with photogrammetry. Some other artifacts appear to be standard objects. It’s clear that it’s an early access title, but it is virtually bug free and very playable, which seems rare for early access games. I look forward to updates. I wish there were more historical experiences on Oculus.","Mar 28, 2020 at 12:51 AM",5, 11,Thank you for your review! An update for the village map is being actively developed. There are also plans to replace many of the current artifacts with photogrammetry and higher quality models.

Notes to developers:
-The controls took a minute to figure out, especially how to change visual orientation. Can there please be a way to snap rotate (maybe using joysticks?)
-I might have missed if there was a tutorial on controls, but if a wrist menu or sign was created when you enter..it would make the new user experience better","Apr 3, 2020 at 12:24 AM",5, 4,"Thank you, DreamerO, for your review and feedback. We will be adding a sign showing the controls in the next update.
Edit: An update has been released adding a sign for controls."
