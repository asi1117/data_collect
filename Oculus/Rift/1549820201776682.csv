2022-05-28 18:34:06.345887,smaurine82,This is so Cute!,"My 9 year old son and I already have a real house filled with cats, but this game is stinkin' adorable! He said it's his new favorite game. It's easy to figure out how to care for the kittens and it's entertaining for me to watch him struggling to get the kittens to poop where they should and him cleaning stains out of the carpet. He said, ""Now I know how you feel mom!"" Music to my ears! And yet when such gross things are simulated, they are more fun than in real life (for whatever reason).","Oct 6, 2019 at 12:42 AM",5, 5,"Thank you so much for the review! 
This made my day! <3"
2022-05-28 18:34:06.368825,pavilionweb,Great Game but now My Room doesn't work,"My daughters enjoyed the game but then the 'My Room' Freeplay mode stopped working and crashes every time, so I uninstalled and reinstalled but it didn't fix it, I went to get a refund and the Policy is if you have played it for more than 2 hours then its not permitted, not happy as it did work fine the first time we played.","Sep 24, 2019 at 2:12 AM",2, 3,"I'm so sorry! We are aware of a issue with My Room at the moment and we have a patch coming up that will sort it out! :(

Update:
OK patch is being reviewed by oculus at the moment!"
2022-05-28 18:34:09.489479,lokeedgren,CATS!,This game has the most cutest cats in video game history. And it's very realistic (i guess the space spart isn't that realistic but who cares). And i kinda was wake the whole night playing this game becuase its hard but cute and fun at the same time.,"Jun 26, 2019 at 5:45 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:34:09.505436,MrE.Nigma,Very fun and silly game!,"Only picked this game up because my 4yr old is addicted to cats and she's not quite old eniugh for a real one.    I was very pleasantly suprised.  The kitten models look great, the sounds are there.  Its funny and silly in just the right ways. Its also easy enough for my daughter to play a bit, but still more amusing to me than I expected.  Very unique and original game, great job.","Feb 25, 2019 at 5:21 AM",5, 7,"Thank you so much this made our day!
Have a great day!"
2022-05-28 18:34:09.519399,Gongre,Need help (fixed),"I can't get the game to start in VR mode, even though that is the only option. Instead it starts in desktop mode every time. In the headset is the generic loading screen.

Update: While other games worked and this did not, it was Oculus software that needed updating. Works now. Cute game for my 7 year old.","Dec 17, 2018 at 9:52 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:34:09.549319,Dropla,Fun little game!,"I had a fun time, it really does kind of keel like you're holding kittens! They seem to react to your petting, etc. I am bewildered about the other review stating they didn't know what do do, it was litereally spelled out in text. You are in a room with kittens, kittens eat and poop and want love, you pick them up and pet them and snuggle them, use tools to scoop poops, refill litter and fill bowls so they can keep stuffing their lil kitter bellies. Once you pass a level you go to another level with new kittens, sometimes more kittens who will be up to mischief (you also have to keep them from breaking room items lol good luck) 

I wish that theree were a little bit of boundries, I tried to kind of cuddle both kittens together and they kind of just go right through eachother lol, this didn't stop me from snuggling and being happy about their reactions! I also wish there was a zone I could go to and just play with the kittens from the levels I have completed. Sometimes the go go go of each level leaves me wanting to have a minute to enjoy them, for like a long time lol. Maybe this is something that unlocks or I haven't found? I dunno, I just wanna cuddle and put the little hats and glasses on them haha 

 Either way, the 3 star review saying it's hard to understand? I ""litter""ally took the headset off, put it on my daughter and she was able to seemlessly play without much direction...I was just like, make sure to clean and refill litter and food bowls...and she got it lol","Oct 13, 2018 at 12:22 AM",4, 13,"Hi there!
Big thanks for the feedback. <3

There is actually a zone where you can just chill with the kittens. If you press the menu button and go to ""my room"" that is exactly what you are looking for!
You not finding this is great feedback to us however just means we must make that a lot clearer.

In my room kitten needs moves a LOT slower, but it also moves when you aren't there so if you check in on your kittens in a day or two you will need to do some cleaning and some SERIOUS cuddling.

Again big thanks this is really helpful!"
2022-05-28 18:34:12.656010,Giyazik,I love it!,"In love we the VR kittens!
Looks great framerate is ok could be better.
Easy to learn with two different modes.
I played most my room. Upgrading the room is really fun I have 4 kittens now.","Feb 19, 2019 at 4:52 PM",5, 2,Thank you!
2022-05-28 18:34:12.671967,VR2018FR,,"what the heck am I supposed to do in that room ? I put food where I was supposed to, put litter in that litter box and...that's it, i'm in an empty room I can open and close windows, open an empty fridge, start the oven, open and close a closet and...nothing else I cannot adopt a cat cause it says I have to complete level 1  But what Am I supposed to do , ? OK ! Just click on play on the  bottom right instead of the level one icon or the game will never start...","Jul 11, 2018 at 9:43 PM",3, 19,"Update: This change has now rolled out in version 0.45.0 thanks again.

Big thanks for pointing this out!
Next patch will make it so that you can't press the ""MyRoom"" without first finishing the tutorial and we will make the button for ""play"" more.. obvious. <3"
