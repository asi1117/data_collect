2022-05-28 19:29:40.306246,degradingpine47,Pretty Bad.,"For the 15 seconds I was in the game it seemed small, not much to do and not much to look at. It seemed that it would entertain me for about 15 minutes before i'd get bored. After 15 seconds the game crashed. I thought that i could just reboot the game but error messeges keppt showing up.","Aug 7, 2019 at 11:04 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 19:29:40.322203,JorTron2,Good Potential,Was a fun and FREE little game. I see good potential with it and hope it keeps going I think will get very popular. I know this is very lame but first thing i did was grab a beer and try to drink it. Should add effects and sound like PokerstarsVR or Drunkn Bar Fight. I am going to be sure to keep a eye on this one looks to be great game.,"Jul 10, 2019 at 8:56 AM",4, 8,Thank you for your words JorTron2. We will keep working and hope to improve some of those things soon.

2022-05-28 19:29:43.481753,Marasmusine,,"A nice place to chill out for 15 minutes. You can throw some dice, play chess, shoot bottles, throw darts. My only gripes are that the friction on the pool table is too high, and I didn't seem to be able to throw small things (like darts and chess pieces) as far as I expected.","Jul 3, 2019 at 6:21 AM",4, 5,Thanks for your feedback.
