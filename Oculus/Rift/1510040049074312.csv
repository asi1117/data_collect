Part of the fun of a real coaster is getting tossed around like a rag doll in your seat as it jerks and bucks around the track, trying to throw you out. The first coaster is set in the dark with techno music and rave style lighting. At one point I could even feel the light on my face, it was that convincing. The ride itself is fun, long and like a real coaster.
The second is set outside, has a country feel to the music, and decapitates you at one point. I’m guessing that is on purpose? But if you like coasters like the jack rabbit that tend to hop and jerk, you will love these. And yes, there are smooth parts as well, so something for everyone.","Mar 24, 2018 at 3:46 AM",5, 2,"Thank you for this comment, and yes you are suppose to move your head if you dont wanna loose it in the desert, that was made in purpose :) glad the effect worked ;)"

Worst attempt at a coaster I've tried yet.","Mar 7, 2018 at 10:32 AM",1, 8,"All the motions are fully realistic, this is the main point of this app, just get in a real coaster to compare."
