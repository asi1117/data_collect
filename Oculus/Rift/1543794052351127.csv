2022-05-28 18:04:25.677022,melonasun,Looks beautiful,"I'm not generally a fan of VR experiences that aren't games, but the visuals compliment the song incredibly well, and it's great for showing VR off to people who might not have much mobility. The knives are a small bonus, though it'd be nice if they stayed in your hands until you let go instead of just popping out of existence after a certain length of time. In any case, I would love to see more free apps with this style.","May 21, 2019 at 11:42 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 18:04:28.900401,QTCrafter,10/5 Just Watch It,"This music video is a psychedelic blast through a neon-laced void. Remember the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey? Imagine cruising through that black hole in a tricked-out convertible with sick EDM beats and scenery to match. Except you don't need to imagine it, because you can download this app and do it. I started out sitting on my butt because I was tired, but this had me on my feet before the music even started, and put a stupid smile on my face in under ten seconds. It's free. It's short. (It's a music video.) It's goddam immersive. (Try headbanging a little.) Just play the goddam music. Goddam son.","Feb 2, 2019 at 9:25 AM",5, 4,

I even sugest it if you dont like these types just because the music goes perfectly with the graphics! I have played it so much and it never gets old.

The song is catchy and I really like the art. Knives fall all around you which you can interact with. Just know there is a demon chick who appears above, below, and next to you. She is naked but a drawing so.... it's all good right lol! You decide, her picture is right there on the cover so if you don't want to see more of her then don't get this one.","Feb 3, 2018 at 11:14 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:04:35.245430,rooitou,Demonic and boring,"Don't know how age restriction on this is only 3+ as it has blatant demonic depictions. Nothing much to do besides grabbing virtual knives with your hand and drawing lines with your fingers, while demonic pictures flash around you on the beat of a loud song. At least it is free, but I still want it out of my library.","Jan 18, 2018 at 4:56 PM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 18:04:38.372067,FastLawyer,Sword is easy to grab in standing room,"Don't listen to the troll review, you can easily grab the sword in standing room only or seated.  But you really want to stand for this one to see all the amazing stuff around you.  This is one of the absolute best music video VR experiences and it's free.  You can grab swords, draw, and grab the stick shift.  There's also some other things I don't want to spoil that you effect.  I loved the music and the visuals were top notch and creative.  We need more of this in VR.","Dec 15, 2017 at 11:25 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:04:38.386030,nickladd,Very Stylish,"I do a lot of art in VR so I love seeing stuff made with Tiltbrush. This was a cool, short music video, if not a little bit repetetive after a while, could have used a few more assets.

Couple of odd requests: Wish the knife was turned 90 degrees. Seemed like a very strange way to hold it. Also wish the drawings you could make with your hands trailed behind you while the stage was in movement. It was a bit jarring to have them float with me while the stage was in motion.","Dec 15, 2017 at 7:34 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:04:41.554556,DexteroExplosion,Easy five stars.,"This was a new experience. I feel pretty often that I've seen most everything, but this blew my mind. An interactive, artistic, VR music video. With that description, I still wasn't prepared for it. I stood there for the first half with the biggest grin on my face. If someone had walked in, I guarantee they would have had some questions. It was like being in some kind of 80's movie drug fueled fever dream. Of all the different non-game experiences in VR that I hope I get more content for, music videos just jumped to the top of the list.","Dec 18, 2017 at 11:27 AM",5, 2,

I do have 2 requests: Remove the need to use Touch to start it. Can we just look at the dagger? I hate wasting the battery. Also, the second round of text has some bad aliasing making it hard to read. Can we have a high quality setting to max the anti aliasing?","Dec 19, 2017 at 5:20 AM",5, 0,
