You move your stone by laying down tiles that create paths.  Sometimes your tile can affect other players who are forced to move.  When a player's stone is led off the side of the board, they are eliminated.  The last stone (or stones) left wins the game.

The presentation here is really fun.  You're in a japanese garden.  There are little touches like bees that fly from flower to flower as well as birds.  

Movement is via teleportation, similar to Robo Recall where you can choose which way you want to face before moving.  

There are game modes and special features you can unlock as you accumulate games, reach specific goals (like play an X player game).  There is also online play, but nobody was on when I tried.

The great thing about this game is that you can finish a game within 15 minutes.  The more players, the faster the game goes, but the more interaction you see between the players pieces on the board.

I highly recommend this.  It's polished, games go quick and the price is right.","Jun 5, 2019 at 9:20 AM",5, 11,"Thanks for the in-depth review, Hanover!

I also really like the environment, it gives me that relaxing chill vibe. Great and quick game. The AI is also not too hard or too easy.","Jul 3, 2019 at 5:18 PM",5, 4,Thanks for the rad review!
