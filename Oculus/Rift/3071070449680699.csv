Minor quibbles in some design and execution overshadowed by particularly exceptional, cohesive design and execution of a focused concept & story. 

I could give this four or five stars and both would be true to my feelings, so I chose to lean into the 5 stars.

I certainly recommend pleXus. It is thought provoking, engaging, immersive. From the beginning to end I felt enveloped in the world it creates, existing there for my time in the game. I feel the last act is slightly undercooked but not to a degree that it took me out of things. I had an issue in the second act where I got confused, not realizing that a switch was a switch, and aimlessly trying to sort out a puzzle I had already solved. 

But these are minor matters. There is a lot to love about this one hour story & puzzle-solving adventure.

It is unique, focused, thoughtful, memorable, and wonderfully VR. Buy it!","Oct 12, 2020 at 12:15 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 20:31:14.455283,OrionInHades,"This is not a ""comfortable"" game.","I love the game, I love the puzzles, and the graphics are really good. I just wish developers would understand that any time you have a walking motion in a game it causes problems for people suseptible to motion sickness. Teleportation is the answer to this. Please, give folks like me the option to teleport verses walking. As it stands I can't play this game for more that fifteen minutes at a time.","Nov 14, 2020 at 10:16 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:31:14.470243,EvilJFloyd,Got a minute?,"Besides being kinda preachy, like listening to someone trying to get you to join their religeon, it is insultingly short. Even on-sale it is not worth the cost. This feels like a demo its over so quick.","Dec 26, 2020 at 4:07 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:31:14.486200,ilpio.pita,Thought provoking,"I stumbled upon this game on accident, and I am happy I did! This game draws you in from the very first moment and the way the 'world building' takes life in front of you it's something I hadn't seen before in VR.

pleXus is a diamond in the rough. The graphics are highly detailed but in the last chapter a little bit more polishing would help. But still, that takes almost nothing away from the whole experience. The sounds look proffesionally made overall, but in 2 moments they literally gave me chills.

It is not a very long game, but definitily it is not short for the price. It is the right length to build up the story and enjoy the journey even though you have to pay a lot of attention to grab the full idea behind this thought provoking story.

I definitely would reccomend it and would suggest to every player to be attentful to the middle story scenes. If you play it, you would understand why. Give this gem a chance!","Oct 21, 2020 at 3:58 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:31:14.501160,Isilius,A must have in your library,This is one of the best VR games I have played in a long time. It starts off in a nice slow pace and it culminates in a mindblowing finale. Certainly didn't expect that...,"Oct 9, 2020 at 5:10 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 20:31:17.614444,harakat,A solid game,"Overall I loved the experience! I am giving it 4 stars because it is rather short. It took me slightly less than 3 hours to complete.

The story build up and the details tto the graphics are amazing. The music choice game me chills in many occasions. I am being very very picky by giving it 4 stars.",Apr 10 at 5:15 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:31:17.630401,krisvdvijver,"nice, short light-puzzle game","It’s not bad, it’s quite good, but also quite short and not all levels/stages in the game have the same quality. Wanted to give 3.5 starts, but it seems I can’t give half a star in the Oculus app.","Oct 19, 2020 at 1:22 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:31:17.645361,Darcangel777,Challenging,"I love puzzle games and have solved many . Am really enjoying the graphics and the challenges of this one. Highly recommend. DO miss having menu options for movement, height adjustment etc but otherwise great","Oct 27, 2020 at 4:14 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:31:17.661318,PrnKiss,Amazing game,"I am impressed in a positive way. Loved it!
The final plot twist was... Just play it!","Oct 9, 2020 at 5:55 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:31:17.677276,Krists04,Beyond the immediate,Once someone taught me that what is essential is invisible to the eye! And this game recalled me that. One has to play it to understand what I mean. Loved it to bits!,"Oct 10, 2020 at 5:14 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:31:20.783389,jessica_houghVRgamer,Simply brilliant,"I have played many VR games, but guys this was my favourite one!! It is full of challenges and makes you think outside of the box to unravel the story. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience an engaging and interesting story.","Oct 9, 2020 at 6:28 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 20:31:20.799347,suzana.dalliu.9,A must for your VR library,"My favourite VR game. Easy to play, but solving all pieces of the puzzle it was really challenging.","Nov 1, 2020 at 1:21 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 20:31:20.814307,verrguy,Great game,"This game is incredible when it comes to creating an atmosphere. Amazing music and graphics and I was fully immersed in it. I hope games like this one became more and more common.

I loved all the chapters but the final one really left a mark on me. It was the simplest in design but the heaviest one story-wise.

All in all, an amazing game and quite cheap for its quality.","Oct 18, 2020 at 12:59 AM",5, 1,
