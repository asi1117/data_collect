2022-05-28 19:53:25.067283,tovanbo,Atmospheric roomscale game,"There are too few games out there that explore roomscale free locomotion (no teleporting or joystick walking). There is something about walking around an environment with your own feet that makes the experience so much more immersive, and Host's atmospheric environment and level design really make great use of this mechanic.
It's a bit short, and sometimes you have to think twice about how to advance, but if you have a roomscale set up I highly recommend trying this game out!","Apr 4, 2020 at 11:18 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:53:25.083241,MadeinBrooklynGames,A Trippy Thriller Journey,"Host makes me feel like I am taking a horror-inspired Magic School Bus journey inside a Lovecraftian creature. The exploration reminds me of going through McDonald's play places of the past with a sinister twist. I love the way space was used in the game for travel, it felt like I was traveling yards inside of the twisted insides of this world when I was only walking in loops around my play space!
This game would be amazing on the Quest, without having to stay tethered while exploring!
I would recommend this game to all of my friends who like Adult Swim and escape rooms!
5 Stars on Uber!","Apr 5, 2020 at 5:56 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:53:25.098201,heartthrob2000,Strange and Beautiful,"This game is a great example of the possibilities of VR.  It hides so much that it practically begs you to crawl around to really explore and find new things.  Great game, could not recommend more 11/10","Apr 5, 2020 at 1:18 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:53:25.114158,Zarbomba,Unique atmosphere!,"The creepy sound, the organic rooms, the unsettling atmosphere, everything in this game is something i've never seen in a game. I'm curious to see the final game!
(And ignore the 1-star rating down below, this game is a roomscale game, so you have to move yourself in real life to move your VR-character. The person who rated that bad, did't payed attention to the description. You need a play area about 2x3meters probaply)","Oct 4, 2019 at 8:16 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:53:25.128121,gtufaro,Unique experience- want to see more,"There are definitely some unique thoughts going on in this experience... the way roomscale is being used to manipulate a small space and allow somebody to travel distance is something the author should go even further in exploring. I didnt get far but, would like to see more than just green orbs and purple tunnels... does it go much furthet than that?","Jan 19, 2019 at 9:43 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 19:53:28.250422,Silent_Assassin,No way to move?,"Not sure what I'm doing here.  I load the game and am instantly outside of what appears to be crashed spaceship.  I can see my hands.  There is a strange door that looks like an orifice in front of me, and pressing a green nodule seems to open/close said door.  However, I can't move.  I can't walk through it, I can't teleport.  Until someone can explain how the heck I'm supposed to do anything, then I can't recommend this to anyone.","Jan 1, 2019 at 6:10 AM",1, 3,Hey! Sorry you're having issues. It seems like you're on the right track though! HOST is room scale game and I intentionally didn't add teleportation as you're supposed to walk around and explore. The minimum size of your play area should be 2m x 3m though. Walking through the door should've brought you into the next space. What happened when you did that?
2022-05-28 19:53:28.266380,Jose_Zambrano,Coolest alien thing in this planet,"Love the idea behind, and the art too. Very few games take advantage of roomscale VR and physcially walking around the environment, this defenatly takes immersion up a notch. I won't through spoilers out, but its worth it, one puzzle took me a bit to figure out, but it was very rewarding getting through.","Mar 10, 2019 at 10:03 AM",5, 5,
