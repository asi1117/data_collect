2022-05-28 19:27:27.360828,Cotivity,Viral,"A simple but effective way to experience motion in VR...It plays identically to it's Gear VR version.

An on-rails title that again, is a decent time-waster and something to bring out for those new to VR.","Dec 27, 2019 at 11:35 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:27:27.407702,VibrationsOfDoom,Remembered my first VR game... fondly.,"Back when I first got into VR, I bought a ""headset: you slide your cell phone into. Interesting, but waaaay primitive compared to the immersion factor of the Rift. And this was one of the very first games I played. Looks and sounds gorgeous. Still, the speeds and the sudden loops twists and turns tends to make me a tad dizzy for a few. It's kinda like a racer game, but the backgrounds are worth looking at. Drive fast, hit the green ""speed up"" things, avoid anything red and capture the white icons when you see them. It's a good fixed track game. Haven't delved very far into it but I do enjoy it when I pick it up. There's some story about delivering proteins to the nucleus or some such craziness, but overall it's a speed rail driver game.","May 9, 2019 at 11:21 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:30.528356,rh_galaxy,A good game,"I'm ok with the helping voice, others are not. But I missed that the green things are speed boosters and have been avoiding them, which made me fail the 1st level... the green and white is good, red is bad, got it now.","Apr 21, 2018 at 1:10 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:27:30.544313,nightcat.mau,A Blast To Play,"I agree with the review that said this game is a lot like a roller coaster. Only you control this one with head movements or your game pad. I went with game pad and I'm half way through the game so far. I want to strangle the annoying bot who ""helps"" us, but who doesn't? Amazing graphics and it's fun to spiral around the track.","Mar 26, 2018 at 10:49 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:30.559273,HeyJesseAe,Average,"The main character's voice is incredibly grating. However, think of it as your basic audio surf experience. All controls rely on head motion.","Jan 21, 2018 at 10:51 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:27:30.574233,NeoGenesisMax,Well Made,Seems to be very well put together.  Worth checking out.  This is the first of two games that have made me feel sick.  It went away quick but if you're sensitive to that kind of thing you should avoid this.,"Aug 1, 2017 at 9:38 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:27:30.589193,ghewgley,Solid,I have played this game on both the Gear VR and Rift systems and this is a great deal for entry-level VR. The graphics are amazing but the game does get to be the same after a short period of time. This is a great game to get started in VR.,"Jul 29, 2017 at 12:42 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:33.680924,neuro27,Poor Man's Radial G,It's as much as you could ask for in a free game. Story is a powerpoint with text-to-speech narration that introduces you to the scientifically illiterate world of InCell. Deliver a vaccine to the nucleus? That's not how that works. 100 trillion cells infected in a mild case of influenza? Not even close. 2134 is the year where microsurgery begins? Try 1921. Just ignore its attempts at biology and appreciate the mediocre gameplay and pretty scenery.,"Jun 29, 2017 at 2:20 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:33.698875,OoaliceoO,Very Nice Fun Racer,"If you liked Radial-G you will love that one. Seems to be bit easier too, and the best thing, it's free. Most other free games do not come with Audio, Graphics and Gameplay fitting together like that.
I found it way easier using touch controllers than moving your head to avoid the obstacles.","May 15, 2017 at 5:37 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 19:27:33.747745,Greyhawk101,Really good idea for a game,I thought this was really well done and the fact you dont even need a controller is great. Might be worth expanding on it. I can imagine some players may suffer some motion sickness but I was ok.,"Feb 2, 2017 at 8:36 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:27:36.856430,Alejandro8888,Not Working,"Played the game once and it was great, it now glitches everytime I hover over any map (Organelle). Tried deleting and re installing several times. I am now downloading it on Steam.","Jan 12, 2017 at 3:11 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:36.873385,DecimusInfinity,Freaking Awesome,Im waiting on my touch controllers and playing this in the meantime and its definitely awesome! I will be supporting the developer via their site bc InMind was good but this was even better; its got me all excited to write this review and anticipating upcoming content and hopefully touch controller support!,"Dec 2, 2016 at 2:46 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:36.889343,cybernettr,,"Not an accurate representation of the inner workings of a cell, but the colorful graphics are fun nevertheless. Unfortunately, gameplay becomes a little repetitive after awhile, and no matter how much I play, I never seem to make any further progress. Can't complain about the price, though.","Nov 4, 2016 at 2:26 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:27:36.906297,jon,Aged,"This was an enjoyable, stand-out game back on the DK2, but suffers today from being grossly simplistic compared to other offerings on Oculus Home.  Appropriately described as a repetitive rail racer with little depth, there are many other games where your time and money are better spent at this point.","Oct 30, 2016 at 6:02 AM",2, 0,
