2022-05-28 17:30:53.874357,plwells42,Hours of fun,"The concept of launching paper airplanes at targets may seem simple and potentially boring, but this game is far from simple or boring. You will spend hours traveling around the beautifully created world and face some rather challenging tasks.  Each type of paper plane has it's own unique attributes that make it ideal for some targets and not so ideal for others.  You will eventually find yourself spending some time just seeing how far you can make a plane travel before it either hits something, disappears out of sight or comes back to you.  I highly recommend this game.","Mar 20, 2021 at 6:47 PM",5, 1,

It's zen, the art style, sound, and music are all enjoyable, and I don't ever find myself wishing the game was easier or harder. The tracking on throws for power and direction are generally pretty good, but on the times that it wasn't, it isn't a big deal - there are always more planes to throw, each with their own special ""abilities"". It's just fun to toss 'em around, and there's plenty of content, enough to play for maybe 5 - 8 hours if you go quickly.

I have one major complaint - I did a level, but noticed that one completion indicator wasn't lit. I had missed one of the bonus objectives. No big deal, I went and did 3 more levels before I went back to it so it didn't feel repetitive. The problem was, once I exited the level, the other levels I had already unlocked were no longer accessible. It was as if I hadn't done them at all. I would now have to go replay all of those levels to get back to where I was. I restarted the game the following day and despite the completion indicator being accurate at around 70%, I still couldn't progress past levels I had already done without doing them again. I would really appreciate a fix for that.","Jan 11, 2020 at 1:44 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:30:53.920234,Iblysi,Fun Game!,"It's a fun game. The game has some nice areas or better yet it is one big world where you move from location to location. There is no movement other then you teleporting from one spot to the next via your teleportation plane. The music and the sound effects are nice as well, and for those things it could be a zen like expierence. There is also a story weaved into it. i'll let you expierence it for yourself, but you can just shoot paper planes at things and ignore it. So overall it is a short but fun expierence. Though there is one things that annoyed me. Why do the paper planes fly away from you all the time? Having to wait for them to come back while you just want to throw them is annoying, and happens far to frequent. Other than that its a fun game that should keep you busy for 3+ hours.

PS: Would love to see some achievements being added, so we can hang those in our home space.","Apr 22, 2018 at 7:38 PM",4, 20,
