You should be aware of some things however: There's no tutorial, which may make you lost at beginning (I had to find an youtube guide - once you figure out that the towers are at the right and how you place them, it's fine though, except that you need to figure out some details about the towers yourself). You definetely should have enough space in front of you to play it as you must stretch with your hands far or move some around to reach the whole field. It's impossible to play this game sitting. And last thing, the hands (controllers) look horrible... if you get used to these things, you'll be fine. I've to play some more to see how it scales with the next levels and if it stays interesting.","Apr 24, 2018 at 3:48 AM",4, 1,
