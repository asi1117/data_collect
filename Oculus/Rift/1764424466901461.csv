2022-05-28 18:31:43.596690,neuoc,Games great cus of carl :),"I loved surviving on the island and catching fish making fires growing coconuts but my favorite part of the game was carl, carl never failed to get me to chuckle and at some points keep rambling on. Ive seen reveiws about glitches but they most likely be fixed. This game is loads of fun would recomend","Dec 9, 2019 at 6:12 AM",5, 38,
2022-05-28 18:31:43.611650,Healthyalluc,Rioutly fun,"Nice comedy and lots to do, the game keeps you on your toes, intresting strategies that varie for different players.
Idea: You can craft rafts to travel to other islands with your crab?","Dec 17, 2019 at 12:27 PM",5, 30,

2022-05-28 18:31:46.740282,RuneSR2,The most crabby game in the Store! ;-),"I did buy this one for the kids, but I'm not that sure they're able to really play it - at least it's great fun for adults too. Well, if you can cope with tons of crab that is. I've tried it for about 45 minutes, and it's like Groundhog Day - a really crabby Groundhog Day. You just have to survive and time sure does go fast. 
There're nearly no reviews in the Store, so initially I thought this game would be too crabby - and it sort of is - but in a good way.
I feel I've already been exposed to tons of crab today - but I'm ready for some more, never though I'd enjoy crab so much! And it's Unreal Engine 4, perfect Touch controls (ok, you cannot hold the crab, but you can hold, manipulate and eat most other things - maybe it's a good thing you can't eat a lot of crab in the game, I wonder if that would have been against Facebook policy, nevermind). I do believe that $7 is the perfect price for this game, especially thinking about the amount of crab you're getting exposed to. Note this really is an adventure game - if you don't learn to do things the right way rather quickly, you die (and start all over = Groundhog Day). It's an advantage with a large play space, you can recenter using Dash - there're no in-game settings. Game runs great using high levels of super sampling, and the game should run great on low-spec hardware. But most important - this annoyingly crabby game is a lot of fun to play - in small potions :-)","Nov 30, 2018 at 6:50 AM",5, 24,

Island Time sees you stranded on a tiny island. The gameplay involves trying to survive for as long as possible, using the limited resources you have on the island, and the advice of your buddy Carl the crab. You are motionless in the environment so there is no locomotion present, but you can play the game seated, or standing to experience room-scale on the tiny island should you wish to.  Craft tools, scare off threats such as seagulls, and most importantly, you must find nourishment to maintain your health, which you can monitor on your wrist watch. Or you could just give up, enjoy your surroundings, and accept your fate? The game is designed so that you will die repeatedly, so the game can become quite addictive if you have a competitive personality and are determined to increase your survival time. It would be great to see a global scoreboard added to the game for more replay-ability. Overall, a fun game, that is colourfully animated, and Carl the crab is present with sublime voice acting, to provide comedic commentary throughout your stay on the island.","Apr 6, 2018 at 8:22 AM",4, 28,

My Thoughts:
A fun survival game based on a very small desert island, you will need your wits to stay alive.
Cute graphics and a lovable crab companion make this a very cool puzzle experience. Not sure how long it is yet!
