2022-05-28 20:02:33.108259,Diamante556,Too simple to be enjoyable,"It is exactly what it shows on the page. There's no catch or new obstacles to keep you on your toes, it's just making a hoop not touch a line. It might work as a time-killing mobile game to whip out when you're bored, but as a VR game, don't bother. I'd say only children would find enjoyment in it, but even children would get bored by it.

Only positives I can give are it functions properly, and the fact it's free means you won't be wasting anything but time on it.",Apr 11 at 6:57 AM,2, 0,

2022-05-28 20:02:33.157128,boysrule0909,Nothing Bad,"Nothing bad about the game, it's simply just guiding a hoop with your controller without touching a line. It's free as well!",Mar 2 at 1:02 PM,5, 3,

2022-05-28 20:02:36.302354,서율,great!,"It's fun, but it's amazing that vr has already become popular enough for individuals, not companies, to make such simple games with vr.

재미는 물론이고, 벌써 전문 기업이 아닌 개인이 VR로 게임을 만들 정도로 VR이 대중화되었다는 것에 놀라울 뿐이다.",Mar 29 at 11:56 AM,5, 1,
