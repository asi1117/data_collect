2022-05-28 17:11:03.009494,bwana4swahili,Limited,Very limited tour of body.  Should be called The Cell!,"Mar 15, 2021 at 6:11 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 17:11:03.026448,Oldmancrazy,"Dense, pretty dense.","This was pretty awesome but the drawbacks are there.  You start off in the bloodstream and it tells you about the white cells, red cells and 2 others.  Then it shrinks down and you go into a tear in the vein wall and thats when I started to not follow what they were talking about because it got dense.  There is a lot of biology and terms and explainations of what things *do* but thats a bit to the fault of this thing because I had questions.

I love this thing, I think its an amazing tool for this kind of thing but the two things I did not like where that i didn't feel any perspective was given into more general information on how these fit into the whole.  The other thing was the developers had to make a choice to make this world and they had to use graphical representations of the things themselves...  Like cell walls and things that look like candy sticks.  I think they did a good job with what they had but it also didn't feel ""real"" if you follow but for like a less than 500meg download, its pretty freaking amazing and worth the trip.

I do love this and what they did here.","Aug 9, 2020 at 8:14 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 17:11:03.056371,Zathereth,It is ok,"I was hoping for more.. well... everything. A lot of the textures were pretty bad, like two generations ago kind of bad. Things were clipping through each other, like the molecules clipping through the pumps leading into the cell. There was really not enough information on anything, you basically got the name of each thing you saw and an extremely basic description. There was only one pump. it did not describe any of the other types such as the sodium-ion gated channel. I think the previous sentence describes the entire experience. You went through this macrophage and the only thing described briefly were the Nucleus and Mitochondria. The virus attack simply phased right through the cell. Although this was very poorly done, I still appreciate it and believe that VR is the future to learning. Things are much easier to learn when you are actually there instead of trying to create an image in your head.","Dec 7, 2018 at 5:48 AM",3, 17,

2022-05-28 17:11:06.194974,jeff.xu.7,New Education System,"This is the future of education, but this game is a bit lackluster in graphics. Still this is a glimpse into the future of education & for that I give it a 4 star","Jul 6, 2018 at 3:03 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 17:11:06.209933,FastLawyer,VR Educational Microscopic Experience,"You go inside the human body, specifically inside the vascular system and inside blood, cells, and other related organisms.  There are no explosions, no gun fights, no rollercoaster simulations, no gameplay mechanics.  There's no drama, no plot, no character development.  Because it's all about the science and  a peek into the human body.  My only criticism is that certain concepts are introduced, but not explained.  For example, the term ""protein synthesis"" is used to describe some of the functions but never defined.  DNA is defined, but never explained in detail.  This experience kind of assumes you are already familiar with many of these concepts and just want a VR microscopic view of these systems.  It's a great aid to be used alongside a teaching tool, but not great as a teaching tool itself.  It's a missed opportunity to teach people some basic, but not widely known by a majority of adults, concepts in biology.","Jan 1, 2018 at 9:52 AM",4, 15,

2022-05-28 17:11:09.366491,zimmund,Cool but not ready for VR,"It's interesting to see, but it's more of a 360° 3D experience than a VR experience. The camera jumps abruptly and you can't interact with anything, it's just a long 3D documentary. It's pretty and interesting! But not a good VR experience.","Nov 4, 2017 at 12:21 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 17:11:09.381451,IncRaz,Tech-demo type documentary,The possibilities are definitely there but excecution is lackluster. It's still easy to see that this is a great format for a documentary but the graphics and uneventfulness makes it fall short.,"Nov 17, 2017 at 5:12 PM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 17:11:09.410374,corad96,Major letdown,"It's a really cool idea, and I found the facts very interesting; however, the mechanics are nausiating. The transitions between movements are very sharp: first heading full speed towards a cell wall, and then stopping completely just before hitting it is not a good feeling. 

As for the ""Story"", all the chapters seem to lead into each other, but the last one feels like a very abrupt ending.","Aug 27, 2017 at 12:49 PM",2, 1,

It's made exciting through the use of narrative (especially the part about viruses), although I would appreciate more interactivity.
