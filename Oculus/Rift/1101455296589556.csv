2022-05-28 15:34:32.799155,MeliodasTheToadus,EPIC GAME! but...,"I love this game, I love building worlds and exploring more features. I just wish the terrain it self was more developed, life being able to make a volcano erupt or cause earthquakes or other features. I also would love there to be more control over the humans like changing the diplomacy or war.",Aug 24 at 9:11 AM,5, 15,"You will probably love what will come this year ;)
PS : You should try the flame button on the volcano"
