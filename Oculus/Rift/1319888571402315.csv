2022-05-28 19:22:51.964414,JellyCoatedBean,Added to my must have VR titles,"Awesome game. So cheap for what you get. I really hope this gets updated, though I like it as is tbh, I just want more. Controls are good once I got used to them. Only certain bits gave me motion sickness, unlike other games like this which I get really sick from. Learning and remembering the spells, then figuring out where to use them was amazing. If you like puzzles, feeling like a real wizard and saving the world without any kind of combat. This is defintitely worth getting.","Jun 10, 2020 at 8:09 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:22:51.979374,theregoes2,Wow! Wasn't Expecting That,"tl;dr: I expected to not like it, but I like it probably more than I should.

This made me feel like I was inside an old style RPG. It's a simple game with easy payoffs that are close enough together that you might find yourself up late because you just want to do one more thing. 

It has it's problems for sure, but they are the problems you should expect from a game that only costs $11.99 CAN. The graphics aren't great, but they are good enough to feel like an oldschool experience. There were a few times when I got lost in a maze, but only for a few minutes. It was kind of frustrating, but again, it was that sort of oldschool frustration where you can't find something and then the elation when you finally do. 

The best part so far was when I learned a few spells and then learned I could combine them. I haven't finished the game yet and I don't know how many spells there are, but I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with that. 

What I really want is for this game to be given a bigger budget and the time to be made into a proper adventuring game, rather than a really cool play mechanic with a basic story to propel you to use it. 

Movement isn't amazing, but it's serviceable. I have played worse. Grabbing and spinning the world felt strange at first but by the end of my play time it felt like second nature. 

I do want to say that, despite the fairly crude graphics, there was a moment of intense presence for me the first time I saw the castle. I don't know what it is about it, but it just sucked me right in for a few seconds and is actually the thing that made me feel I had to write this review. I can't say it will be like that for everyone.

I went into this expecting very little. In fact, I felt pretty sure I was either going to hate it, or like it enough to play only once. Perhaps that helped a lot with how I felt about it. But I will be coming back to it soon.","Nov 30, 2018 at 1:51 PM",4, 13,
2022-05-28 19:22:51.993337,Doodlebugz32,Good Puzzler,"Cons:
The controls made me a bit sick at the very begining since it felt like turning should have been opposite, or at least had the option to change it, once I got the hang of it there were no more sickness issues. (I don't recommend free walking in this game at all.) The ending was more than a little bit of a let down. And finally there were some bugs, specifically with the sky rune, whatever it was called. (The floating one). I learned to cast it, wait for the bug to finish putting me in the floor, then moving on once it reset to normal, if you cancel it before the bug finishes you can get stuck in the floor.

Pros:
The price was great for what it was. The game itself is awesome, I spent a good 2 days trying to find everything and get 100% completion, once I got the hang of the game I was addicted. The puzzles aren't too hard or too easy. The graphics are decent enough for a puzzle game. Having to memorize the spells and actually put the effort into casting them was very enjoyable for me. 
I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys walking around solving puzzles. 

FYI there are no enemies to kill in this game and nothing attacks you, (not sure if that was mentioned anywhere already).","Dec 31, 2018 at 11:40 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 19:22:52.008297,pigtripper,"Fun, Relaxing Little Adventure!","I've only played this for about 1/2 hour at this point, but it looks like a fun little adventure game.  The spell casting system is fun, making rune shapes with your constantly equipped wand and then casting them at things.  The music is very well done, but some of the tunes do tend to get a little redundant.  The sound effects were also very well done, from the rusty creaking gates to the ""puff"" of smoke sound of the tutorial scrolls.  The graphics are, as you would expect, a little cartoony, but they fit the game perfectly.  My biggest complain is with the locomotion, which is somewhat configurable, but the rotation is with the grip button and causes some motion-induced discomfort, which took a little while to get used to.  Not sure why the option to use the thumbstick flip for turning wasn't an option.  There are a LOT of options to set graphics and movement and sound as well.  Overall, I think this is going to be a relaxing and fun experience (for many hours!!) if the first 1/2 hour of play is any indication.","Nov 12, 2017 at 9:25 AM",4, 9,
