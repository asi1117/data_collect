2022-05-28 20:29:22.238956,JoCandia,Its good,"I played this several months ago and did not like the game.  I revisited the game just this weekend and its SO much better now. It plays very well, the graphics are better and i cant think of a better way to play disc golf when its in the single digits outside.  The game mechanics work well. I wish this was on the Quest natively.",Jan 15 at 1:24 PM,4, 2,"Thanks for the review! Glad you're liking it.

Bugs are annoying. I walk when i'm not trying to and I kept sinking into the ground.
Game has potential to be very good if bugs are fixed and improved gameplay","Jun 25, 2021 at 7:58 AM",3, 9,"Hi! Thanks for the review.

2022-05-28 20:29:22.268876,MONSTERMINDED,This is BAD!,I play Disc Golf and this is nothing like it. The disc do not shoot right or feel natural when you play. The enviroments are just ugly. the physics are off and this is not worth 20.00 dollars. This feels lazy and like some cash grab. REFUND!,Jul 20 at 12:12 PM,1, 3,"We're sorry you didn't like the game.
