Thought it would be a cool way to work through more complicated tricks at a slower speed. Playing this it was like learning how to juggle all over again. It took me about almost an hour to just to get 3 balls going, something I normally don't even have to think about.  At 50% gravity it seemed to work a little better but still tricky. The problem with the gravity is as you lower it the throws become more sensitive to small wrist movements. So you have to throw with very little motion and it is easy for the balls to go really high. Once they go so high it is nearly impossible for them to land near you. In some ways I think slowing down time might be better. Keeps the balls from going as high but still give time to react. If you really want to learn how to juggle go watch TaylorTries on youtube. 

A couple other improvements I think could make it easier to learn would be to expand the catch radius around the hands. This will compensate for the lack of extra peripheral vision from the headset. Having to wear a headset the balls leave your peripheral vision sooner than they would in real life making it harder to catch and also many times when I thought I caught a ball I would just see it bounce off the hand.  A nice training feature would be to only allow the balls to be thrown in 2 dimensions. This would prevent the ball from being thrown forward or backwards and make catching easier.","Mar 7, 2021 at 2:39 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 19:43:44.863721,BishopsGambit,Not really useful,"I installed this game as someone who's not very good at juggling, but wanted to practice and learn.

This game seems to have good physics worked out for the balls, and nice views of clouds, but that's about it.

Don't install this game looking to learn how to juggle, because it gives you no assistance, guides, or tips. It's just an app where you are free to throw a ball in the air until you figure it out yourself.","Aug 11, 2018 at 6:08 AM",2, 1,
