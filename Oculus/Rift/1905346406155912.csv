2022-05-28 15:45:09.713175,Matt3672,A must have game for VR!!,I've always liked rhythm games and this one stands out as one of the best! Excellent songs & music packs along with a tonne of custom songs that make you want to come back and beat your high scores. Can't recommend enough.,Apr 26 at 1:09 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:45:09.730130,lunchboxnyhcvr,This game is life!,Since I got this game I have not stopped  playing it.. this game needs to be recognized and appreciated as much as beat Saber. A must own for quest and pc vr gamers.,Jan 6 at 1:59 AM,5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:45:09.746087,MrrrNoboody,Resource hog,"Nice idea, but screwed by bad execution. Even with a decent PC you'll run into frequent performance issues. Looks like developers are lerning on this one how to create games. Additionally most of OST maps are rather bad quality.",Jan 30 at 5:32 AM,1, 0,"We're sorry to hear that you're having bad performance on the PC version of the game, we would love to hear from you if there is anything we can do to improve your experience - there are many configuration options which can change your experience on the Rift version of the game.  Please reach out to us at synthridersvr.com and we'll try and help you get back to playing, including any aspects of the game which you feel you are currently missing."

2022-05-28 15:45:09.777004,HeyItsRamza,This game alone is worth having VR for,"I play this game every single day, and have since I bought it, and I have lost almost 30lbs while also having a ton of fun. No other rhythm game is as satisfying to master. High end play is plenty competitive with a worldwide leaderboard and new tracks coming out regularly. Caravan Palace DLC blew me away, and I'm even more impressed by the newest Muse pack. Thank you devs. Special shoutout to whoever programed the movements for the song Eden, that track on master makes my soul happy.",Oct 3 at 12:20 PM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:45:12.892671,Dan_Santa_Monica,Beat Saber eat your heart out!,"This is probably the most polished VR rhythm game out there. It also has a healthy number of different play modes, such as rhythm (accuracy) versus force (hit velocity), spin mode (90 up to 360 + vertical modes), and multiplayer power-ups (which is like a certain ""kart"" based multiplayer), but what I really love most about this game is the community. The devs are very receptive and are always coming out with new song packs and happy to answer questions in the Discord. If you haven't checked out the Saturday Synth Fever community sessions hosted by HeyFalcon_ or The Sunday Sessions, it's a great way to get into the game.",Aug 16 at 6:12 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:45:12.907631,BastiaanTalsma,Best music rhytm fitness game,"This is the best 100 times better than beat saber. It is fun and easy to learn.
It puts a smile on my face and is a hefty workout!
You can customize it to youre liking and best of all CUSTOM SONGS.
O and it is cross_buy which is awesome. 
Did I say I like this already!..  Try it!",Sep 2 at 3:34 PM,5, 4,

2022-05-28 15:45:12.936554,Celaderith,The best VR Rhythm game out there,No contest.,Jul 3 at 4:01 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:45:12.951514,Cold_Junction,Amazing Game !,"I got VR just this year for first time, and i was always dreaming about beat saber but turned out that i really suck at it and not enjoying that at all, so instead i spent some time looking for other games and then Synth Riders happened .. this game along with Pistol Whip are my most favorite VR games ! There is no point of shower if you want to go back to play because you will be sweating alot along with dancing to amazing tracks ! .. definitely recommending to lovers of good music & people who loves to swing booty (works very well also as cardio for me a bigger guy)","Apr 12, 2021 at 3:48 AM",5, 9,
