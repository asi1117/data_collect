My only gripe is that the controls during the landing sequence are abysmal. It seems like maybe there are several different control styles, and they swap without warning. Either way, I'm a veteran KSP player, with thousands of hours logged, and I was entirely unable to complete the landing. It ruined the immersion completely.",3 days ago,3, 0,

No, it's not a mission simultor, nor does to claim to be, but what it does give you is a first person view of one of mankind's greatest achievements, with an opportunity to sit in the cockpit of the Apollo Command Module during liftoff, dock with and pilot the LEM, and of course walk on the surface of the moon while learning about the experiments that were deployed.  The music is stiring and with the additions of historical imagery, mission audio, interviews with the astronauts, and recordings of famous speaches by President Kennedy, it's an immersive experience that rivals any I've tried in VR.","Apr 3, 2021 at 6:19 PM",5, 5,

The reason I gave this title three stars instead of five stars is due to the inaccuracy on the external model of the command/service module.  This sim depicts the original block one that was used on Apollo 1.  Block two service modules were flown on Apollo 7 throught 17.  Please get the details correct, if you can't get this major detail correct, what else is wrong?

2022-05-28 15:07:52.252045,JromanMD,Live a VR story of the greatest journey,"If you own an Oculus Rift, OculusGo or HTC Vive, you can live the story of the greatest journey ever taken by humankind.  The Apollo 11 mission by NASA. You will ride a Saturn Rocket to the Moon with Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. This was by far the journey of a lifetime for me. Keep in mind that the game is more of a documentary format with control abilities scattered throughout the simulation.

If you have been under a rock or didn't learn a thing in school, let me tell you a little secret. The Apollo 11 VR Experience is the story of the greatest journey ever taken by humankind. Now, for the first time, you get to experience the historic event as if you’re there.

Apollo 11 VR features as a new type of documentary, that gives you the ability to relive the events of 1969 through the eyes of those who made it happen and take control of the command module, land the lunar lander, explore the Moon's surface and deploy the lunar experiments all before returning to earth in a dramatic re-entry.

I had the chance to climb aboard Apollo 11 for the journey of a lifetime and here is my video of the experience.  bit.ly/2LChYcT

For now, the invitation is simple: get into Neil Armstrong shoes, take one small step today and climb aboard Apollo 11 for the journey of a lifetime.","May 11, 2019 at 11:00 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 15:07:55.358736,DogTailRed2,Excellent improvements to the original,"I loved the original Apollo 11 for VR. It was one of the first things I purchased for the Rift. Since then I've been hoping for an update to fix the layering and jaggy effect in space. This update fixes that problem and add's better visuals all round. Better sounds and additional little tweaks that make it a better experience. Really glad I purchased this update to help support the developers to improve it still further and make additional experiences.
Just one minor point. I didn't notice the Apollo 11 switch to internal power in HD?  In the old version the capsule lights flickered and came on illuminating the capsule. It was a nice touch but maybe I just missed it?

When I found out there was an upgraded version I purchased it  immediately. I am happy I did. The graphics are much improved. Some sequences have been improved cinematically. You can see Neil Armstrong speaking with visible lips moving in this edition. For space fans, I recommend purchasing this edition.

2022-05-28 15:07:58.513299,scjenks72,Amazing,"Absolutely amazing, and well-worth the price. I am a HUGE fan of this title. If you're into space travel and/or space history, you need this title in your library. The cabins are gorgeous, I feel like I was there. It's given me a much greater appreciation for what it must have been like for the Apollo astronauts. I do wish more of the gauges were actually working. Audio is fantastic, music is really good. I just spent 3 hours in this thing and it felt like 20 mins. Blown away!

Update Wish List: 
Give us hands and arms in Interactive Mode! 
Let me interact with the pen and nudge or flick it across the cabin. 
Make more gauges work to bring the cabin to life a little more. 
I'd love to see the astronauts actually crawl from the Command Capsule, through the hatch and into the Lunar Lander and do that first-person too. 
Higher-res lunar surface textures during the landing stage of the mission - the textures should change to those of the surface from the moonwalk stage as you get close to the surface. 
Option to switch thruster control on Lunar Lander to right trigger button. 
Maybe provide a bit more explanation of how to control the lunar lander. 
Option to switch Jump control to left trigger button.
Please fix the camera - the lunar landscape is always in the foreground on the images you take and gets in front of near-field objects.
I'd love to dock back with the Command Module for the journey home to Earth.
Reduce astronaut glow during re-entry phase. 
I'd love to have the re-entry phase be longer and progress naturally to the parachute deployment stage after watching the Command Capsule enter the atmosphere as I look out the window.

Awesome job, devs. This is my new favorite VR title!","Jan 31, 2019 at 3:03 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:07:58.528259,Variable128,,"I love the original so I immediately went for this one when I saw it in the store. The good stuff:

-The whole HD face lift. The Earth looks amazing, as does the reflective metal textures on the spacecraft which look photo-realistic. The surface of the moon during the EV exploration in the original was lacking a bit, and this completely brings it up to standard. It's evident there's some really talented people working on this. 

- There are some more details added (I believe), such as extra NASA staff members in the background. 

- You can see your touch controllers in the app, and that helps in the interactive sections. 

Here's the bad: 

- Changes to the LEM landing section are problematic. Visually, the surface of the moon (during the landing phase) looked much better in the original. In this version, it almost appears as though your looking at it through an old cathode ray tube with static interference. 

Also, the handling of the LEM seems to have changed, especially very close to the surface. For instance, just pitching the craft forward slightly near the surface translated into 50 fps altitude gain, and I rapidly flew out of range. I've landed in the original more than two dozen times with a decent score, but in this it was functionally unplayable. 

If the interactive bits don't matter too much, I'd say go with it. For me, the ability to experience landing on the moon is a really important part of the app, so I think I'm going to have to hit ""refund"" and restore the original. 

(I don't see other complaints about this, so I realize this may just be some problem with my machine...though I don't think so. If it is addressed in the future, I'll happily hand over my money and get it again.)","Feb 13, 2019 at 9:59 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 15:07:58.544216,RuneSR2,Horrible performance,"Using super sampling (ss) 2.0 on a GTX 1080 the original version performed perfectly at 90 fps, while this new HD version delivers 45 fps or worse (also using ss 2.0). I'm really surprised of the complete lack of quality assurance on this updated version - of course using new textures should NOT create such a massive performance impact! Furthermore I actually like the original version better: using super sampling 2.0 textures aren't bad in the original version. The SPUD effect is less pronounced in the original version. In short - crank up super sampling to the max in the original version and stay far away from this heavily unoptimazed and extrmely hardware-demanding version, which completely ruined one of my best ever experiences on the Rift. I will be refunding this version, it's not even worth the 5 bucks I paid for it, sadly.","Feb 13, 2019 at 7:04 AM",1, 3,

2022-05-28 15:07:58.580120,GTFreeFlyer,Extraordinary!,"After getting my Oculus and trying out a bunch of games, I still felt like I was missing something.  I just didn't know what it was until I found Apollo 11.  It is not a game; it is an experience.  It's so nice to just sit back and enjoy something beautiful like this.  You do have the option to interact with it and try your hand at maneuvering the spacecraft for docking and lunar landing, but you can also choose to just sit back and watch it like a movie.  Absolutely worth the $10 for sure.  I wish there were more productions such as this one.  It was put together really well, from the amazing graphic models, to the actual audio clips pulled from historical archives.  My only complaint would be that it isn't long enough.  While it is just as long as a typical movie, I felt that it went by too quickly and I needed to be in that capsule for several days just to get the real, true experience!  I just didn't want it to end.

Next time you feel like going out to the movies and spending some cash, choose to purchase this instead.  It's cheaper and will likely be more satisfying.","Feb 12, 2019 at 1:35 PM",5, 2,

I love this experience. Big improvements over the original. Great work on the reflective surfaces of the Lunar Lander and the Command Module. Also appreciate the little corrections to some of the inaccuracies. I would hope that the developers will continue to improve and expand some more. They did some great work with the external views. Would like to have something like that for the launch and sequencing of each stage. Maybe have it as an option so as to keep it short for those who aren't interested in that stuff. Great job overall!

The spud issue is back with this and oculus spheres. The issue is still fixed in the original Apollo 11 app but for some reason in the new version, the black scenes are a grainy grey. Breaks the immersion. Oculus please fix. You fixed it before but on this and Spheres, the problem is back. Other that this, outstanding update and experience.","Dec 8, 2018 at 1:57 AM",5, 31,
2022-05-28 15:08:01.716731,sdplayer,Excellent Update!,"I remember sending an email to Drash about 5/6 months ago enquiring about higher quality textures for this. I doubt this release is in anyway connected to that email but I'm greatful to the team for the update. If this HD version had been released in 2016 it would have been an excellent showcase for VR! 

Someone has mentioned about black level issues but I personally have not noticed this. Overall it seems better for me. The only time I experienced some slightly jerky animation was on Armstrong during the descent to the moon (not sure what was going on) otherwise everything ran buttery smooth (GTX 1080) and the new visuals make an already great experience even better.

I'm happy to pay for this again but I really hope if there are any further updates to Apollo 11 they come at a discount for people who already own it!","Dec 14, 2018 at 9:34 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:08:01.730693,Angelina Starr,WOW!  Simply Amazing Sim,"I was 6 years old when  they landed on the moon.  My dad was in the air force and we were stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, California where a lot of the astronaut training was going on at the time.  I was allowed to stay home from school to watch the launch of Apollo 11.  

This sim not only takes me back to that time personally, but then throws me into the command and lunar modules to ""witness"" it all first hand - from launch, to landing and then reentry.  What an incredible experience and well worth the price of admission.

It was a nice and unexpected touch for the sim to open in a 60s era living room, complete with lava lamp and ""Moon Chair"".   An 8mm projector plays the famous Kennedy speech from 1962 on the wall while at the same time it's showing on a television on the other side of the room.

Well done, devs.  Well done.  I'm looking forward to showing this off at my next gathering.","Dec 17, 2018 at 7:13 AM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 15:08:04.889245,TheLaw4K,More could have been shown,"Overall it's ok/good, but there could have been more optional information about the mission itself (e.g where they slept during). Also the docking of the lander and the orbit module isn't shown.","Feb 11, 2019 at 1:26 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:08:04.904205,Kevin_Brook,Excellent but questionable repurchase,"Let's start with the positives. This IS one of the most essential experiences you can have in virtual reality and the developer VR immersive have created some truly groundbreaking stuff for vr over the past couple years. This, Titanic and Berlin 1943 are all stunning experiences that simply must be viewed, it's what the medium was invented for. I'd also check out their free educational social experience Engage on Steam as well. and you can see what an awesome company they are.

However, this isn't a new title. Apollo 11 HD is the previous Apollo 11, which many of us had already bought, but with better textures, and a couple of extra animations, essentially it's a beta update, except that here they have released it as an entirely new game, and priced for £7.99.

Is it worth it? If you don't own the original, absolutely. For those that do? Well, I'm not sure really. I bought it to support the devs as they have done some great stuff, but really its the same exact game as before, just with a bit better graphical effects. If you would be happy paying for Skyrim twice to get an official texture mod, or being charged for DLC every time Rec Room released a new game mode then you'll have no problem paying for this. If, like me, you're used to seeing VR games get constant updates and new features added for free you might be hoping this is a trend that doesn't catch on.

In short  I'm happy to do it this time, but if they release a Titanic HD next and I have to buy the game again I will be calling time on this company's practices.","Dec 22, 2018 at 2:49 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 15:08:04.919165,Raunhofer,"Awful Performance, mediocre experience","The recommended GPU for this game is GTX 970. I happened to use a PC with an overclocked GTX 970 and a i7-3770K. The performance was awful. Totally unplayable. The moment you enter the module, you can't turn your head without some severe jitter, ghosting and lag. You can't adjust the graphics.

The experience also has many absolutely unnecessary video pans that can cause nausea to unexperienced users. I would not use this as a demo experience.

Graphics are pretty poor. Nothing really looks real and scaling is off here and there. The interior of the module is pretty clean.

The experience does have educational value, but unfortunately the execution waters it down.","Dec 26, 2018 at 12:43 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 15:08:08.026854,PoolfanVr,Like DVD to Blu-Ray,"I bought the first version of this about a year ago and absolutely loved it - this newer version is admittedly identical in most respects but the graphics have been given an overhaul.  Think of it as buying the Blu Ray of a DVD you already own.

I did not resent buying the game again because it is very little money for such an awe inspiring experience and just think of the amount of times you have probably bought Star Wars on Video, DVD, Blu Ray  (and 4k when Disney get their act together)

If you do not have the orignal version then just buy this HD version right now but if you have the original then I would say don't expect a whole new experience but you will enjoy the better graphics and are supporting further development of this sort of educational content.","Dec 25, 2018 at 4:49 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:08:08.073728,jdmaltz,I adore this but needs some minor fixes,"I adore this app and the original as it is one of the best experiences for the oculus and being a massive Apollo/Nasa nerd I love it. This a noticeable graphical upgrade and it looks beautiful. Having the command module reflective is a welcome improvement and the moon looks gorgeous, just gorgeous. The CSM and LEM interiors are beautiful and the exploring option is a welcome addition. That said there are a few minor mistakes which take me out of the experience which I feel could be fixed trivially. First and most importantly in the sequence in lunar orbit there is a noticible issue between the relative size of the lem and CSM (the CSM looks 5-10% too big, once you see it you can't unsee it). Second in the TLI and in transposition and docking the third stage SLA panels have black and red markings which look like an old texture from the third stage of the sa 500f test article not apollo 11 which is completely wrong it should just be white. What confuses me is when the rocket is on the pad, it is correct and then it changes to this. I loved the reentry sequence in the original it seems to have been made tamer here (far less shaking, I like it better the way it was before) and finally as several  other people have noted the dark black sequences have a grey haze, the contrast has been turned down a bit it seems.   

I just want to repeat I absolutely love this experience and I only mention these nitpicks because the authors clearly care about the material and  such a monumental effort shouldn't be marred by a few tiny mistakes, so I wrote this in the hope that they would correct it before final release.  

Anyway I have purchased this and the developer's other title on the Titanic, both are wonderful, keep up the good work!","Dec 18, 2018 at 4:20 PM",5, 1,
