2022-05-28 16:01:25.236505,FastLawyer,worst BBC VR production,"I have enjoyed almost every BBC VR video available on the Oculus store. However, this one was pretty boring. Just bad director. Bad video quality. Bad story. The middle part of the production brought animations out of nowhere that really adding nothing to the experience. Not really worth the free download, even if you're desperate for new content.","Mar 30, 2018 at 1:58 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 16:01:25.251465,Jaaq,Wont start.,"I can't work out how to start the program, can anyone advise? I've tried pressing buttons, keyboard, mouse and hovering the dot over the video and title.","May 2, 2018 at 12:29 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 16:01:25.265428,FoudForSoul,Don't expect much,"It is very very short, it does not have much facts and interesting information. The graphics are quite bad compared to state of art VR experiences. I wouldn't spend time installing it.","Jan 5, 2018 at 10:10 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 16:01:28.400044,vodathan,Can't review coz it doesn't work,I have pushed every button on both touch controllers the 3 or 4 times I've booted up but the play button on screen just blinks at me stupidly!,"Nov 29, 2017 at 9:09 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 16:01:28.415004,Frog_Jacuzzi,Would be good 360 content but broken,"This only ever worked for me briefly, once. The view goes very wrong, and I end up near one side of the image sphere. Distortions are strange as I turn my head, even given that fact. It was a good enough 360 until then, on my one experience when it lasted a couple of minutes.

The other downside is that this content hardly deserves its own app. It could be (and maybe has been) subsumed into a more versatile app for browsing many 360 videos like this.","Oct 27, 2017 at 9:04 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:01:28.429964,VR7938,Why?,"Just, why?  It wasn't filmed in 3D. VR lends nothing to a 2D documentary. Although I like wildlife docu's this was just pointless as a VR experiance.  Don't waste your time.","Nov 13, 2017 at 7:43 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 16:01:28.443927,demotricus,Meh.,"Can`t even start it playing. It says  Occulus touch compatible. Umm, nope, nothing I pressed, wiggled or keypressed on either the keyboard or touch controllers made the slightest difference, and no instructions at all visible. I even had to exit, by killing the process in file manager. Sooo.. No marks out of ten from me.","Sep 26, 2017 at 10:29 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 16:01:28.458887,nightcat.mau,Short And Sweet!,"A caracal mom and her offspring are out on the daily hunt and we get to listen as her daughter explains the hunt for birds. Granted, these cats can't talk, but who else was rooting for mom to catch a bird? Beautiful to see these amazing felines this close and having the daughter explain how important the hunt is for them can help viewers get some facts that aren't just thrown at them.","Sep 13, 2017 at 1:27 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:01:31.563583,Yusufu2017,It has some potential.,"The idea is there, but it is not a good VR experience because of these problems:
1. No 3D effect.
2. No Locamotion. (can't be helped with videos)
3. Low frame rate.","Oct 3, 2017 at 2:16 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:01:31.579540,HisRoyalMajestyM,Not too good,"This is actually the worst 3D experience I had in Oculus Rift. I'm not saying it's terrible, but after seeing ""few"" things, this has to rank the lowest of everything I've seen so far.
Narration was super annoying too, constantly reffering to the cat as mother, as in I'm supposed to be the kitten. Bite me, just make it like NG documentary narration, no need for further immersion by pretending I am the cat.","Apr 15, 2017 at 9:08 AM",2, 6,

2022-05-28 16:01:31.607465,neuro27,Spherical Video mixed with VR,"At first, this app seems like a simple spherical video about nature, but a little over half-way through, it introduces a VR scene with 2 viewpoints and a few information boxes that expand the education of the presentation. As this is a free app with a novel idea, it's worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of nature videos like me!","Jun 20, 2017 at 10:16 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:01:31.622425,Babomancer,Lag in a video player,I can't even view this crummy sphere. The menu runs fine but I can't view the rest without lagging video and audio.,"Apr 12, 2017 at 1:10 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 16:01:34.717148,im.visualcortex,,Yet another 2D video projected on a sphere. Look at the Obama video to see what the real 3D movie is.,"Apr 5, 2017 at 1:00 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 16:01:34.732108,NullPointers,,Some really good footage and sound design but it's really a shame that the video portions aren't in 3D. I'm also not a fan of the first-person narration but I’m glad that the planet earth team are experimenting in VR.,"Mar 13, 2017 at 4:29 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:01:34.746071,nrosko,Very mixed reviews for this.,"This is a great little nature video, I really hope to see more of this kind of thing as it puts a different perspective on this genre. Presentation is good but  would have been nice if the video was all 3d.","Mar 3, 2017 at 3:23 AM",4, 3,
