2022-05-28 18:23:38.461736,rh_galaxy,Need both touch AND gamepad,"The A button does not respond on the gamepad, only on touch. On touch the LT and RT (triggers?) does not respond, only on gamepad... the game is therefore not easily playable, one could almost say that the puzzles are unsolvable... regret not getting a refund in time. I bet that gamepad was working at first, but they broke both when implementing touch... Got this game a year ago, and this will never get fixed, they should remove the game!","Dec 2, 2018 at 9:51 PM",1, 2,"We're very sorry for the issue. We discovered this issue a while ago. We never implemented Touch Support, but somehow the input seems mixed up when you use Touch. Until we update the game, quick solution is just using a Gamepad (without connecting the Touch)."

I am slightly surprised that no one else has mentioned the problems with the game controls. I have to use both my Oculus Touch controllers and the XBOX controller when playing this game. The game will not allow me to use the triggers on Oculus Touch in place of the RT on the XBOX controllers and it doesn't let me use the XBOX controller for normal gameplay. It is annoying to have to use the Oculus Touch controllers and switch between the XBOX controller just to use my RT.","Jun 16, 2017 at 3:55 PM",3, 5,"We're very sorry for the issue.

2022-05-28 18:23:38.507613,jon,Repetitive,"I originally bought the game thinking its doll house style graphics would make it an excellent game to use in a demo for my younger neice.  In truth, the puzzle nature of it is probably a bit too complicated for younger kids and so I ended up demoing Oculus with other games.  I played through the first few levels, and while a decent puzzle game the VR aspect seems unneeded - the game probably would have been just as enjoyable as a non-vr title.  Additionally, the levels got repetitive and stale for me.  Ultimately I set the game down for several months (still having not completed it) and posted this review before uninstalling it.","Mar 9, 2017 at 8:33 PM",3, 1,

I got to know this game first on my Android smartphone, and I enjoyed it at the time, but I knew that there was a VR version and downloaded it right away.
It seems to be the best game too. Unlike the Android version, VR seems to be better. I am very satisfied because I do not feel VR Sickness! Good Stuff!","Mar 31, 2017 at 9:54 AM",5, 1,

And the gameplay and puzzles are even better. It is hard to see in other VR games. The most important thing is that there is no dizziness at all.","Mar 31, 2017 at 11:43 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:23:41.642229,chmodseven,Nifty little puzzler,"As a puzzle game, Rooms is quite challenging and fun, and has an interesting mechanic, although after a while it gets a bit samey.  VR doesn't add anything to the gameplay here, although it's still enjoyable to be able to look around or peer more closely.  Worth it if you like puzzle games.","Nov 27, 2016 at 6:27 PM",4, 0,

In VR, you can tell that the character isn't actually standing on anything at the top of a ladder for instance.  Far from adding anything, the VR integration only points out how they faked things in 2D.  The music is also very intrusive.","Nov 4, 2016 at 7:04 AM",2, 1,
