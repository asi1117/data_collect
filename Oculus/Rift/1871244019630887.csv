2022-05-28 18:46:58.563989,Troy1637,Unrealisic,Why would a SWAT officer be sent in with a glock and nothing else? It make 0 scence. Its extremely hard to get a medkit and explosions can kill you from even a  distance away,Feb 18 at 6:59 AM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:46:58.577952,ubelsteiner,Fun on your knees,"A great co-op experience.  However it relies heavily on you taking cover behind mostly waist-height objects.  To the point where there's just no real point in ever standing up, so you'll spend the whole game on your knees probably. Not easy for anyone who has knee trouble or really those with leg movememt disabilities in general.  

It would be great to have a crouch button option, so people just could stand or sit and not have to be crawling around on the floor the whole time.  Best solution I've found is to set the height level to the lowest setting, but, even then, a tall person like myself still has to be constantly hunching down.  

Other than the lack of this disability-friendly option, it would be a 5-star game.","Dec 12, 2020 at 5:46 AM",4, 10,

2022-05-28 18:46:58.607872,REIZOD,Fun Game Worth The Price,"This game is tough, but FUN!  I reminded me of an old school shoot'em-up game but in VR.  Some things need to be improved, like faster bullet speed, and sound effects.  Things that I think would improve this game would be to allow for use of ony one touch controller, customizable weapon (add a laser, extended mag) which some law efnorcement agencies can do, espcially SWAT units.  Overall this game is really fun to play, and I'm very much lookng forward to more content updates.","Feb 20, 2020 at 12:00 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:47:01.717556,wilmerlin,Fun game mechanic,"Old school arcade shooter ported to VR.  I purchased the Rift version to support a future Quest-build.

The developers have been gracious enough to make a beta build available on Quest and it really shines as a wireless VR experience.  This is one of the few shooting games that really captures the feel of 'duck and cover,' returning fire from behind a car or wall for fear of your life. 

Even though the game is quite difficult, you get the hang of it quickly (dying  is a great lesson to take cover).  It's  a terrific effort for some indie developers.   I really hope the sequel makes it into the Quest store.

Feb 2020 Update: still love this game!  There are two levels and second mission isn't nearly as difficult as the first (or maybe my skills have improved) but the shootout at the harbor/port is a lot of fun.  Anyway, I urge you to support these indie developers.  We need more games like this on Quest.","Feb 14, 2020 at 4:45 AM",5, 7,

Only thing is that your play space needs to be decent because you do use that cover also if you wanted a game that got you to move this is it,"Dec 22, 2019 at 12:01 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:47:01.778392,Gecko-VR,Gameplay that is a must experience!,"This game right off the bat is something else! Imagine those shooter arcade games where you’re stationed in a spot and clear the area before moving on. Well that’s what this game is, except it totally takes advantage of it being a VR game which is super important!

You’re forced to physically duck and take cover as you have several enemies rapidly firing at you. You’ll raise your gun over your cover and start blindly mag dumping hoping you’ll hit someone. Eventually you put a fresh mag in your pistol, take a breath, and then stand out of cover and shoot as many targets before they shoot you.

In most shooters when you have unlimited ammo it ruins the shooting mechanics and the stakes. Not this game. You’re so focused on taking down the targets and not being shot. It’s not like you can just stand in the open and just constantly mag dump. 3 shots (on Rookie, 1 shot on Hell) you’re dead and have to restart the mission.

Numerous enemies shooting at you at once, limited lives, and 7 minutes to complete the objective, the stakes are high and the action is amazing!

My only critique is the controls and tracking. I’m a very picky VR player and I pay attention to details. Your in game hands are noticeably farther away from you than your real life hands. To “grab” your mag you use the front trigger instead of the grip button. Just a huge thing I have where I dislike grabbing things without using the grip trigger, doesn’t feel natural.

Other than that little thing, outstanding game!","Jul 18, 2019 at 7:13 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:47:04.882091,VR-CG-Gamer,"Super Fun, Challenging, Classic Arcade","So I have a Rift S, but I played this game sideloaded on my Quest, because it’s completely wireless and I don’t have to worry about the cable getting in my way and I can take it with me when I travel. I loved the game, it looks great... the classic arcade style graphics work really well on the quest. The gameplay is intense, challenging and fun. It’s great ducking, dodging bullets and retuning fire. 

The game mechanics are really good, I would only suggest slight a few slight adjustments... changing gripping action to middle finger trigger and making reload easier.

It would be great if the developers continue working on more scenarios as additional paid DLC missions, so in the future we could buy and play more levels!

I purchased the rift version of this game and left a review here to support the developer and to let oculus and potential customers know how much fun this game is. Can’t understand why the game could have been rejected, game is perfect for quest, lucky we have a rift version available and the side load option for tech savvy quest users.

I hope the developers are able to get this onto the official quest store, so It gets exposure, more people get a chance to play the game and the developers are able to generate enough revenue to continue making more DLC and future versions of the game.

Would also like to give a special thanks to the developer who, after investing a lot of time and effort into the Quest version of this game, then having the game rejected by Oculus for the Quest store, still making the effort to find a way to make the game available to Quest users.","Jun 30, 2019 at 10:12 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:47:04.897051,dbocking,Just buy it,"I wasn't sure about the game because a bunch of people on Steam said it was frustratingly hard, but I took a chance and I highly recommend you do too. You die a lot, but you just dive right back into the action. 

The meager three hits you can take before you have to start over makes you really fear those bullets comming at you and really gives you a sense of a high stakes gun battle. When you manage to off 3 baddies in a row before diving for cover you feel like John McClane bringing justice to Nakatomi Tower. Yippie Kayay Mother F**ker","Jul 17, 2019 at 10:30 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:47:04.912011,Rifty50,This game. So simple but so fun.,"But with that said the controls are kinda wack and there needs to be a left-handed mode (although you can shoot left-handed, I want to see the mags on the right side as well so it's easier to grab).","Jul 30, 2019 at 9:26 AM",5, 0,

this game is great, you have to duck and crouch and that just feels really immersive. and the best part: it is really hard, not like those new games that you can beat first try but like those old Mario games that you had to try again and again and again.","Jun 26, 2019 at 7:42 PM",5, 36,

Sometimes there are gems that with the freedom of the Quest just go together perfectly. The ability to duck behind desks and peek out to shoot and even move about freely within your play space just makes this intense shooter well worth having. I would have paid more than £4.49 for this. Just hope the developer makes more content for it.","Jun 26, 2019 at 3:32 AM",5, 29,

Minor config improvement: I agree, trigger should not be used for grabbing, that is what the grab button is for. Move drop ammo to a/b button and grabbing to grab button.","Jun 27, 2019 at 1:48 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 18:47:11.254048,meishseeks,Proper arcade gem,"Buying this game to support the developers as they made it  available for free to side load it felt only right that even though I don’t own a rift that I in some way  support this title as I enjoy it so much & would happily spend at least £5 on this game if it was available on the quest store more if there was more missions added , This is as I’ve said in the title of my review is a proper arcade gem of a VR game, I sideloaded it after watching Mike from the YouTube channel virtual reality oasis & members of the quest groups on Facebook talk about this game. 
I love the style of the game & that you actually have to duck and take cover before peeking out & shooting the bad guys, this game mechanic & the way you can hold the two controllers like a gun without any tracking issues ,really makes you feel like your part of the action & all yippee ki a 
I’m normally good @ shooting games but this element makes it harder, this coupled with the three life’s  gives the game more playability therefore you keep coming back for more, it reminds me of computer games of old when there was no saved games &  if you died  you kept coming back as you just wanted to beat the game.
This will definitely be a title I will keep coming back to. Hopefully oculus can give this game another chance & it will be on the quest store soon as it’s got so much potential","Jul 16, 2019 at 10:12 AM",5, 4,

However there are few issues worth fixing:
- Update new Touch controller model for Quest and Rift S
- Give option to change to traditional controller binds using A to drop magazine and grip buttons to grip weapon and new magazines
- Fix the bug where one cannot shoot retry level if they have no ammo left when they die","Jun 30, 2019 at 5:33 AM",5, 10,
