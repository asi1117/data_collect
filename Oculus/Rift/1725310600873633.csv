2022-05-28 14:44:27.302014,STARGÅTER1,for some reason i cant get this to play?,"in the last few days ive had issues. i do love this game its a great casual sit down to play game, however i dont have a clue why but it will not play anymore. maybe an update but i hope the devs sort it if its on there end. ive tried reinstaling but it quits on me every time.

This has been released for a good while now and its unfinished, It really is time to get pt2 up and running. I'm sceptical at this point that it will get an update to finish the campaign and anything to improve the game but I am eager because its a good intro to vr space flying/ shooters. We just need a little bit more. By the time we're getting into this game it's already over and it's such a shame. Pc version is free and better graphics but I can't seam to carry over the same control scheme to pc. Over all if the price is right this is a great value game. Feels and looks nice enough on quest2, nice backdrops but the sense of high speed dogfighting is a little bit on the slow side considering your in space. I recommend the experience to new vr Gamers as they're the ones who will enjoy the most. It's well made and looks absolutely fine on the quest2",Feb 19 at 6:42 AM,4, 18,

2022-05-28 14:44:27.346893,Kunakai,Meh.,"Upload VR seem as generous as most VR enthusiasts. Honestly getting pretty tired of VR games getting high ratings when they'd barely be seen as passable on any other platform. 

It's as basic as space combat games get. Heck, Star Wars Rogue Squadron on the N64 has more veriety. Shoot missiles, shoot cannons, rinse repeat. 

I only paid £10 for this game, I'd rather have the money in hindsight. 

Some people say this game looks good. It doesn't. The cockpit looks okay but the backgrounds look like they'd be better suited to something from 2004.","Apr 13, 2021 at 4:48 PM",2, 36,

I can now play it/navigate in the way that feels the most comfortable for me using controller.  Even better, the game is currently (as of 12/7/20) on sale, and a must buy for any space sim/flight fans!  Thanks to the developer for reply and notification of the updates to the controls.","Dec 8, 2020 at 5:21 AM",4, 29,

however the ship customiseation is lacking, the capital ships hitboxes are wierd and make no sence, when you try to fly right above the hull you smash into invisible barrier after invisible barrier.

very few levals.

because of this, i recommend this game to get you used to vr if you are new, but not as fun if you are old","Nov 21, 2020 at 11:10 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 14:44:30.505590,woodat,Slow meandering with no challenge,You just seem to fly slowly around a bunch of enemies that pose little to no threat.

Had to end up using the mouse button which was ok, but it'd be nice to not have to peak under the VR headset to find the mouse and also pick arrow and Enter keys for menu options. Really fun game to play though.","Apr 6, 2020 at 3:04 AM",4, 16,I have tested on the Quest and this is working as of the 1.0.6 update!

2022-05-28 14:44:30.550470,Metalsech,Get spaced!,"Really great space combat game. Lovely visuals and smooth ship controls. However disappointed that I can't swap round the stick controls to my liking (to me it feels like the yaw and roll should be swapped round). Only other downside is there's not a very big selection of weapons to unlock, nor any other ship upgrades. This could be expanded substantially.","Mar 23, 2019 at 8:52 PM",4, 28,
2022-05-28 14:44:33.666771,Luagha,"Easy, pretty experience.","It's a beautiful, enjoyable and comfortable experience to show off VR and offer some Wing Commander nostalgia - If you're after a pretty space power fantasy to breeze through this fits the bill! But even my 10 year old nephew commented on how he never felt like he might lose. (Which was a plus for him. He loved it even after I got bored of the difficulty.)

After very positive initial impressions I was disappointed that the difficulty never meaningfully increased from the first missions and regret paying the PC price. I ended up bouncing between 3-4 stars for a while before concluding that challenge may simply not be a design goal in the first place.","Jan 19, 2019 at 12:52 PM",4, 18,We are working on a new mode that should prove quite challenging :)

It takes a little time to get used to, but who cares? It moves fast and plays exactly as advertised. And it's single player, which is exactly what I wanted.  Granted, it's not Lone Echo (what is?), but it is nicely done, lots of fun, does what it claims, doesn't make you motion sick, and doesn't need extended play. Really nice job guys. And *definitely* worth the price","Oct 16, 2018 at 9:42 AM",4, 4,Thanks for the nice words! Glad you enjoy it.
2022-05-28 14:44:33.697689,ohgrant,,"Game play not too bad. The 3D effect seems to be the fake looking z-buffer type.  The graphics look too much like a cartoon. I play games on last generation VR gear that are 20 years old and look much better than this in VR.  Bad 3D, bad graphics.

Edit for dev: Thanks for the response, lol @ no depth in space.  I have imax movies about the space station that prove otherwise.  almost every space sim that was ever made starting with SW Rogue Sqadron was a much better experiance in 3D with my old Z800 HMD.  Modern real world VR flight-sims, like X-plane, are making great strides and are as closse to real life as currently possible.  Not the case with VR space sims.  I'm sorry but your game looks like a low res cartoon by comparison. 
  I can only hope that this dev gives up this ludicrous notion of no depth in space or moves on to program desktop games.  I've kept it installed hoping for an update to make things better. I don't play in 2D, even if I'm in a 3D cockpit. I'm uninstalling and reducing my rating to 1 star because of the dev's attitude about 3D.","Dec 28, 2018 at 3:18 AM",1, 13,"The Ohgrant, Sorry to hear you feel that way. Many other people really like the graphics. however your fake z-buffer type of 3D comment is completely wrong. That isn't even possible with how End Space is built. The problem when people complain about the 3D effect has more to do with End Space uses real world units, and anything past 60 meters has no real depth to it. In space where things are kilometers away you would not have a sense of depth. This is why miniature games looks so great in VR, because everything is small and the 3D effect is really enhanced."
2022-05-28 14:44:33.712649,ErikTheAngry,"Pretty good, but pretty short","Game ended on what I would consider a cliff hanger.  I assume more will come in the future, I certainly hope so.  I had fun.  In the end, on sale it is worth the money.

Some criticisms:
- The campaign is short.. very short.  You'll complete it in one sitting with ease.
- Your income on missions seems pointless.. I had everything unlocked halfway through the game
- The upgrades are kind of ""meh"".  1 new missile system, 2 new gun systems.  None of them particularly exciting or interesting over their counterparts.  At no point did I ever feel using one over the other was really worth the time it took to switch weapon systems (which was of course as simple as a single button push).
- It wasn't challenging.  At all.  I had a little trouble with one mission but that was more to do with me being stubborn than the mission.  Want to make it more challenging?  Have the enemy ships shoot at you more.","Sep 4, 2018 at 3:23 AM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 14:44:33.728607,MattSamiA,Awesome game and awesome support!,"I too have been playing this since it was released on Gear VR and I was so happy to come back and re try it on the Rift. Its a fun, spectacular graphics space shooter thats not to over the top in depth, but has enough to keep you coming back. Thanks heaps for the support in the transfer from gear vr to rift. My emails were answered within 2 hours!. Excellent support and I cant wait to see this game evolve more! Thanks guys! (quit your day job and work more on this game haha) -
Update - ""For Mina"" I found it in a locker haha :) . The way you can now use your oculus touch controls as a joystick is AMAZING! Who needs to go buy a $300 joystick with a few buttons when you guys have made this happen just with the Oculus controls. Twist, move up/ down, yaw, all the exact same as using a joystick! and you can see it in cockpit.  I suggest just using head tracking for firing. and using the oculus virtual controls for the ship movement, Its so fkn good, im seriously impressed. The game is polished, the controls, graphics, flying, IMERSSION. MAKE IT BIGGER PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You must!, I know your only a 2 man team. But this is triple AAA stuff! - Only thing I can suggest at this point. Is make the hanger guy not look a bit frumpy hahahaha. So glad I re tried this on the Rift.","Aug 31, 2018 at 2:54 PM",5, 10,

One comment so far that almost made me totaly delete the game after a few minutes. The controls, totaly crap, i have an Xbox controller plugged, a X-56 Rhino HOTAS, a CH Pro Pedals, so when i get in game, everything is totaly conflicting, view is spinning around all itself etc..etc.. i tried to disable some USB device etc but i ended up telling myself, no way i'm gonna fool around all my deviced earch time i wanna play this game. So i finaly found out, in-game we have all controllers detected and keybinded already, so my Rhino's mini stick was making everything moved all over the place, i cannot tell you how painful it was to select stuff in the menu. Maybe make an option that not al devices are active, but only the one we select, maybe no deviced selected by default.

Touch controls and motion works great and head tracking targeting is also a great addition.
Bit of stuttering on the ship models (not a frame rate issue) which can look a tad sucky when fighting up close.
Also a rest angle for your arms/ hands for both X and Y positions would be great. I cannot get the natural resting tilt of my arm/ hand calibrated with the options as is.

2022-05-28 14:44:39.984225,FolkSong,Good Game (with Excellent Controls!),"I've been playing with a joystick and the controls feel great. I enjoy the combination of having direct control over the ship with the stick while using gaze to aim the guns. Graphics are excellent as well.

My only complaint is that the gameplay feels a bit basic. The enemies don't seem to be much of a threat, you can just line them up one by one and destroy them without taking any damage yourself. There's no difficulty setting either. I think I'm about half way through the game, so hopefully the final missions are more challenging.

I would still recommend it for anyone who enjoys this kind of game, especially on sale.","Mar 19, 2018 at 11:30 AM",4, 5,Thanks FolkSong!
2022-05-28 14:44:40.000182,MaxPowerpoint,Immersive Fun Action Shooter,UPDATED: I poured hours into this game on Gear VR. One the the best VR games for mobile. Even better at high framerates on a PC.

2022-05-28 14:44:40.016139,Eychimo,Just a Fun Title,"I do not see how you can go wrong spending 20 dollars on this title if you enjoy these types of games. I really have no idea why people want to use a joystick in the game. The virtual controls are just so much fun. 
I have had a little more time to explore the End Space and here are my updated thoughts.
 Orange Bridge has given us a fun little space sim, I feel they have delivered on their promises. If your looking for a die hard, bare knuckles, suck up all your time to learn and develope skills to be able to fly, this is not it. It does not claim to be. I judge most my game on a simple method, and that is, Are They Fun. This one is.
I really like being able to use your HMD tracking for controlling your ships yaw and pitch. Being able to use your Oculus Touch controls to let your wrist movments control your gimbaled weapons and roll is a very nice touch. Very immersive. I actually have dual joysticks, gampad, and all the other toys and have not even bothered setting them up for this game because the Touch controls are just so much fun. Here is a video of the 3rd actual mission in the game recorded live. About 10 minutes for this mission and just about non stop action.

2022-05-28 14:44:43.129954,RuneSR2,Weird Touch controls,"Controls simply didn't feel right, also annoying that the ships turns when I try to look at something, textures didn't look great either. Thus this game failed to impress me. Furthermore I'm running Tray Tools forcing super-sampling (SS) 2.0 on everything - and accidentally increasing SS in-game totally crashed this game. Even closing Oculus Home and Tray Tools, and then making a SS 1.0 profile in Tray Tools, the game still felt like running SS 3.6 or something ;-) With a lot of patience I did get everything to work. Developers should be aware of Tray Tools users - we are many - and I usually don't experience any problems. But End Space caused me massive problems.  Also graphics look dated - this does not feel like a Rift game - it rather feels like a light-weight PC game that some time ago passed its prime time. Technically I don't think this game has been tested thoroughly enough. To make this game interesting to me, developers probably would have to start over completely - and develop the game exclusively for the Rift and similar headsets.","Mar 19, 2018 at 4:59 AM",2, 4,"Hi RuneSR2, the controls are very customizable and if you don't want to fly with using your gaze the turn the option off in the settings menu. You can fly with Touch as a virtual joystick or you can just use thumbsticks. Or a gamepad, there are multiple options here.

As for your super sampling issues, there is no way to run super sampling at 2.0 and then increase it the game. You would increase the Render Texture to a size that a GPU couldn't handle. There is also no way for me to detect what 3rd party software you are using to modify games."

Only issue I noticed was using ""look to move"" AND ""look to target"". I could get missiles to lock and fire easy enough, but lasers were difficult to get on target. Will try without ""look to target"" next session. Only other minor note was that I couldn't quit from the ""quit"" button on the board in the hangar.

I've played 10 missions so far and haven't had one single real challenge. The enemy dogfighting is terrible. There's no radar for your ship, the controls are very basic, and there is only a hint of a storyline. So far, almost every mission is: warp in, shoot all the bad guys, warp out. X-wing had really cool challenges, learning how to fly and use the advantages of different ships, manage your shields and other power systems, etc.. So far this has none of that.
