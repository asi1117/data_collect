Initially it seems a little low poly and movement isn't very intuitive but there's something very strange and relaxing about this experience. The fact that there really isn't something you have to do adds to the calmness you feel in it.
There's a surreal quality to it. It reminds me of some dreams I've had. I like it.","Mar 26, 2020 at 3:32 PM",5, 2,

The game is hugely intuitive (once you figure out movement!) and provides a beautiful, safe and calming space to explore. Definitely worth a go, especially as it's free.

Really look forward to seeing more from it's developer!","Feb 17, 2020 at 8:19 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:58:59.428416,nightcat.mau,Great Fun!,"I was going to write about fantastic Mr. Fox, but our in world buddy now seems to be a corgi! Still it's a cute app where you can play with a cybernetic style fox in the outer world and take a corgi on a musical journey on the inner. I'm guessing the fox may have been swapped out due to there being spirit fox and wolf games out right now, but for free it's still a lot of fun to watch those stubby little legs fly over the terrain. And corgis are just as willful as foxes it would seem, so there's that.

If I had any criticisms it would be that smooth turning for us would be nice, and to see the bite and jump features of the outer world transferred to the inner. Also, I know it's asking a lot for free, but will the fox return?","Jan 25, 2020 at 3:17 AM",5, 4,Thanks so much for playing! The dog actually randomizes each time (though the forgi is perhaps my favorite.) I like the idea of using the bite / jump animations.... stay tuned for an update!
