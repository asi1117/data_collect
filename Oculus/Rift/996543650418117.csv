2022-05-28 15:45:48.935272,Joel6315,Extremely fun for 40min,"I really enjoyed that game. It is rather short but very fun to play and lovely put together. Great characters and fantastic features have given me really joy and fun. It is a shame, that the game is rather short that is why I give just four stars.","Feb 17, 2021 at 9:37 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:45:48.964193,Ruukon,Could be better,"I love Adventure Time and its great to hear the original voiced (at least in german). But the game is very short and simple. I think its great for a way younger audience then me (25). Not because of the humor or the look but because of the way to simple gameplay elements. It has only two levels and is played through in 30 minutes. 

If it wasn't with Adventure Time Theme it wouldn't be worth three stars. 

I'm a bit disapointed. If its in sale or cheaper then 5 Euro then try it. But else I would recomment to buy something else. I hope there will be more and better Adventure Time games in the future. But this one can be omitted.","Oct 3, 2018 at 3:08 AM",3, 17,
2022-05-28 15:45:48.979153,JammingSlowly,Great in every way. Just way too short.,"This game started with so much promise.
Great controles, great world, and good humor.
This game had the potential to actually have the right to call it's self a banjo like game.
But just when the going gets good, it ends.
The game only has two levels.
TWO LEVELS.
Why is this ""unfinished"" game being sold for five whole bucks?
Sure I say there was work put into this, but you can buy a game on steam that has at least ten hours worth of game play for that much.
This one has thirty minutes.
A little over an hour if you go slower then normal.
If this was a demo for a full length game, it would be awesome and I would throw money at the devs the second the full thing released... But this is the full thing.
I hope the devs hear the people who want MORE from this game, and they make another one.
But a much longer one.","Feb 12, 2018 at 5:21 AM",2, 23,
2022-05-28 15:45:48.993115,Soggyshoe,Way too short - shouldnt charge for this,As above - not worth it - 2 levels!,"Mar 16, 2018 at 3:56 AM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 15:45:52.139700,EinarThor,Better Touch layout,fun game but hate the fact u need a controller since the button layout on the Oculus touch is all wrong ( need both hands on one controller but still need buttons on the other one) if they would fix that or add button edit menu would make this a great game,"Aug 23, 2017 at 11:35 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:45:52.154659,stargate88,Press any button doesn't work,When the game starts it asks me to press any button but whatever button I press nothing happen. Can't play it.,"Jul 9, 2017 at 8:32 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 15:45:52.169619,neuro27,20 Minutes of VR Adventure Time,"Only consider getting this game if you are a big fan of the TV series. Otherwise, as far as games go, this doesn't have much to offer. You can basically run through the game. The only enemies you need to fight are the first two in the prologue and two when saving LSP. Otherwise there's no real reason. You have 3 hearts, but infinite lives. When you die, you just restart from a nearby checkpoint. The only other element to the game is 9 ""collectibles"" per level, but there is no reward for getting them all. The only challenge to get out of this game would be from speedrunning it - the any% WR is sitting at 7:27 right now.","Apr 22, 2017 at 4:40 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 15:45:55.285286,Veraxus,A demo-length Lucky's Tale mod,"This is basically a demo-length Lucky's Tale repackaged with some Adventure Time assets. It seems pretty obvious that the developers had more levels in mind, but used a creative excuse to jump you straight from the first to the last. Yeah, there are just two levels and less than an hours worth of game here. Still, I've seen this on sale for as little as $1... so if you are interested in a Lucky's Tale style VR platformer, this might be right up your alley.","Apr 21, 2017 at 1:57 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:45:55.301244,All-Gass-No-Breaks,Great but Very short!,"I got this for 99p on sale, so I am well happy.
Its very short, only 2 levels but very funny.
If you like adventure time, you will love this.
If they made a full game out of this I would pay £20, but as it stands its more a demo/mini game.","Apr 14, 2017 at 3:24 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:45:55.315206,yi-wizz,Got it on sale for .99,It's a steal at the sale price. Only 2 levels and pretty short but great game. It's like a slightly more simple version of lucky's tale.,"Mar 31, 2017 at 1:17 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:45:55.346124,ace3093,Very Fun,This game is very fun playformer. Only problem is that it is over before you know it. Only two levels. If you liked Luckys Tail then this is another fun game just like it.,"Mar 29, 2017 at 9:15 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:45:58.456804,theycallmeandrew,Great for Price,"It's just an episode which is why it's the duration you get, but it's awesome because the dilemma is presented from the start and in one 20 minute sitting you actually solve it, unlike most games where you have to come back. Loved the way they made sense of why you're floating above and behind them.","Jan 25, 2017 at 11:46 AM",5, 3,
