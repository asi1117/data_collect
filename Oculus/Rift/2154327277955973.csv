2022-05-28 19:56:09.939662,ajt178,Excellent!,"I have to say, after playing box VR for over a year or so, and don't get me wrong it was great and I still use it (apparently I am grandfathered in to an older copy that doesn't require a subscription service or something)... It was becoming incredibly stagnant.  It also sure doens't seem like they want to make it better by providing new boards or updates.  I was a slave to box vr and its calorie counter... at the time of writting up to 114000 all time calories burned.  NOW, Powerbeats VR.... I was worried they wouldn't have a calorie counter when I bought it, but they do! not only that you can get heartbeat readings as well as power level on your punches.  The movments are more varied and organic than box vr, the song selections are great, and the boards are visually delicious.  THANK YOU for providing competition to a product that was starting to make my eyes glaze over and THANK you for making it fitness oriented.  This program rocks!!! :D",Jan 26 at 8:18 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:56:09.954621,huevytrip,Great Game For Fitness,"I Have to said that this game works great for fitness and still feels great as a game.
Its really make you sweat and work all your body.
Its has really good graphics.
There is not a lot of song but the great part is that you can upload yours mp3 and its generate a good game for that.
Also additional to punches you can unlock fun weapons.
Other thing that I like is the soundsFX.   Other similar games the soundFX doesnt motivate at all
This game its great for what it is.
Hope they came up with more content.",Jan 6 at 12:11 PM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:56:09.969582,Vividicci,"Great physical workout, if you let it","This is an awesome VR workout-- if you're not lazy, aka just letting your arms do everything (that'll hurt after a while) but instead, move with your core and legs to  help get your arms where they need to be! I love this for the workout I get. I use 2-4 songs in a row, on advanced, and end up dripping sweat each time and LOVING the challenge, wanting more every time! Two - 3 times a day, a few times a week, and I'm LOSING WEIGHT. RLY. SRSLY. No calorie-counting now.
I'm loving it, but am just hoping they come out with more songs....",Nov 28 at 6:23 PM,4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:56:09.985539,manon.home,Outstanding!!,"This game SAVED my health during the pandemic.  It has become an integral part of my weekly exercise regime and because of it, my cardio has improved tremendously!!  I have tried a few beats games and I find this one to be hand's down the BEST and here is why: 1) Music is customizable. You can use your own music which to me is #1 motivator.  Not only this but there is a beats generator as well, if your busy or lazy like me and don't want to map for hours on end. 2) The environments are just beautiful. No flashy neon colors, or bright backgrounds, this is truly immersivity amazing to be inside.  3) The support provided by the Developers team is phenomenal.  The work really hard at satisfying customers and it shows. 4) The user interface is intuitive and easy to use. It is also very flexible, full of customizable options and they keep improving it!  5) Overall as a workout, it is Awesome. You get almost a great workout with this, especially in terms of cardio and lower body strength.  6) It is pretty ergonomically sound for me, compared to others workouts.  I LOVE it!  Keep up the great work team!",Dec 31 at 10:28 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:56:10.001496,mald55,Really good and hardcore workout game,"It is a lot of fun, and it taxes you to the max. I have't tried custom songs, or unlocked anything other than the fists for some reason, but my family and I have been having a blast. I wonder if in the future I could put controllers on my feet and play that way too. 😁

I find the gaming to be more of a complete workout when compared to Beat Saber or BoxVR. I have tried a couple other fitness games which names I forget, but they were more similar to the two mentioned prior.

All that being said, how is the score calculated on this game, is it about power, accuracy or combo? What has the most weight? I have also noticed that sometimes I have counted a few misses, yet the game says I had 29 or so, which is kinda weird. Is it possible to make the sound the balls make when you pop them louder perphaps, that way it is easier to know if you miss a ball or not? 

Sometimes I have had a hard time telling if I got 20 or 20 x2 if that makes sense. If I feel that in a game like beat saber it is very easy to know if you hit a square or not, as there are very obvious ""hit"" and ""miss"" sounds.","Dec 29, 2020 at 10:08 AM",5, 5,"Hi mald55, thanks for your kind words 😊 They really motivate us! Now, regarding your scoring questions: Biggest contributor to your score is the combo. Your strength will decide whether it’s a full hit or a partial hit and scales the points per hit accordingly. The strength threshold gets higher with increasing difficulty. At the end of each song you also get an activity and strength bonus on top. You can read more about how the game works in our FAQ (www.powerbeatsvr.com/frequently-asked-questions/). Regarding the hit sound: A partial hit has currently a slightly smaller volume, but we are aware that this might be hard to distinguish in certain situations. That’s why we are already playing around with some other hit sounds to make it more clear. Maybe we will switch to a combination of two different hit sounds with different volumes."
2022-05-28 19:56:13.126211,SoZornig,This ain't for casual gamers,"I thought, that i was in shape...couldn't be more wrong.
This game's really gonna make you sweat.

Starts slowly with the Beginner level, but once you choose Intermediate this game is starting to chase you through your living room.
Duck, dodge, dive, box, ropes...it's all in this game.

Many levels and wide range of music genres. Included in beautiful created environments. Additionally you can choose your play style by using bare hands or different weapons. Compare your scores on online leaderboards with other players.

It has also an (really fast working) auto map generator so you can use your favorite tracks for the workout. I've seen nothing comparible in other apps.

And if you still have energy you can create your own maps from scratch with the map builder.

Other games have some of the above features, but this one is the most complete game for working out in VR (Quest release is already announced).","Dec 1, 2020 at 6:21 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 19:56:13.141171,Siber704,Fun fitness!,"This is like BoxVR and Beat Saber combined, so much fun!
Levels are great, music makes you dance and it counts burned calories and how hard you hit. I wish there be more VR games like that!","Dec 15, 2020 at 11:51 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:56:13.156131,Fredi123,I can only use my fist as a weapon !!,"Hello Power Beats VR Team, I own Oculs Quest 2 glasses, bought your training game from Oculus for is graphically the best sports game runs on my PC with Link Kabel oroiginal Quest 2. Unfortunately, I can only use 1 weapon at a time. Although I have always tried A ++ games and different songs, including my own. Didn't help, you still can't see when other weapons are unlocked and how many points you need. You could buy the same software acu on Steam, again 20 euros, whether something changes?
Please help soon!","Dec 29, 2020 at 5:37 AM",3, 0,"Hi Fredi123, sorry for the inconvenience with the weapon unlocking. We've just released an update, that should fix that problem. The progress bar of the next possible weapon as well as the ""Experience Level"" should now change after each song. Level 2 will unlock the second weapon and so forth. Please give it a try and come back to us, if it's still a problem. You can also chat with us on our Discord server if you have further questions: www.discord.gg/powerbeatsvr"
2022-05-28 19:56:13.172089,Insatiable-Me,"The game is nice and all, but...","You can only use fists and there are just 4 stages, I beat them all with A+ score on both intermediate and expert levels.

Weapons are locked, so you can only use fists.

The workout is good and will get you sweating, but the time is a bit under 4 minutes per stage with no way to extend it.

If you are looking for an app that offers and intesive cardio workout, I would highly suggest sticking with Fit XR, as you get more to choose from with longer workouts using about the same body movements for longer period. 

I am giving this a three star rating, as in it's current state the game is underwhelming and lacks heavily in features.","Dec 5, 2020 at 7:44 AM",3, 3,"Hi Insatiable-Me,

thanks for the review. I guess we can help you with some of those aspects you mentioned:

The weapons are only locked in the beginning and will be unlocked by playing. It doesn’t take much time.

You also mentioned that there is no way to extend the workouts. Have you seen the playlist feature? You can easily group several songs into custom playlists, and even mix our official workouts with custom ones using your own music and the auto-generator for longer sessions.

There are also different playlist modes: You can choose between normal mode, endless mode, which stops only when you want to, and endurance mode, which removes the breaks in between songs. You can find the [PLAYLIST] button in the menu on the right-hand side. That should be exactly what you need if you want to have longer workouts. 

And one last point: If you want to crank your workout up, you can do so by using our modifiers in the GAME options or you can scale the in-game playspace up to 3m (9.8ft) if your playspace is large enough.

Please give it a try and let us know, what you think. Thank you!"
