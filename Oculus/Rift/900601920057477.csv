2022-05-28 16:55:51.482502,GrumpySoldier,Hilarious!,"I was initially disappointed by this as it appeared to be a 2D game adapted for VR, but I soon forgot about that 'cause I was too busy laughing. It loads quickly, is great for killing a few minutes, and I play it almost every time I use my Rift.
So much entertainment for so little HDD space. :)","Oct 8, 2017 at 11:40 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:55:51.496465,SuperDupont,"Amazing replay value, full of players!","Being cross-platform, the game is chokeful of players. It is some variant of bomberman, with capture the flag and other modes thrown in. The slightly janky physics play in the fun atmosphere. I played this game way more than I would like to admit and still come back to it a few times a week! Only drawback, no touch as a joypad support. I have emailed the developper about this.","Aug 6, 2017 at 2:57 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:55:51.511425,agamer,Underrated gem!,Bomberman meets super smash bros brawl meets gangbeasts...FUN!,"Oct 4, 2017 at 12:23 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:55:54.661001,Keksmania,One of the MOST fun games,"It's cheap, is multiplayer (crossplatform) and makes a lot of fun. The physics of this game are SUPER SUPER fun and I still have to lose the fun of this game.. I wish more people would play this.. since the release on Oculus Home the dev did a lot of improvements to the game like a queue for rooms and so on!","Dec 26, 2016 at 1:01 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:55:54.674963,damontoo,Amazing game.,"This is such a hugely underrated game. It's similar to that classic ""bomb your opponents"" game except friendly fire is always on and the characters are, well.. clumsy. Flags can be grabbed by multiple people which frequently causes hilarious games of tug-o-war. 

I got this with some of my Oculus store credit and to be honest I might not have tried it otherwise. Now that I've played it though, it's definitely worth picking up. I've played it WAY more than Valkyrie and that game is $60.","Dec 19, 2016 at 7:08 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 16:55:54.689923,tvanderpool9,I freakin love this game,"I have played this game a ton. You might see me around.. I am the reaper.. add me, I need some rift friends! tvanderpool9","Jan 4, 2017 at 10:36 AM",5, 2,
