2022-05-28 20:32:50.414250,MaSsAcReXmAsS,ive been playing for a while,"turning this idea over and over in my head. what if this was a full fledged cinematic game with other aspects exploring ruined space stations, mining for fuel and resources to make weapons and ship upgrades, owning a station that you can operate quests out of in an open world environment and so much more. devs, please get back to me about this. im willing to work on a passion project with you. i see an already beautiful game in the making

edit: Simon, would you consider selling your ip or source code to someone in facebook gaming that wold be intersted in making this more? this idea is like a dormant species of videogame just waiting to be discovered. could be bigger than eve online. by the way i still play this game and despite the lack of content theres huge replay value, i love this so much","Feb 14, 2021 at 8:26 AM",5, 1,"Thanks a lot MassacreXmas,

The game definitely can use more content, but I fear this was a one-time thing. I might start a project in a few years, but as it is right now the development of this game has ended. 

Best, Simon"
