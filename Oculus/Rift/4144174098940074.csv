2022-05-28 20:06:28.757219,eliaslampinen37,only 2D video documentary not VR,"They promise ""long form VR"", but it is not VR, and 20 minutes doesn't sound long. It is just a short well filmed beautiful 360 degrees video document (2D not even 3D and definitely not VR). In 360 degrees video user sees a spherical 2D screen all around, and on that flat surface the video is projected.

The video had music all it's length, but speech can be heard and weakly some natural sounds. The events on the film were interesting. This didn't cause me relevant amount of nausea like 360 degrees videos may do when seen in VR glasses, but then again, turning should be easy to remove from 360 degrees videos while editing them. What comes to velocity, camera seems to have been steady.

Installation probably takes more than 165.9 Mb, since after starting this first time, it will download 8687 Mt more before the video can start. When the program starts for the first time, you might want to save a print screen image, in which case you need to ensure that VR-game is properly visible on main monitor as well. I had some new windows on it opened by ""Komodo"" and concealing information, so I don't know what video player I was asked to install.

I can't rate this high since the description was partially a lie, and also 360 degrees video is not worth much like VR videos and 3D 360 degrees videos are (such as ""Jurassic World: Blue"" and ""Jurassic World: Apatosaurus"" and ""Bear Island"" which (all three) are free).",Dec 5 at 6:28 PM,2, 20,"Hi elias,

Glad you enjoyed the film and thank you for your review, though we feel it is a bit harsh as your rating focusses on the mono 360 part of the video. We have not advertised that it is stereoscopic, but it is full sphere mono (not a normal 2d film as your title might suggest) and in our definition that is a Virtual Reality. We don't feel it is a lie. I think it is how you see the semantics, please also take into acount how much work goes into making a film like this and consider the budgets as an indiemaker as opposed to companies as oculus and then think about the price.  We also have written in the first sentence of the description that it takes 20 minutes, so I think we are pretty clear on it and it is quite long for a 360 documentary. If you enjoyed the experience as a whole maybe you can reconsider your rating or at least call it a monoscopic video in your title instead of 2d. Thank you and best regards, VR Gorilla"
