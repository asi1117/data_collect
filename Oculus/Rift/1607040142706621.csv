2022-05-28 17:49:17.525004,kagalive85,Great concept,"I've only completed the prologue so far, and I've still many stories to listen to but I can already appreciate how amazing this is. Brilliant!","Sep 11, 2020 at 3:54 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:49:17.540961,eurobpm,"Great idea, mediocre implementation","First I love the idea.  Sure you could read someone’s answer but somehow in VR hearing the thoughts and giving them a simple round sphere with eyes to grab is more meaningful.  Why I gave it 3 stars is the UI itself.  I havent found a way while in a chapter to back out of that chapter and go to another, nor have I found a way to load more “thoughts” within a chapter.  It seems you are dependent on the game to determine when you will move on to the next chapter.  It would be great if you could grab more from a tree to listen to and navigate around the UI easier.  That said it was still worth the $9 and a unique way to connect thoughts and feelings in a virtual way.","Feb 24, 2020 at 5:34 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 17:49:17.556918,Piki001,Truly Therapeutic & Thought-provoking,"I was looking for a game that I could just sit in and relax with, a game where I could just enjoy existing in VR, but I was struggling to find something that attracted me.

However, I then saw this game and its premise and I was hooked, hoping the game executed the scope of the idea effectively.

And what a beautifully emotional game it is.

I ended up getting something I valued much more than just a pretty visuals game. Being able to hear different people's truths in such a safe environment and getting the ability to share pieces of your life with a large group of anonymous users that you will never know is surprisingly wonderful. It shows that it doesn't matter who hears you. What's important is that you are heard.

I believe I am the 1248th person to share their thoughts into this game, but I look forward to hearing more thoughts as I am sure to come back and listen to more and more from each chapter.

I did have a few loading issues when giving in my thoughts (30 seconds to 1 minute frozen), but that's a very minimal hitch in what has been a moving experience that has provided me with a good sense of emotional wellbeing.

Thank you Lucas and the development team","Dec 16, 2019 at 10:12 AM",5, 6,Thank you so much for the sweet review <3 I'll work on addressing the hitches.
2022-05-28 17:49:17.571878,zemeron,"Amazing, had me crying my HMD","This was an amazing experience so much so that I find it hard to put into words. The memories shared were moving and powerful but what was more powerful was the thoughts they sparked in myself, the revisiting of my story. I really wish everyone could have this experience.","Apr 27, 2019 at 7:23 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:49:17.586838,Suprix,Most emotional game I have ever played,"This game has really opened my eyes to the possibility of technology. I have never had such an emotional impact from a game before. I felt so much empathy for all of the different thoughts that I listened to and I even felt choked up for some of the thoughts that I recorded. I am going to remember this game forever. Lucas, you did an amazing job.","Jan 10, 2019 at 10:29 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:49:20.710484,gerosan,A simple emotional journey,"This experience allowed me to dig deep and share emotional thoughts throughout my life. The controls were easy to pick up and the audio playback for other recorded thoughts were great. Sometimes thoughts take more than 30 sec to load. Maybe it might have been my internet connection? Regardless, this experience is definitely a memorable one worth sharing and going through again.","Nov 3, 2018 at 10:58 AM",4, 8,"Hey, Gerosan - thanks for the feedback! Can you elaborate on those 30 seconds to load? It should have been playing it immediately, so I would love to understand what happened (and when it happened).

2022-05-28 17:49:20.725444,campfireunion,Refreshing break from VR Gaming,Where Thoughts Go is a journey into vulnerability and meditation.  The ability to listen and share your own thoughts about some of life's important questions while immersed in meditative worlds provides a nice getaway during the hustle and bustle of life.

2022-05-28 17:49:20.755364,Avalin,Cool idea,"This is not something for everyone, but I really liked the idea.
The concept is simple, yet interesting. A lot of it's appeal is the relaxing music, ambience and the fact that VR really enhances the experience a lot. I honestly don't think this had worked outside VR as it would seem not only boring, but not as personal. Also for now it's very short, but with potential new content this could be even more interesting. I'll leave it at 4 stars because as much as I liked the idea, ambience and experience from this, I also found it a tad short for the current price.","Oct 7, 2018 at 7:13 AM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 17:49:23.901948,RushCoil,Short but promising,"I think this app is a great idea. It really is a framework for discovery. It would be pretty amazing if there were hundreds of questions and people used it as a springboard for communicating with people. It could be a great future tool for people who suffer from trauma or social anxiety to begin to trust or learn about other people. It could be a unique way to show that other people are real and have real thoughts and desires, because much of how we experience others these days is through Facebook, text, forums, and message boards. It's easy to label others and forget they are real. You could use something like this to bridge the divide of different subsets of people. There needs to be a way to emulate life before Facebook, and this is a good way to take away the barriers we've put up to protect ourselves. As it stands, I'm sure thousands of hours were spent on it but it is extremely short and anticlimactic. It's also a bit spooky - and sad - that people are pouring out their hearts to some random database somewhere. I was very happy to hear how thoughtful the answers were. Five stars for the concept and possibilities.","Sep 24, 2018 at 6:56 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:49:23.917905,iBrews,"Intimate, emotional, & made for VR","Where Thoughts Go is a community-generated but curated experience that uses the magic of VR to intimately acquaint you with the memories, hopes, and fears of your fellow human beings. While the stories themselves are of course intended as the focal point (and some of them are breathtaking), my favorite element of this is actually the pitch-perfect art and sound design. Even without the stories, these are spaces I would be happy to just exist (maybe even mediatate) in for vast stretches of time. There's so many lovely details-- how you record a thought, how it flies away when you're done, the way thoughts look from chapter to chapter, how a thought rolls away after you've listened to it. Subtle, nuanced, beautiful. 

My only real critiques: 
1) I wish I could pause or restart playback of thoughts-- sometimes I misunderstand someone or someone says something so profound I would just like a moment to take it in. 
2) The privacy policy seen at the beginning (yes I read it) seems to put no limit on the ways the community recordings can be used beyond this experience (maybe even sold to third-parties). Just be aware of this, and hopefully it doesn't scare you off from participating.

In a VR world full of first person shooters, ultra competitive leaderboards, and experiences that seem like no more than a VR port of a 2D game, it's wonderful and refreshing to see something like this that's tailor-made for the medium and seems to have a primary goal of reminding us of our humanity and bringing us together. 

More of this, please.","Nov 9, 2018 at 12:30 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 17:49:23.932865,RuneSR2,Not very interesting,"Seems like the devs left it to the buyers of this app to make the content. I wasn't inspired by the stories I heard, many seemed quite common. I'd prefer for the devs to find some special and awesome examples to provide truly extraordinary inspiration. This feels more like a radio show where you really don't need VR. Performance wasn't impressive too, seemed to slightly stutter using super-sampling 2.0 although not much is going on. This is early access, for now I'll have to ask for a refund, I did not enjoy this app, sadly.","Aug 15, 2018 at 2:27 AM",2, 3,"Hey, Rune! Agreed on the performance improvements, we fixed them in an update! This is why we release this stuff on Early Access :)

As for people creating the content, that's the whole point. We wanted the app to be a truthful representation of humanity."
2022-05-28 17:49:23.947825,BrightSummer,A Necessary Experience,"Where Thoughts Go is so incredibly hard to describe, especially since you will get an entirely different experience than mine, but that's just the beauty of it. Though I can guarantee whatever experience you may have, will be a worthwhile one.

I've never felt like I had a clearer understanding of people, and I almost felt this was a tool of education at one point simply because it was so eye opening. I relaxed, I laughed, and I cried, all in one sitting - strictly because I finally had a chance to realize my answers to the toughest questions are often the same as everyone elses. It's hearing everyone elses though; that's the magical part.

Where Thoughts Go is not the same as picking up a movie to relax or getting a game to play, it's about having an experience that you didn't know you needed.","Jun 1, 2018 at 7:24 AM",5, 23,"Thank you. Feedback like this makes all the hard work worthwhile.

2022-05-28 17:49:23.962785,Razzydude,Absolutely wonderous,"This social expirement opens your eyes to the lives and philosophies of people across the world in an empathetically gripping experience. Beyond it's intrigue are stories that can both uplift the soul, and break your heart, allowing you to leave something behind to inspire or teach others. And that's absolutely amazing.","Jul 7, 2018 at 5:03 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 17:49:27.072468,sinoth,An insightful meditation and reflection,"Such a unique experience -- well worth the asking price. Each question that is asked of you gets teased out by the answers of others. I found myself approaching my response differently as I sifted through voices of those that came before me. This ""passive multiplayer"" is an interesting way to connect with strangers in a safe way while still evoking intimacy.

The first playthrough is a powerful tool for self-examination. Don't rush it. This experience is best played alone and with plenty of time to ruminate.","Jun 7, 2018 at 9:30 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:49:27.087428,mgzhang,The Best VR Emotional Experience Yet,"In a space in which most VR applications are purely entertaining videogames, Where Thoughts Go is a phenomenal example of an truly intimate and emotional VR experience. I was skeptical of whether or not VR could actually be a tool for empathy, but this changed my entire perspective. 

From the soothing soundtrack to the intriguing thoughts, this game can bring out the entire spectrum of your emotions if you take the time to listen and reflect.  I laughed. I cried. I learned life advice from people that I would otherwise never hear. 

This is the best VR emotional experience I've tried yet, and I want to say props to the entire Where Thoughts Go team!","Jun 12, 2018 at 10:21 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 17:49:30.205089,famousaj,well done!,"Very well thought out experience. New questions will always have users coming back. Hopefully the trolls keep away. The only thing I would add is the ability to sit and be able to touch the ""orbs"". SInce the game recommends you relax , having to stand for an extended period is not that great. If sitting isn't the best option, maybe we could just have an option to point at the ""orbs"" from a distance and activate them. Graphics and scenery could be better, however that might distract some users.","Jun 4, 2018 at 1:46 AM",5, 1,"Thank you for the wonderful feedback! The experience was actually designed for sitting, but can be played in any way - most elements of the piece adjust their own height automatically based on your initial height when you start. Did that not work for you?

We were working on a mechanic that allows you to grab objects from a distance. What do you think? We're usually against pointers since we want you to physically interact with the orbs :)

Keep the feedback coming!
