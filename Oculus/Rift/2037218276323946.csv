As mentioned in previous review, it needlessly pauses at every step of tutorial and forces you to totally restart the tutorial if you do not complete it.  As an added bonus, every time the tutorial pauses on my system, the environment starts to rotate so that at the last pause, it resumes with everything rotated 90 degress, causing me to crash almost instantly.  It is stuck in this loop, and I cannot experience the game.    The develper needs to provide an update.  I really would like to try this game, as it has potential.","Feb 1, 2020 at 9:27 PM",2, 4,

This game starts with a tutorial that is poorly designed. It doesn't actually teach you how to fly the glider, it just tells you that you need to collect the big glowing green balls. Most of us likely could have figured that out on our own. Flying the glider is easy enough to figure out just by trying to do it. It would take some getting used to for sure, but it's not rocket science. 
Unfortunately mistakes seem to be punished pretty harshly. There is about 45 seconds of talking before you are allowed to take control of the glider. Perhaps that's not a lot the first time, but the second through twentieth time it might as well be eternal. I didn't want to listen to it the first time, but evey time you miss a ball, or crash or do anything other than exactly what they want you to do, it just resets the tutorial and you have to listen again. 
Another thing that bothered me was the way it stopped the game after you got the ball to tell you that you needed to get the second ball. You have to freeze your hands while that is happening because their position is what tells the glider where to go. If I didn't need to be told about the first one, I sure didn't need to be told about the second. The third at least does something new and the explanation there is kind of important I guess, but I also would have just figured it out when I flew through it. But I never got to do that because when it stops the game to tell me about the balls it throws me off and I just didn't want to hear that intro again. 
Lastly, the gliding made me feel sick to my stomach. Aside from that it seemed like it could have been a fun time for a little while. 
Oh, one more thing, for some reason the controllers are tracked, but you don't have hands in the game. You're just a hang glider.","Feb 9, 2019 at 12:20 AM",3, 17,

My Quick Thoughts:
Mediocre graphics, terrible controls and a no control tutorial makes for a very frustrating experience.","Feb 9, 2019 at 9:46 PM",1, 4,
