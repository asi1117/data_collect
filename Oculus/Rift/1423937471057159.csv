i see you didnt read in my post i said ""no touch controllers in hand show in game. i hit right menu button and in my home my hands show and work perfect""
tells me you dont even read and have a copy and paste reply. i have touch controllers and they dont work in your game. with your game loaded i can back out with menu button and see my hands just fine. they dont show in your game. glad i got this for FREE. my rating will stay at a 1 and uninstall. i aways give a decent review and this one just got my final
--------Update 4/16/20 -------------------
i seen replys saing the touch controlles where fixed. nope you enter your name and stuck. you made it work to enter your name and cant even play. i give this 0 stars if i could. this has to be the worst game on oculus. i have never had a game that you cant even start","Apr 16, 2020 at 4:10 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:45:58.570457,HeyJesseAe,Not recommended!,Game does not recognize touch controllers or allow player to progress past main menu. Gameplay looks lackluster based on trailer and content available for menu. Feels very much like a side-project.,"Jan 21, 2018 at 11:01 AM",1, 1,I fixed the bugs and update new version. Thank you.

2022-05-28 19:46:01.697214,FastLawyer,"It works and it's free, so 2 stars","I can't really recommend this title.  It's a boring gallery shooter.  Fast animals are thrown and you're supposed to shoot them as they whiz on by.  I was #3 on the leaderboards after three attempts.  Too bored to try to go for #1.  If you don't have any money and have a lot of time on your hands and need more VR stuff, I guess download it as long as it's free.  Otherwise, not worth it.","Dec 17, 2017 at 6:30 AM",2, 0,"Thank you for playing Oh my cooking gun and your review!
