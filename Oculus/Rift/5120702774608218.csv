The horror/monster theme of this bar and restaurant simulator is a pretty fun twist on the genre.  I will say there are some bugs that still need to be squashed, but they're minor enough that it isn't game breaking, just slightly annoying when it happens.  If you like cooking sims you'll probably have a lot of fun with this game.",Apr 30 at 8:17 AM,4, 0,Hi there. Much appreciated your feedback.
