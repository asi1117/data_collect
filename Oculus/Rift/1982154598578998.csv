My Quick Thoughts:
A very polished and colorful wave shooter with great mechanics and addictive gameplay.
A lot of wave shooters in VR are just generic attempts at making a VR game. 
D*** Wilde 2 already has a pedigree and takes all the best elements from it's previous game and builds on it. Great visuals, combat and sound design give this game a genuine arcade feeling.
I also loved the fact that you are now on a raft moving through the levels.","Mar 14, 2019 at 10:41 PM",4, 13,
