This is basically how they increase the difficulty setting in the game while also stacking the board in your oppoenents favour to start with.  On the hard setting your opponent starts out with 6 extra armies.  Also, if you are attacking a tile or being attacked with equal number of armies, your odds of winning are only 45 percent.  You can control the skirmish, which will allow you to win, but if there are two tiles under attack at one time, the skirmish only counts for one of the tiles, while the second tile is decided by a random outcome, where your odds of winning are always under 50 percent.  So basically it becomes frustrating and impossible.  There seems to be little strategy involved with most outcomes decided by luck of the dice...not worth the money.  By the time you play enough to realise you wasted your money, it's too late to get the refund.","Jan 7, 2018 at 3:26 PM",2, 49,
