2022-05-28 20:59:47.614624,peter_papaya,Oh Wonder!,"Full disclosure: I'm the guy that attended Tempest 90 times. I love this game.

The multiplayer in the under presents is art. Anonymous strangers in a sandbox environment with secrets to discover. It turns out that the natural interaction without a way to speak is to show or be shown a secret. The transition from being the one being shown the secrets to the one showing the secrets is insidiously gradual. At a certain point, you can no longer distinguish between playing the game and being the game.","Feb 19, 2021 at 1:50 AM",5, 17,

2022-05-28 20:59:50.750237,gibbelst,this is extremely cool,"just an entirely new idea and experience that works really well, which is surprising for such a new concept","Dec 17, 2020 at 7:46 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:59:50.765197,JimHardware,A fantastic use of VR,"Interactive theater/art preformance/game. Yes there is alot of slashes in there. The  Under mixes and uses the tools they have to create a truly new, innovative and touching experiance, well worth the money and I look forward to doing it again before the month is over. I truly hope these guys and gals make enough or enjoy doing it enough that we get more. Amazing, 5/5 (don't be overwhelmed, you as a patron don't have to and can't talk over the mic, only the actors can, they will direct and cast you as the experience happens!)","Sep 14, 2020 at 2:49 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:59:50.781155,THISGAMESDEV,DONT PAY FOR IT JUST PLAY THE DEMO,What the demo is and what you pay for is completely differant. the demo show off this amazing immersive mind bending experience and puzles with crazy portals. then you buy a ticket and its one proformer that makes you act out jank roles. Way too much story and Way too long just sanding around doing things you were not exspecting to do coming from the demo. Very Poory put togeather.,"Oct 4, 2020 at 5:00 PM",2, 4,"Hi there! If you enjoyed the puzzles featured in the game demo over live actor interaction, I would recommend The Under's Timeboat, which features more time-loop puzzles throughout the story!"
2022-05-28 20:59:50.800104,Luagha,My fondest VR memory since 2015.,"Having just finished a session of The Tempest (and passing through a spontaneous actor interaction on the way), i've now had the closest experience yet to what i've been dreaming of since reading Dream Park. Thanks Tendar.","Sep 12, 2020 at 9:57 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:59:50.819053,RuneSR2,"Strange game, really bad graphics","This seems to be a creative game, but to me it felt more weird and disconnected than fun. Note that I've only tested the single player story.
Graphics are extremely poor with no real textures and limited lighting, it does not feel like PCVR - but this is a Quest port, and it feels exactly like that. 
The game is not 90 fps ss 2.0 using my GTX 1080 indicating very poor optimization. Clearly this game should perform at solid 90 fps ss 2.0 using the Rift CV1 (like much more demanding games do - for example Transference, Vacation Simulator, Pistol Whip etc). Even colored surfaces with no textures greatly enhance the SDE, devs should avoid such surfaces and use high-res textures and proper lighting.
Controls are mediocre too, no smooth turning, can't choose sitting or standing. I fail to understand why many have awarded this lower-than-mediocre game many 5 stars ratings. This game is not - by far or by any measure - Lone Echo quality. I have just given the game a second try, but ended up uninstalling it again.","Aug 2, 2020 at 7:31 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 20:59:53.941701,parker.pierce,A movie with a Dungeon Master...,"blending a live actor with interactive props, dynamic location changes, a clear outline of where to take the audience, and the random nature of other audience members is FANTASTIC!! I can really see this sort of thing having a lot of potential for growth, and it's already starting out rather strong. It bypasses the predictable nature of pre-recorded npcs in games and the narrative breaking side of real players. Things like this prove that VR can effectively extend roleplay stuff to greater ranges. Worth every penny, and please PLEASE keep doing more of what you're doing!","Jul 22, 2020 at 10:43 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:59:53.955664,BukarooBanzai,Very Unique,"Ok, this is a live interactive play. It's a shortened version of ""The Tempest"" and it is fantastic. If you are missing the theatre experience, this gives you that and then some. Worth every fricken penny. The actress that lead my group was amazing, but if they could get a big name to headline a perfomance now and then, they could charge alot heavier and it would totally be worth it. This is one of the best quarantine activities I've found yet, more please. Can't wait to do the second one.","Jul 21, 2020 at 11:19 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:59:53.969626,Hanover,Solo Players Skip This,"At first I really liked this.  Then I kept discovering areas I'd never be able to see because it requires more than one person to get in.  There's a big under-ground area and I found the door to get in.  Unfortunately it seems like the only way to get in is if one of the actors lets you in.  This happened to me once, unfortunately the game glitched and I ended up falling through the game world when I followed the actor through the tunnel.  Very frustrating.  Please let solo players get into these areas.","Aug 2, 2020 at 9:33 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 20:59:53.984587,Baglunch,Bought a ticket for my wife...,"...but the actor was invisible!! No story teller, no prospero, only the other guests who were clearly looking at him. Both my wife and I, professional actors of several decades, were very disappointed. I want my money back.

edit: Thank you for the coupon for a free show. I have upped my review to 3 stars and will re-evaluate Tempest following my next viewing.","Jul 24, 2020 at 3:16 AM",3, 1,"Hey!

2022-05-28 20:59:53.999546,taquitobuddy,If you are looking for something weird,"After playing this for an hour or so I still had no idea what was going on.  It seems  the main part of the ""game"" is to watch (and maybe influence?  no idea) a movie kinda like Invisible Hours.  But there's also a bunch of places outside the movie to explore.  Somehow I got a map, then it disappeared.  Anyway, all the voice acting was top notch but the entire experience was extremely confusing and I don't like the weird teleport movement (made me slightly sick after awhile).  If you want to explore a very different kind of game (or loved the Invisible Hours) that doesn't tell you what's happening, this one might be for you.  I'd have preferred an (optional) tutorial or narration or something that at least explained the basics, and also the option to teleport move without the distortion.  Great voice acting all-around though.","Apr 12, 2020 at 4:27 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 20:59:57.103245,Inaros,Why is no one talking about this?,"This is truly a gem of a game. The closest comparison I could draw would be The Return of the Obra Dinn, but that does this game a great diservice. This game is an untapped well of creativity and imagination; and is one of the most incredibly unique experiences I've ever had in any video game. Look; I've played hundreds of games in my life, and only a precious handful of those games were as immediatley enthralling and special in the way that The Under Presents is. You owe it to yourself to give this game a shot.","Jan 20, 2020 at 3:33 AM",5, 28,
2022-05-28 20:59:57.117208,D-_-RAiL,Spun out of control fun.,A fantastic twisted adventure that sends you down the rabbit hole and drops you into a mud pile of LSD. If you are a person that is looking for unique experiences than this title is for you.  I found their take on the lite social aspects of the game very intriguing. I think it's a title worth trying if you are a VR experience addict like myself and collecting them all like Pokemon. If you are looking for a pew pew than this is not for you. This is a really risky title and I hope you guys support them so that they  can continue to make more unique experiences for us.  9.0 out of 10. Fantastic. Rift S.,"Dec 20, 2019 at 12:53 PM",5, 27,
2022-05-28 20:59:57.131170,skullthug,INSANELY CREATIVE,"Everything around this concept is really well thought out and weird & wild as hell. I never thought just traveling to the equivalent of the 'menu screen' in this game could be one of my favorite moments in VR ever.
I absolute adore the rotating theater shows, and the live actor component has definitely given me some very bizarre stories to tell (Like me helping a tiny talking skeleton get married in Stonehenge).
I would gladly buy this game 3 times if it would help Tender Claws keep pushing the boundaries of art and VR like this.","Jan 12, 2020 at 3:24 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:59:57.146130,Chrome2,Fantastic experience,"This game is excellent. The world is creative and loaded with hidden secrets. There are laws to the world, and you have to figure out how it all works, preferably, with the help of others.

The host is amazing and the shows are fantastic. If you're lucky you will catch a live performance!","Jan 13, 2020 at 7:16 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:59:57.160093,latearrival,Innovative and intriguing,"I have absolutely no idea of what's going on but I love it!

It's an intriguing mash-up of a puzzle game, the Invisible Hours (complete with great acting), quirky cabaret and voiceless multiplayer interactions.

It's a wonderful use of VR and a must-buy if your gaming tastes extend beyond shooting stuff. 

Hats off to the devs for trying something so 'out there' - they deserve our cash.

One suggestion for the devs: When in the Time Boat story, it'd be great if there was a way to speed-up/reverse time while in first person mode (without going into diaroma mode).","Jan 28, 2020 at 4:53 AM",5, 2,

Update! I got a very quick response from the devs and they helped me figure out the issue. Thanks for the help AND quick response!!!

For anyone having sound issues. I had my audio set to play out of my rift and through my comp speakers. The devs told me to set it to the rift headphones....and it worked perfectly.","Dec 22, 2019 at 5:10 AM",5, 6,"Hi, sorry to hear you're having audio issues.
