2022-05-28 15:48:01.037450,goesBang,Not that much fun...,"First: The song selection is great, not too one-dimensional like in Beat Saber or very restricted like in Dance Collider! Also the environments, I like them.

But that was it...
I didn't have very much fun. It felt more like: Just go through all remaining songs and then deinstall. In Beat Saber you know exactly what you have done wrong and where you can improve - even the same song has a high replay value with a high skill ceiling, especially up to Expert+. 
It's different for this game. You don't know, if you should jab at the incoming balls or just waggle around, if you should put your strange ""light bulbs"" through the marked holes in the semi-transparent wall before your eyes or just put your whole arm through it and again - just waggling the bulbs around.
There is no explanation.

The waggling-around factor is high, because you have no left-right differentiation for balls and ""bulbs"".

This wall before your eyes is just to near at the face...the points and hints are just directly before your nose and you cannot really read them with the Rift S.
The game might be a bit different on head sets with a wider FOV like Pimax or Index - I'm sure the game is much much easier on such head sets when the balls are coming left and right, with the Rift S you are flying half-blind in this moments.

Beat Saber or Dance Collider or even Box VR are much better...just the songs are great.","Oct 23, 2019 at 1:36 PM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 15:48:01.052410,Detumaki,"Poorly done ""Rythym"" game","Bad accuracy and frankly a very non-rythymic ""Rythym"" game. I could count over a dozen better ones I've downloaded the last year. It's like music boxing. Without strategy, accuracy, sense, or any hint of actual effort required. 

Just waiting for that perfect music boxing game?

2022-05-28 15:48:01.068367,chessdude,Not a rhythym game,"I'm a big fan of games like Dance Dance Revolution, and more recently Beat Saber. But you're not dancing for this- you barely move, and the design encourages you to keep your arms close and nearly stationary. I also didn't recognize any of the music, with no way to get new songs. Even getting this on sale feels like wasted money.","Apr 24, 2019 at 10:56 AM",1, 13,

I'm not sure if this is new or if it was always there but it annoys me beyond repair.  I want to get rid of that curtain and certainly of the even more annoying texts that appear on it.  It's too close to your face and it distracts from the objects you're supposed to hit.  So, either the curtain and all of its annoying artifacts can be turned off in some menu or this is it.  Too bad because I enjoyed the music a lot in this game.","Mar 7, 2019 at 7:47 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 15:48:04.200989,HisRoyalMajestyM,Annoying!,"There is no explanation if I should hit the things, just hold sticks and let the notes hit them? Do I hit it at the curtain, in front of it? I can just stick my hand past it and let the notes hit it and it's all good anyways. It just isn't satysfying. Could've at least add some kind of sparks as you hit depending on the swing. I swing harder, more sparks are flying or Superhot way, make them shatter with a satysfying sound or something, it's all just meh. Annoyed the crap out of me, didn't play since I purchased, which was 9 months ago! probably won't ever again. Its just crap.","Jan 19, 2019 at 9:33 PM",1, 5,

This ""game"" is BORING!!! Steam has a better alternative - Audioshield, and it's 2 times cheaper than this ""game"". After Audioshield I was sweating as ****, and here I was like ""meh..."".

2022-05-28 15:48:07.363530,prosaicpudding,"Awesome rythm game, a little easy","If you like rythm games, you'll have some fun with this one. The music is pretty good and the controls are easy to pick up. However, It's pretty easy to get A rank in most songs (even ones listed as ""hard"") if you have some rythm game experience. Even S rank doesn't take that much skill to achieve for most songs. If they either added more difficult songs, or another level of challenge mode for existing songs it would go a long way to extending the playtime on this one for me. That said, I've sunk quite a few hours into this one, and am still playing. Hoping for some DLC to buy, because ultimately, this is the best VR rythm experience I've seen out there.

PROS:
*Fun, high quality beat maps   
*Great music (it'll be stuck in your head all day   
*Controls feel natural   
*Reliable/polished compared to other VR rythm games I've tried (Holodance, Airtone)   
*Nice looking environments   

CONS:
*Could use more songs and environments   
*Occasional lag spikes (pretty rare but very frustrating, although this may be because my rig is low end)   
*No notification when you beat your high score   
*No recording feature built in   
*Does not save view resets, meaning you have to set it each time you turn on the game.","Jan 9, 2018 at 10:58 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:48:07.378490,Katostrofik,"Great game, great value!","I picked this game up during the anniverasry flash sale and it's been a lot more fun than I expected! As with most VR games, it takes a little bit of learning at first, but once you know when to bop the little flying sphere things and get some of the mechanics down, you'll likely have a blast with the selection of songs it has to offer. Trying to get those S-grade scores is challenging, but one by one I'm getting them!

I can't give 5 stars because there are a few little annoyances to keep it from being 'perfect'. One of which is that when you're on the home screen previewing songs, the background music doesn't even stop. They just play the song preview REALLY loudly to try and cover it up or something. 

As with any rhythm game, more songs would be awesome, but as is it's totally worth the price if you like this genre!","Dec 9, 2017 at 5:06 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:48:07.393450,cheesenachos12,So much fun!,"If you like games like Geometry Dash, this is great!  I wouldn't have minded a few more songs, but the ones that are there are really original and great.","Feb 2, 2018 at 8:59 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:48:07.408410,lovemyuns,Adults and kids love it,"Got this game on sale since the reviews are great! I am loving it!! Honestly it isn't my type of music but when you listen to the music while playing the game, it all fits together perfectly. My son, 12, loves to play this also. There are a couple different settings where your character will be located and about 40 songs to choose from. The songs range from easy to hard. The controllers become glow rods that you use to catch glowing rays coming your way. The harder the song- the more rays will be coming. Some of them are very high up! You will feel happy and excited when you are playing... there is just no way not to! After each song you are rated A-F and get a number score and you can see how you fare against others globally. Loading is minimal, a very easy game to pick up and go. Basically no learning curve either.","Dec 8, 2017 at 3:51 AM",5, 3,We are so happy to see you and your boy enjoy the game!

This game is awesome. Other games like it are OK, but Beats Fever is designed to better fit its songs, has a good curation of music, and really gets you into the gameplay.

Just choose a song, find your rhythm to it, and go nuts.

My only request would be to see more songs in the future, including, perhaps, the ability for people to make and submit songs for others to play.","Oct 25, 2017 at 12:00 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:48:10.552002,Galaxy_Invader9,started out 4/5 but now needs options,"I love this game, It's a fun time and has a old school ddr feel(at least fever mode songs do)
The menus are alright, though I'd suggest adding the capability of using the analog stick and A button to navigate (lots of accidental button presses with the wands) Gameplay is fun, and can be a bit of a challenge if youaren't quick moving your hands. maybe not as challenge as audioshield, though I couldn't say as I haven't played it. The visuals are really nice, though you don't have a whole lotta time to look around seeing as you have to pay attention, ands hit the bubbles, but this is where I end up having my criticism, During the last update they seem to have changed the blueish bubbles to green or red arrows, which unfortunately makes the game pretty much unplayable for me as the arrows now blend into the enviroment. mind you for normal people this may not be a problem, but those with certain eye issues may have trouble viewing the new notes.
I'd suggest a small options menu where the player could choose the shape, and color of the notes, which would make it so even those with issues could select a note that they could see. If you're not visually impaired and want a fun rhythm game, this is probably for you. I'll have to wait for an update so that I can oncve again have fun with this awesome game.","Sep 11, 2017 at 10:16 AM",3, 3,"Hi, Thank you so much for the comment. Just let you know that the color changes of the bubbles(""beats"") is only for special festival events. The color of them will turn back to normal blue state when the festivals ended.

I want to touch!"" Then this works. There's no gameplay here. Touch what's coming at you. There's nothing to learn. Hardest difficulty does nothing new. If you're someone who likes rythm games or enjoys playing Dragonforce on expert on Guitar Hero then stay away. There is a game for us and it's called ""Airtone"". Get it.

2022-05-28 15:48:13.685621,MervinRae,A bit mixed feelings,"It looks nice and from the rhythm gameplay I like it more then Audioshield. The music is a bit generic even if 40 songs is a good amount per se. The gameplay does not feel as satisfying like in Airtone. Hitting the orbs feels a bit empty. It would be nice if the hitted orbs would make a fitting noise to the music (so you can hear your own rhythm, like in Airtone) and different orbs for different instruments would be nice too. As it is you never know which rhythm to follow when orbs are incoming. The worst thing is the amount of orbs that does come from time to time. That is chaos pure and you do not hit the orbs anymore but try to ""touch"" them chaoticly. When one instrument is playing, like a spanish guitar or a piano, then it feels like a rhythm game and quite satisfactory but the change of rhythm while the orbs stay the same and from time to time this really chaotic mess of orbs throws the game back. I give it 3-4 stars - rated with 4 cause of the young medium and the hope the game will improve further over time. It has great potential and it could become the best music game next to airtone with the advantage that it is more western oriented as Airtone is completly anime and nippon pop oriented. Still, I did like Beats Fever more then Audioshield and Holodance.","Jul 2, 2017 at 1:20 AM",4, 2,

What does matter is that you start bopping spheres to the beat and find yourself dancing along with it. There's no immediate penalty for missing and instead of getting frustrated I found myself smiling and laughing.

Basically it's a touch rhythm game and can get your heart rate up a bit on harder levels - can make a nice low impact workout. To the smug trash talking about fake reviews - this is a real review - learn what a rhythm game is before making lame comments like you want to interact with the light. What does that even mean? Man what a dolt. Anyways the game is exactly like the video you see for it - and it's very fun. Now if Sega would make a Samba de Amigo I'd be, well, very happy.","Mar 30, 2017 at 2:21 PM",5, 10,

I can't give it 5 stars, though.  I think it needs a wider song selection and a different 'difficulty' selection setup.  The 4 song menus are really just 2 menus and then a second set with more difficult versions of them.
