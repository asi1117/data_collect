Nothing special nothing new

2022-05-28 15:38:59.148765,Pugz1ey,,This was a really fun game.  It would be much better with more people in multiplayer or maybe a battle royal mode or possible a few new maps.  All in all though I had a great time playing.,"Sep 27, 2020 at 12:09 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:38:59.162728,GRANATA,,"Game is  cool. Postapocalyptic death race. Carmagedon in VR.  But developers not very social.  Completely ignores players and their comments. What's wrong with you? Narcissism? There is something in the game yet to fix, but for you not interesting.  Keep it up, great guys. :D  For game 4 stars. For developers

2022-05-28 15:38:59.177687,SAAM_i_AM,"For Love of God Devs, Please LISTEN!","First and foremost, F@$%ing A!! This game is set for some stupid fun multiplayer mayhem!! Smooth movements to all but eleminate car sickness.. Well, not all car sickness is gone, because all the cars in this game are pure sickness!! 10x Awesome weapons, great speed boosts, funny voice narratives. BTW, I love the flaming skull on menu.. This game is a definate Occulus essential and should develop into a truley epic title.  Great time killer single player and the multiplayer.. well lets just say .. ""F poker night boys.. lets roll out and blow some sh@#t up!!"". I love this game already. BUT.. and its a big BUT.. These guys made a fatal mistake and It is a deal breaker for me, its the most frustrating, annoying and game ruining setup in any game. Hopefully the Devs will read this and fix it . And to be fair to the publisher and all parties. I will not play this awesome beast of a game again until the issue is changed or I am given a refund. As of now I have 30 min playtime. 
That was all I needed to know how epic this game is!! 
So Devs... PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND GAMERS ALIKE.. PLEASE LISTEN!
oK. oK. ENOUGH RAMBLING SAAM. WHATS THE ISSUE?
 You cant have the ""recenter view"" button on the dang stick you steer with!! Very Very bad things happen when, in the heat of battle, executing a power drift and boosting, your thumb mashes the steering hard left or right AND DEPRESSES THE DANG RECENTER VIEW BUTTON BY PROXY!  I know Im not the only gamer THIS HAPPENS TO.. Why would you put the ""center view"" button on the same stick you are steering with?? go ahead and do a powerslide while boosting and click the steering thumbstick and see what happens. hELLO WALL!
Please no kind advice like ""try not to press so hard on  thumbstick while steering"", because this is Death Lap.. not Driving Miss Daisy ok..  Map ""center view"" to the ""Y"" button or give us a way to disable it. PLEASE.","Dec 6, 2019 at 3:20 PM",5, 168,
2022-05-28 15:39:02.298341,ZnarF59,Need wheel!,"Please add steering wheel as controller ! 
The game is really fun, if needing some polish, but my G29 is begging to get enabled!
Do not make steering wheels cry!","Jan 16, 2020 at 2:34 AM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 15:39:02.314298,KhanCity,Mario Cart and Twisted Metal,"Whaaaaat, this is amazing!!! put 3 hours in first time trying.  Controls feel great, gameplay is fast paced, level designs keep you coming back for more.  Multiplayer is too much fun.  Make sure to go through tutorials 1st in order to get ""up to speed"" with the competition.  Set it to INTENSE mode if you got VR legs, the best way to play.  This should set a standard to all VR cart games releasing in the future.  Great Job Devs!!!","Dec 6, 2019 at 12:58 PM",5, 24,
2022-05-28 15:39:02.332251,Vince502,,"The game is fun, and doesnt make me motion sick. As of right now there are definatley things that could be touched up on, like the enemies automatically catch up to you, and that they are unaffectedby obstacles and they go through walls. There are more problems and I hope they continue to put work in the game but it is very fun","Dec 23, 2019 at 6:20 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:39:02.355189,Tricky2U,"If your thinking ""Twisted Metal"" - NOPE!","- Game is OK not as good as the Trailer makes it out to be.  I was expecting more and got less.  $19.99 only 5 Tracks, Hmm and it's a mix bag graphic wise 2D, 3D, Holograms, Lazer Beams, Neon and Cartoony.  
 
- I didn't have any VR motion sickness.  But I sure do question why the 3rd Person view looks better than 1st Person does.

- Takes a toll on your controllers if you drive w/thum sticks.  Simple steering and weapons deployment is GOOD. 

-It's ENJOYABLE, certainly worthy for any Mad MAX fan!","Dec 8, 2019 at 3:53 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:39:02.370149,Dr.evilman,amazing game,"Let Be Honest If your after a racing gaming get this one it legit,
Its like mario kart, twisted metal and a couple of other games 
what it could use 
a last man standing mode 
more levels 
customizeable cars and build your own mode 
more music 
and custom map download with a pvp modes 
and this game is a aaa tittle its already really good and ive spent most of my time on the quest and i love the game, the devlevopers have done a outstanding job,
and i cann amny updates coming and i offer up all my tracks from soundcloud just look up dr.evilman.... so to end this review i got to say please go out and get this game its a must have on vr and it has cross play so you get a copy on pc and the quest which is great......","Dec 28, 2019 at 5:53 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:39:05.476839,ShineHunter,Fun to play with friends!,"See my 1st impressions here https://youtu.be/Yh77h9Xfi3Y
This is Mario Kart meets Twisted metal in style.  
Graphically it's OK, but it's also was made for the Quest and it is crossbuy. Explosions are great. 
Pickups are many and fun to use. 
Gameplay is so much fun. Play online. Not sure it's crossplay. 
Only issue I felt it had was killing people or being killed is just way to easy.","Dec 6, 2019 at 8:12 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:39:05.490802,Faya_Moonshadow,Lots of potential,"This has a lot of potential but feels really incomplete. Camera issues aside, there is nowhere enough content. The racing and battling are super fun and the tracks are spectacular but I need more. Not enough tracks, not enough cars, not enough weapons, barely anything to unlock, nothing to customize, nothing to upgrade... I would have given this 5 stars no problem if we got half of what i just mentioned. This feels like a short demo/proof of concept for a brilliant game.","Dec 12, 2019 at 9:24 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:39:05.505762,shane_powell,Ok but not as good as review say,"I brought this based on the praise from other reviews. Its ok but feels a bit low budget and shallow.  The graphics are ok and the controls work well. I did not feel any motion sickness on intense mode. I did not find the AI much of a challenge.

Its a good enough game for the price but I would rather pay more for something a bit more fleshed out.

You need to set the game to intense mode for it to be played on a wired headset otherwise you will tie yourself up.  There also needs to be an option to turn off the annoncer as they say the same line multiple times in a row and it gets annoying.","Dec 19, 2019 at 6:07 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:39:05.520722,adam.poole.313,Mario cart meets Mad Max,Great racing game.  At times the graphics do seem really watered down though. My only real complaint with the game is that there should be more options on how easy it is to destroy a car or different modes that make it more significant when a car is destroyed. Its a little tiring when I destroy the same vehicle 10 times in one race. Makes destruction less satisfying.,"Dec 8, 2019 at 2:34 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:39:05.535682,JOculusAccount,Solid game mechanics.,"Very well put together controls. Interaction is pretty flawless apart from issues where each time you explode the head angle resets to whatever direction you are looking, so you often end up driving sideways. The maps are fun and well thought out though they feel a bit empty. I think if we could get an update with something like the pedestrians in Carmaggedon or maybe some cannon fodder NPC racers too.","Dec 7, 2019 at 7:32 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:08.649354,Matrix_Man,My game of the year,"Easily my favorite game I have played this year and I have played them all.  
In fact I think it's in my top 5 best vr games ever released.  Please continue to support this game.","Jan 2, 2020 at 8:25 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:39:08.664314,superpozition,The review  below,"Omg dude (epic fail review below mine). Just get to the point. You spent 20 mins talking about how you’re going to talk about something, then we lose all context about what you’re saying by the time we actually get to it. No one wants to invest their entire night into reading this crap. Just say “don’t put the re center view on the thumb stick. For the love. 

Yes I agree with him. But the game is rad. You should all buy it.","Dec 11, 2019 at 1:56 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:39:08.678277,evandiazz,Try this out.,"One of my favorite racing/combat games for VR. The gameplay is really fun, though the graphics could be better. I do wish it was a little more difficult to eliminate other players/cars.

Otherwise, very fun.","Dec 17, 2019 at 5:02 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:39:11.836830,mrdig,Fun but netcode needs work,"I'm going to say that this game is plain fun! And I was very hyped for it. It DOES meet my expectations when playing offline, but online is a bit weird. I saw a couple of glitches happen, like cars appearing and disappearing, this only happened about 2/3 times in about an hour long online session. This game has TON of potential and it's super fun. I'd recommend you to buy it solely for having a blast doing solo gameplay. If the Devs fix the netcode a bit, this game could easily be a 5 star game for me, but it was a bit of let down, it just didn't feel 'right' online.","Dec 9, 2019 at 10:29 AM",3, 0,

Please dev's I hope someday you will add steering wheel support! Also customizable weapons! One more thing I would love to see is a demolition derby, imagine a multiplayer free for all! Do that and you will have a winner!","Dec 9, 2019 at 3:19 PM",3, 0,
