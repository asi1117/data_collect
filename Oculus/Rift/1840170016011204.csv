2022-05-28 19:17:56.253336,Satconcook,Description does not say ..,"The description should include a line like ""This was my middle school programming project"" or something along those lines as this is bad. It literally looks and feels like someones first attempt at making a VR game. Graphics are basic and the controls are awful. The sound effects just loop over and over and there it nothing scary about it.","Jun 18, 2018 at 9:43 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:17:56.267298,nightcat.mau,Pumpkin Shooter,"The good parts of the game were that it was free on the summer sale and sometimes it works. You run and gun unless you want the ghosts to get you, and that’s the problem. Executing turns or turning around while using your head to aim is sort of hit and miss, even with giant pumpkins as targets.
Gun range is short and it has a nasty habit of not hitting ghosts. I’m guessing the ticking pumpkins are meant to be hit and the laughing ones generate more ghosts, sometimes seven or eight at a time. I’d wanted this game for a while and it’s not terrible, but an option to turn off the timer would be fun.","Jun 18, 2018 at 5:35 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:17:56.301208,FastLawyer,Worst game on Oculus contender,"Yeah, this game is as bad as it looks on the store page. I knew the graphics wouldn't be great. But the movement is terrible because of several pathing issues. The game is just clunky and buggy. There's nothing fun about moving around and trying to shoot these pumpkins. I paid .10 cents, the fact that I'm only down .10 cents and about 10 minutes of my time is the best part. Uninstalled, hide from my library, .. it was so bad I was tempted to burn my computer and HMD just to make sure it is gone for good.","Mar 30, 2018 at 10:06 AM",1, 4,
