2022-05-28 20:08:16.565999,dtdman420,WOW!,"This is really something special. You really need to try this for yourself.

One thing that really bothers me is the anti motion sickness options can not be turned off and needs to be fixed as soon as possible. That is the reason for the 4 stars. Once that is fixed it will be 5

........RESPONSE TO DEV.......
The anti motion sickness options I was referring to are the dark binders around the border of the vision. There is no way to turn that off. Most advanced VR users don't like that because it lowers the field of view even more in a already constricting vr headset.

Also I love the immersian factor of having a huge bulky body but it does get in the way when placing minions and traps It is great while possessing and in battle . Perhaps some floating hands while not possessing.

The fashon show music was so hilarius. I love the humar factor.",Apr 1 at 2:50 AM,4, 37,"Thank you so much for the kind words!

If it was the snap-turning bothering you, there is actually an option to switch to smooth-turning but we haven't surfaced it well yet. 

You have to bring up the options menu with the menu button on the left controller (three horizontal lines) and change it there.

Were there other anti-motion sickness options that bothered you?
We can probably include a disable for those and point players to the smooth-turning option in our next update in early May.

We appreciate the feedback!

Thanks for the additional info about comfort options, we will add an option to disable it!"
2022-05-28 20:08:16.580959,Voffiel,"Sooo good, lost in it for a few hours!","SOOOOOO good, its so much fun watching the replay, we need more spells, weapons, monsters ....I WANT MORE!!! But, yea the replay, if you get any game for anything the replays in this one sold it for me, its so much fun watching an enemy fail at raiding your dungeon. Plus you can get super violent for their dungeons so they can watch you rub it in their faces. Most fun ive had in VR in a bit since alot of other games are just cash grabs or repeats like shooter. Kudos devs, give us updates plz",21 days ago,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:08:16.595920,Amazing74,Action RPG/Realm Building Mix,"This is a first impression, but.... Wow! I love it :-) Nice mix of action rpg, tower defense aspects, with improving the own characters and the own realm and attacking others for loot and currency. Feels fresh in VR. Love the 1st person gameplay with godmode casting. Replay functions is great too, bringing it in position for competative multiplayer. 
I too would suggest an option for removing the motion sickness vignette.",Apr 2 at 3:53 AM,5, 9,"So glad you're liking it!
A vignette disable option is on the way and thanks for taking the time to review and offer feedback!"
2022-05-28 20:08:16.610879,fandomgames,One of the best competitive VR games,"get it, its absolutely amazing. ive been playing and streaming it for the past week since release and the best way i can describe it is a mix between clash of clans and gorn. its a base builder where you set up your base, chose a name for it and set a flag and go raid other peoples bases for resources. you can upgrade your character, weapons, minions base etc to level 5 right now and it takes a ton of work to get there.

theres a god mode that you can heal yourself or cast spells down onto the map and a 3rd person mode (early development) that reminds me of holoception vr. they have clans in the works and a ton of other features planned but even so for the price the game delivers so much right out of the gate.

9/10 overall score: one of the most unique and fun to play vr titles i have tried to date

heres my first stream on it which made it into an article on the game, i have a bunch more as well and im loving every bit of it

2022-05-28 20:08:16.625840,Dopefoo,Exactly what I want in a VR game,"This is exactly what I want in a VR game. The action feels really great! The number of intuitive combat options that just work is really impressive. The base building and attack loop is well done with lots of VR flair. The humor is also actually really funny, which apparently is really hard to do in a game based on the many games I've played that have tried it before, and especially the situational physics based combat and traps. Hopefully some inventive youtubers share some crazy scenarios, the game begs for it. I can see myself coming back to this game over and over again as each game session feels fresh. Good times!",Apr 6 at 8:47 AM,5, 4,Thank you so much for taking the time to review and feedback on what's grabbing you!
2022-05-28 20:08:19.733667,Robloxpro69,very good game but glitches,"i found several glitches in the system. 
-   1  if u walk into a object near the border u press ur self through and walk around the map which is game breaking. 2 u can grab the goblins and just take them under the floor. 3 The witch shooter thingy if he walks on a lauch pad he can either get inside a block and shoot or get under the map or above. Otherwise i rly like this game please fix this if u can.",Apr 13 at 7:21 AM,5, 2,Thank you for letting us know! We have those issues entered in our bug database and we will try to get them addressed in an update soon. Glad to hear you are enjoying the game!
2022-05-28 20:08:19.749624,Gordotronic,"Progress vanished, bugs...","I enjoyed this game at first, althought found it a little repetitive and in a sense aggravating that no one was attacking my fort.  I figured they may have had plans to add more.

Grievance 1: I am a Rift-s/oculus link user.  I reformatted my computer and reinstalled the game, only to find that my progress had been wiped.  Hopefully that can be solved.

Grievance 2: (A) There is a glitch where certain enemies fall off the map and become in a nearly impossible place to find and kill to complete the dungeon.
Grievance 2: (B) This glitch has prevented me from taking down dungeons with the time wasting away with the enemy no where to be found for me to kill, effectively making me lose the dungeon.

Hope this helps.

2022-05-28 20:08:19.782536,Masamune5454,pretty cool. would love to see more,"response to developer, first is there a way to sell items? also the item store is stuck selling 4 hero power disrupters and thats it. im not sure why. you almost give some things to the player too cheap.
alas the comfort, teleports nice but i dont use it much. but turn degree angles, 45 and 90. probably the turning tunnel vision off covers most things.



so baically you connect peices like a table top then posses a champion and fight. i think theres only one champ. which im surprised the imps and zealots ect were able to be controlled as of chamions. there could be alot to it. ya know different abilities ect.
biggest issues would be the lack of comfort options, sometimes theres some slight bad performance it seems but, probably the biggest thing is how to sell stuff?",Apr 16 at 12:58 AM,4, 1,"Thank you for your feedback!  At the moment, there is not a way to sell items.  We have heard from multiple players interested in selling items, though, so we will be giving that serious consideration for a future update.  We will look into the store issue, and feel free to reach out on our Discord server with any issues you’d like to discuss: https://discord.gg/ZyGzJRQURm.  Glad to hear that the tunnel vision disable we added is helpful, and we will keep the other comfort options in mind for the future!

2022-05-28 20:08:19.797496,bbbrrromez,Fun with a sense of humour,"It’s many games wrapped into one- from tabletop, tower defence and first person combat of Gorn. Very entertaining- need to spend more time on it but enjoying it so far!",Apr 3 at 7:02 AM,5, 5,Truly happy you're entertained and we hope you've been able to spend more time with it!
2022-05-28 20:08:22.873445,turbozsemle,Worth the wait!!!,"I bought this gem at launch date, but had issues with the oculus app not starting the install (it was referring to my antivirus blocking the install). I even wrote to the devs and they where super nice to respond and give some hints on how to fix my problem, but sadly none of them worked. I decided to keep the game and not ask for a refund, as i was optimistic, that hopefully oculus will resolve the issue in the near future. A few weeks later and a new update rolled out, immedietly tested if, it fixed my issue, and it did! :)
So was it worth the wait? Hell YEAH! the game is super fun, the art style is unique and funny sometimes, i love the music. The jokes are hulariuos i felt like i was in a Monty Python movie, excellent work! Thank You again!",Apr 22 at 5:36 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:08:22.888405,Phobi82,What an unexpected surprise,"This Game is so funny. It is not only fighting, but also building your realm, leveling up you and your inventory.
I love it, to watch what happened if someone attacked my realm and analyse it. Even the replays are funny to watch. To see this, with all the tiny things... that is somewhat, that you must see. Another great example for the magic, that VR can give.",Apr 19 at 11:13 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:08:22.903365,Doctori,WOW seriously?,"WOW, I played for hour just getting into but I'm so FN impressed !!
