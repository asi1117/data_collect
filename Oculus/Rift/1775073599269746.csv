Went into another  map, stilll broken, couldn't do anything exept from touching and clicking on the  menu. Restarted the game and my computer, still broken. Please fix this, i love this game with all my heart and i hope it gets fixed. I play on an oculus rift and getting an oculus quest for christmas.","Dec 16, 2020 at 6:01 PM",4, 4,"Hi there!

My nieces and nephews think Virtual Reality is the coolest and I am really excited to have them play this title this holiday season.  There is so much interaction here with the dragons.  It has especially great and easy setup, easy to understand controls.  Perfect :)","Dec 22, 2019 at 9:05 AM",5, 7,
