Amazing VR environments, the sense of scale is absolutely insane, the music and sounds are fantastic and its much longer and profound than i was expecting, a tons of mechanics and new things the further you go. Honestly one of the best VR games i've played. Please more from this studio!",Feb 6 at 3:36 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:42:26.783904,mishka11,Jet Pack Adventure Fun!,"Beautiful game. Interesting world building. Basically, its a narrative-based, walking sim combined with puzzles, smash-items, exploration, and jetpack-jump flying. 

Similar to Red Matter but shorter and easier. The only spot that we found to be challenging was the underground cliff jumping. But it was a fun challenge.

Sure, it could be longer and have more challenges. 
And some voice acting wouldve been a plus. 

But we enjoyed this game and felt we got our money's worth (not everyone wants to shoot zombies). Games like this deserve more recognition!

So, if you're looking for an immersive world experience with free roaming exploration...jetpack-style...this is worth a try.","Jun 15, 2020 at 10:20 PM",5, 11,Thank you for your review!
2022-05-28 18:42:26.799862,ParadiseDecay,One of my TOP 3 games on GO!,"My Initial Thoughts:
One of my TOP 3 games on the Oculus GO and a great conversion from 3Dof to 6DoF.
Eclipse Edge Of Light is a Sci-Fi puzzle adventure.
I had some issues with the Rift S, as the developers haven't been able to fully test the game on the device.
But still a great adventure game.
