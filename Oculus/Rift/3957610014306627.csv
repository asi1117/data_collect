2022-05-28 20:09:15.987904,Razorhanny,Pure Innocent Fun,"This game reminds me of my childhood playing F-Zero and Megaman X on the SNES. That pure innocent fun of shooting colorful blasters while listening to futuristic music. No blood, no violence, no stress, only fun! It's awesome on the Quest 2 and even better using Air Link at max graphics, thankfully it's cross buy. The feeling of pulling yourself around the skies while shooting robots is supreme. The music and sound effects are incredible as well. It takes everything good about arcade gaming from the 90's and brings it to VR. Thank you for rekindling that flame on my heart!",Apr 24 at 2:33 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:09:16.002864,loonydevil,One of the most dynamic ones I played,"I've been playing Swarm for a couple of months now and must admit the game is something different from everything else in my library. The mechanics of swinging was something that did take some time to get accustomed too (yep, I fed quite a lot of fish) but after you get used to it, it becames pure fun :). And ofc different weapons, enemies and various challenges some of which might be pretty challenging indeed :)",Aug 14 at 1:05 AM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:09:16.018822,debmasta,A very good one of my library,"I play this game pretty often when I want some change from my routine games. The game mechanics are pretty clean and it is super enjoyable to go super high, slow motion mechanic is also fun, multi kill boosting the speed of my ammos, lot of little details who are bringing a lot more that what you think at first. No motion sickness at all for me and a lot of people. Congrats to the devs",Aug 5 at 8:25 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:09:16.033782,thomedak123,Amazing game,one of the best vr games i have played yet,Aug 20 at 7:57 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:09:16.049739,sevenart,Love it,"I was one of the playtester and boy oh boy, is this one good. Great amount of content. A lot of enemy variety. A lot of guns. Man, you just feel good playing. Swinging up really high and dropping down raining hell on the enemies is just fantastic.","Apr 9, 2021 at 1:09 AM",5, 25,
2022-05-28 20:09:19.196443,MadSpiffy,Game is pausing randomly,"This doesn't seem to be a problem for anybody else but I can't even get through the tutorial because the game keeps pausing itself for no reason 10 seconds or so. I'm not pressing the pause button, my tracking is fine, I'm not too close to my guardian boundry, it just pauses out of nowhere. Any response from the devs would be appreciated.

EDIT: Support from the devs has been extremely lackluster, with entire days going by between emails with 1-2 sentences. Also, the fix the devs suggested didn't work, and they seem to have ghosted me since I haven't heard anything from them in almost 3 days. 

The game is still fun, and the art style is vibrant and just as fun to look at as the game is to play. If you have no technical issues with it I can see it being one of the best wave shooters on oculus, but the lack of support from the devs is quite discouraging. I'll be getting a refund shortly if I continue to hear nothing back.","Jun 11, 2021 at 8:22 PM",2, 0,"Hi Mad Spiffy - sorry that you're having issues!

2022-05-28 20:09:19.211403,SHRIVES93,A Must Own VR Title for Everyone,"Swarm manages to combine the flow of Space Invaders with the style of Jet Set Radio and the traversal of a Spider-Man game in a highly addictive, easy to play but difficult to master experience. My first playthrough had me saying ""oh wow"" over and over again as I was in awe of how well its mechanics, style, and world meshed together for a totally unique experience. Honestly, it feels like the first major showpiece title for VR since BeatSaber. Yes - the gameplay videos make it look incredibly intimidating and you're likely thinking ""I'm going to barf if I play this"" but somehow I've never had that happen in any of my time with the game. The worst thing about it is how quickly time passes when you're playing it because it's so easy to get lost in it as you try mastering its levels, mechanics, and beating its bosses. I can't wait to see what else comes to the game later on, and have loved my time with it so far. Swarm is a MUST OWN.","Apr 9, 2021 at 1:48 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 20:09:19.226363,GameJunky513,solid wave shooter,"Edit: Dev has responded and informed me that graphics options are coming for desktop users. Weird it was an afterthought but glad it's being rectified. Will change to 5 stars when implemented.

Its a pretty good wave shooter. It feels good to grapple around and shoot at a variety of enemies. My biggest gripe and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it literally has zero graphics options. Undoubtedly because of Quest i assume.","Apr 10, 2021 at 11:48 PM",4, 10,"Thanks for the feedback! Graphics options are coming for Desktop systems, specifically:
- option to increase texture resolutions + LODs
- option to enable a high-quality smoothed spectator-cam for recording
If you have other ideas we'd love to hear them on Discord: https://www.swarmvrgame.com/support"
2022-05-28 20:09:19.241323,Thigun,"VR ""Arcade"" Shooter done right!","Just got this game and was a bit afraid it was going to be like other Arcade inspired VR Games that have you moving very little and shooting at incoming hordes with little to no progression, I couldn't be more wrong! This game is absolutely amazing, it grabs you and really throws a spin on the ""Space Invaders"" theme, you must keep on moving, you must keep on shooting and every couple of maps something new is thrown at you, either a new enemy, a gun or a power up, even a map event (Love the Desert Bell)!
Honestly this was not only fun but actually addictive, I saw myself looking at the scoreboards at the end of every level and redoing the level to get better.
If you like shooting, a lot of Tarzan like trick shots and missile dodges, just buy it!
10/10 this is Amazing!","Apr 9, 2021 at 7:52 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:09:19.257280,martinzudaire,Swinging around is so much fun!,"The game gets VR locomotion right! The movement is very fluid and feels very natural. I'm honored to have been a part of its development and playtesting. 
This is the VR game I've always wanted to play!","Apr 9, 2021 at 1:47 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:09:22.348642,Teamrocketracer,Tarzan with a Gun!,"Wow, the dynamics of movement in Swarm, are so natural that it makes this game a blast to play!!!  I felt like I was Tarzan (or if your into spiders, Spiderman) in the Concrete Jungle, taking care of my jungle business as I was swinging and picking off the enemy.

Whenever I faltered, the game got me playing right away again, no waiting around for a big reset.  I like that, since I hate waiting.

I also liked that I had a good sense as to where I was at, even though I moved  around a lot, and even though there is a lot of motion, I didn't get dizzy, which was great.

The game is great, get it!","Apr 9, 2021 at 10:27 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:09:22.363602,mhcisme,Flying high,"This is one of the first games I've played consistently almost every day. I love the comic book styling of the game, and the mechanics feel good and intuitive. The levels are manageable and gradually increase in difficulty as you continue. Enemies and weapons are introduced as you move through the game which keeps you on your toes and makes each new level interesting and fun. I would highly recommend this game.","Apr 23, 2021 at 4:03 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:09:22.378562,hoserx,Hang in there,"Okay, so when I first loaded this game (38 year old male) I was overwhelmed with the swinging and shooting and looking around. Playing on a wired Rift S I thought there'd be no way to handle all of the spinning around.

About 15 minutes into playing, I felt like a web slinging beast, flying around shooting bots left and right. Even better, all of the zipping around caused absolutely no discomfort in my stomach or head. 

The controls are great and the performance is as well, as everything runs smooth (admittedly on an rtx 3090 it should), but there are no issues here. There seems to be a lot of challenge here, so replay value is high. I struggle to complete all of the achievements for each round at the default difficulty but I feel myself getting better every time. 

Give the game a shot if the idea sounds even remotely cool to you. It makes you feel like a superhero.","Apr 12, 2021 at 7:40 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:09:22.404998,Slick1984,Refunding,"I've been in VR since July 1, 2017. I play VR for the experiences that I otherwise would not have and survive, without injury. For VR, those experiences are seeing, hearing and feeling (not touch). If a game lacks any of this, I'm out.

Obviously, I see and hear this game, but I'm not feeling it. I get no feeling of any type of movement. I get no feeling of swinging, flying or falling. So, I'm out.

The good side, there was no motion sickness. But, I think it's because there is no feeling of movement.","Apr 24, 2021 at 5:22 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 20:09:22.419959,john.zigmont,Excellent use of VR,This game rocks and is addicting as the old arcade games I use to play.,"Apr 9, 2021 at 3:29 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:09:25.516785,SteveKnows,SUCH A GOOD GAME MAN!,I had been playing this since Alpha wwooo such a great game on quest feels super good the grappling is some of the best you can play this was MADE for VR! You cant have this experience flat screen. so addictive.,"Apr 9, 2021 at 1:09 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 20:09:25.531746,AyxTV,Honestly my favourite VR experience,"If you're worried about motion sickness, don't be.

I saw the trailer on reddit, the second I saw it I thought ""Conceptually this seems fun but i guarentee it'll make me motion sick.""

I have zero problem with motion sickness in the game, for reference my girlfriend gets car sick very easily, but she was able to play for well over a half an hour without problem.

It's difficult but not too difficult(yet, only on world 2) and honestly replaying levels feels just as great the first time around. 

Final Verdict - 9/10
Honestly one of my favourite VR experiences

Comfort - 8/10
Sometimes when you colide with the walls it gives me a bit of dizzyness, i would've rathered being able to just throw myself into the distance.

Fun - 10/10 
Enough said.

Challenge 7/10
I don't first try every level. Challenging but fair. (I played on normal)

oh, did I mention it's cross buy 😄😄😄😄!!!!","Apr 15, 2021 at 2:54 AM",5, 0,

It's fun to grapple. It's fun to shoot stuff. What can I say, it's a good game","Apr 9, 2021 at 3:15 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:09:25.560668,Joelcapone,"Not your average ""Wave Shooter"" Buy it!","I was hesitant to buy because I already own so many Arcady Shooters and like very few of them. This is a standout game in the genre though, I'm glad I purchased. The movement mechanics add sooo much and they just work so dang well! I love the visual style, super colorful and fun. No motion sickness at all, the movement is smooth and works the way the expect it to. The polish is the icing on the cake, everything just feels/sounds cohesive and works in a really great way. The cutscenes are also enjoyable so far, ""3d comics"" with above average voice acting that made me laugh a couple times.","Apr 11, 2021 at 10:32 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 20:09:28.663540,DredPill,Fun...,Fun falling and dying but to be honest I couldn't get off the intro myself for awhile. Guess I'm trash. The game however is not. It's fantastic. Get it.,"Apr 19, 2021 at 12:38 PM",5, 0,
