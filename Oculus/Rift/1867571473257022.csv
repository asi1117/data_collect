The idea of game is absolutely mesmerizing and immersive but unfortunately it will become boring quick with such music, where is Drum & Bass, Trance, Hardstyle and other great style for playing with? Also multiplayer is basically dead .. oh man such a waste !","Jun 24, 2021 at 12:39 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 15:09:55.286971,kemp.kennedy,It's a 'add your flare' to songs game,"Pick  a song from a varied list of songs. Move different 'sound effect' cubes into 1 of 3 slots, tamper with the effects that cube allows you to do. That is the main jist of this game. And for what it is, it is simply entertaining. 
I had no desire for this game until a friend talked me into getting it on sale. I'm so glad I did. Once you get used to the different cube effects, you can really make some cool music (sort of, off of pre-defined main tracks at least).
The main appeal of this game is for introducing friends to VR, after showing them some 'freebies' where they just sit and watch. It is easy to pick up, has trippy effects, and is interactive AF without a high learning curve.
I expected to toy with this game for a few minutes at a time, and somehow can get sucked in for hours when 'feeling my jam'. All my friends who want to play my VR love this one, and this title is the 1 they ask for most. Due to it's ease of gameplay and quick rewards, all in a well done package.","Jun 5, 2019 at 1:29 PM",5, 15,

2022-05-28 15:09:58.481427,LucasRizzotto,It's a mastapeece,"I had no idea what this game was. I skipped the tutorial to see how easy it would be to figure it out on my own, and I was able to play with pretty much every mechanic after 15 minutes of exploration.

This is the sign of a VR game that's well designed and allows you to discover everything through play. Well done.

Also, the game is f****** awesome","Dec 27, 2018 at 2:05 PM",5, 2,

This game is pretty and the effects awesome .
But no imports of wav or export samples, so you can just play with the preselected music , no multi language .
I put a 3 stars +1 for the title of Olivier - Otomatic.","Nov 9, 2018 at 11:40 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:10:01.631003,Eksile,Best Trade Ever,"Usually every other friday at work I take myself out to lunch, that day I saw this game on sale and decided to skip lunch and buy this game. Best trade off ever! The game is pretty fun but not without its flaws, there are quite a few songs but your selection might be slim depending on your taste. Some song tracks also arent broken up in sample tracks very well, so you can't do a whole lot with a small handful of them.  I would also like to see volume levels on EVERY sample machine in the game as some sounds are too overbearing and overpower the loops/tracks. Being able to premake tracks would be very cool as well. You can see they were kind of headed that way in one of the features, however it is too shallow of a function to be used functionally. Last but not least.... mod support, mod SUPPORT, MOD SUPPORT. TLDR: This game is pretty fun if you just like to jack around with music and experiment with how a song might sound. Keep up the good work guys!","Oct 18, 2018 at 3:55 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:10:01.646961,Suprix,Oh my god.,"This game is actually incredible. It makes you feel so amazing when you're just jamming out and remixing. The game queues up your beats in a way that almost always sounds good so don't be afraid of not having rhythm, they do that part for you ;]","Oct 30, 2018 at 12:45 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:10:01.660923,uchango,Incredible!,"I think the creators succeeded very well at balancing Electronauts wide target audience, while still keeping it sophisticated enough for the experimentation to be as fun as it is. If they end up porting this to the upcoming Oculus Quest, I believe it'll be one of its highlights.

The creators have already anounced they're planning on widening the song selection, the only part I think they still need to work on for this to become a must have VR app.","Oct 10, 2018 at 3:01 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:10:01.675883,theregoes2,"Flipping Amazing, and a decent workout","This game makes you feel like you are an awesome musician and it does it so well that at first I wasn't sure if it was the game helping me or if I had stumbled on to something that I just had a natural talent for. It's definitely the game. But it never feels like it. You can jump right in and have fun and you can go deeper if you want to. Really good time so far. And as I said, it can be a good workout if you really get into the music and play as hard as you can.","Oct 6, 2018 at 4:32 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:10:01.690843,Link83337,Incredible,This game is amazing and fun. Its absolutely worth playing with a friend. My only issue is that after a while i find myself bored of making music seeing as how this doesn't have much to offer in its instruments and beats but its still an amazing game and probably the most user friendly ive ever seen in my life!,"Sep 5, 2018 at 10:03 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:10:04.800526,ooolookafishy,A dream come true.,"I'm a sucker for some good electronic music. This was a dream come true. It's a lot of fun, but they will need to continue to add songs to keep it lively (which I read they will). Hopefully this turns in to something like beatsaber, where people can add songs themselves. But if you want to feel like a DJ this is your jam. I was happy to pay the 18 bucks for it. 

Pros: 
You edit real songs. They're pretty well known songs and have a wide range of music. I was super pumped to see Odesza.
It's an unexplainable real feel thing - you feel like a dj. I'm not going to lie I was jamming out dancing in my living room while freestyling some music. Hands in the air thinking I was Armin Van Buren or something. 
You can save the edited songs you create. Songs are broken in to short clips i.e. intro, drop, beat, etc. You mix and match, you edit how it sounds in real time. Your arrangement of clips dont move, but the little sounds and things you add is a form of freestyling a song I guess. Finding out what sounds work is so much fun. 

Cons
You can only save your arrangement of clips. For example, if I want to put together 3 intros and have the drop right after, I can re-load that up. However, any real time edits (like changing the loop sounds, or throwing the little grenades that make different noises) can't be saved. You save your arrangement and then pretty music freestyle a new song every time - you don't save your full recreation of the original song.
There is a short lag (like tenth of a second kind of short) between hitting the sound spheres and the sound coming out. It's enough to be annoying when you want to hear something the second you hit the sphere. But the game just came out today so I can't complain.

 I wish I could add an extra beat or a few piano key notes. I have a feeling this will come with the evolution of the game.

Overall well worth the money. If you love music and enjoy being creative this is for you.","Aug 8, 2018 at 5:50 AM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 15:10:04.845406,R2-3PO,Fun times!,"This is a fun game, I am glad I purchased it.  It is very easy to get lost in it for a long time.  The songs are cool and the entire experience is enjoyable as you experiment with the different instruments and features.  Sort of mindless entertainment if I'm being honest.  I can understand why someone who does this for a living might not be as entertained.  You're not actually learning music.  But all the things you ARE doing make you feel like a rockstar nonetheless. I recommend it.","Aug 12, 2018 at 2:44 PM",5, 3,

(Oculus does not have links activated so to find this video search YouTube for 'Paradise Decay VR Electronauts' 

My Thoughts:
Having been a DJ in the late 90's for over 10 years, one could only dream of the Virtual Technology on offer here.
Survios the creators of the amazing Sprint Vector and Raw Data experiences have out done themselves in the VR creativity department. This app allows to to remix tracks on the fly and also arrange and save your own creations.
This experience is easy to pick up and play you'll be remixing tracks within minutes.
The only thing missing for me is the ability to add different music sounds and samples to the cubes, that you use to create your tracks.
If you have ever had any interest in making or creating music then this is a must!","Aug 8, 2018 at 2:23 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:10:08.024902,Maliceous_D,Electronauts,"Gets 5 stars for pure fun factor. Visuals are great, choice of music suits the game and has a learning curve that  anyone can pick up. Like everyone else thought I would play for a couple of minutes and found 2 hours had gone past. Even if I don't play again (which I will) it was definitely worth the money.","Aug 15, 2018 at 4:09 AM",5, 5,

Am no dj but i do love how smoothly it feels and that sense of awe you get as you experment with diffrent beats and drumming away at orbs.

Man this game is SUPER cool!!   There are some awesome tunes and just mixing them up is awesome.  I was just going to play for a few minutes and boom about 2 hrs had gone by.
