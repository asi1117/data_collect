2022-05-28 20:05:56.229097,ChemaGo,Totally recommendable!,"The setting is amazing and helps you fully immerse yourself in the story. The graphics are 10 and the skies totally breathtaking. The music accompanies perfectly and takes you to moments of tension during the game. As a good Lovecraft video game, it is full of references and surprises.

I have tried both the Virtual Reality version and the PC version and both are very good, getting the VR version to really transport you to the world of the game.

In short, a totally recommendable experience that leaves you wanting more.",Sep 10 at 12:32 AM,5, 3,
