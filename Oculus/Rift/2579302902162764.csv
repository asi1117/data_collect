While the train glides past you, strange creatures with octopi-like hair poke their heads out. And their movement as well as hair movement can vary in rather unexpected ways... which makes the task of cutting hair more challenging and fun. Initially, I thought the scissors would be awkward to hold via controllers... but actually, they felt quite natural in hand. 

The creatures react to the cuts with exclamations - all in English - and it might've been interesting if some of them had their own alien language and weird squeals, squawks, sniffles etc. That said, their reactions to cuts and pokes were amusing and aided immersion.

In addition, the animations were well done. Bravo!!","Mar 28, 2020 at 7:18 AM",5, 3,
