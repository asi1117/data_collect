2022-05-28 18:54:47.152682,VibrationsOfDoom,NEEDS A QUEST 2 PORT BADLY!!!,"Played this again on the Quest 2 with a link cable... Devs, PLEASE port this over to the Quest 2!!! We should be able to store this game on the headset!! Rift is being phased out and I shudder to think this game may no longer be playable if they decide to drop support for all the Rift games!!

Cool graphics, great music, a leaderboard that saves high scores around the world, and endless challenges... Unlock vehicles, modes, and if you think ""fly through the air and shoot anything that moves"" gets boring, well... Obviously you haven't played through all the different modes... There's supposed to be a storyline with a big boss challenge but unfortunately I haven't see this...

GET THIS A-GOING ON THE QUEST 2 so I can store it on my headset!!! I shouldn't have to lug around a PC or laptop to get these amazing Rift games onto the Quest 2 headset! (I'm looking at u Xion, Selfie Tennis, BeatCrash and all the others...)",Nov 28 at 3:36 PM,4, 2,Thanks for support. Quest will be definitelly supported for all my games next year.
2022-05-28 18:54:47.167642,KamenPirate,Well worth the money,"Great little game with a lot of replay value.

Large quantity of ships with different stats and abilities and a good variety of game modes. Wether it is to get all the stars or to achieve the high score in each modes, it should keep you entertained for a while.

Very catchy soundtrack if a bit repetitive

Difficult but not unfair for the most part. I'm docking a star for level 60, though. The only level that made me angry.

Didn't get any motion sickness in my initial straight 2 hours playsassion.

Definitely recommend you pick it up.","Sep 13, 2020 at 2:29 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:47.182602,Lalle75,Very funny and challenging,"Very basic graphics - like an older version of Tron - sometimes fast, sometimes slow. It's basically flying through tunnels and trenches made of blocks.
But it's lots of fun.","Sep 19, 2020 at 5:06 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:54:47.196565,m4xcp,Great value for money and a lot of fun,"A perfect arcade game. I love it. It can be both: fast paced or slow in a balloon. It would not be the first vr game which I would show to my grantma, but certainly to my girlfriend and she loves it too. Compete for high scores and if you ever get tired of the airplane you have got, then you want to unlock further planes by playing the arcade missions. The graphic looks crisp sharp even on the oculus cv1 and controls can be configured, but the defaults work well for me.","Jun 21, 2020 at 12:23 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:54:47.212522,xor1337,Battle of endor death star tunnel run!,"Great game, I have a few issues.
1. when playing with touch and using thumbstick, sometimes the trigger button to fire won't work.  (tilt and head aiming don't have this problem)

2. Drawing distance could be longer I think, would make it more immursive instead of always staring at a ""fog"". At least in the left right motion speeder mode.

3. It would be nice for each mode to have a different song, or at least more than the single song that plays constantly.

4. It would be really great to have the ability to roll the ship 90 deg ""vertical"" so that you can skim sideways between two close vertical towers, akin to playing Star Fox, or how you always see ships doing in Star Wars.

5. Maybe a few more varing types of obsticals, like apeture closing doors, or spiraling tunnles that you have to skim through.

Other than those things mentioned, this game is easily worth $5, maybe more like  $10.  

I had a great time with this game, thank you Developer.","Jun 24, 2020 at 8:10 AM",5, 1,Thanks for review and detailed tips. It is great inspiration for an update.
2022-05-28 18:54:50.345144,TheDaddyToe,Great!,Still in early development. You get a lot for 4 bucks.  Lots of fun.,"Feb 20, 2020 at 8:55 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:50.361101,Skyflipper,,"Tryingto play with the Rift & Touch. However, the manual display on the left only shows the buttons of the gamepad and if I press a Touch button it flickers and shows the button layout of the Touch for a fractio of a second. Also all other menu items seem to only react for the blink of an eye on my Touch. Needless to say that controlling a vehicle with this misbehavior is impossible. Sad, because the  design of the game looks very promising :-(
Update:
Developer feedback was quick & problem is solved now. Apparently it was an Oculus driver issue - being fixed with a driver update.
Cool and fast-paced arcade game. Feels much like being *inside* the game. Pretty much TRON-like but more colorful :-)","Dec 29, 2019 at 6:13 AM",5, 0,"It looks like some trouble with your gamepad. Gamepad is enabled, when you push something or use any axis. You can have bad calibration of the gamepad so it turn it on automatically. Can you turn off your gamepad to test? Let me know, if it helps. cenda@cenda.cz"
2022-05-28 18:54:50.375064,Vulpelux,Fun and Challenging,"The title says it all, this game is hella fun and a great time waster if you're looking for one. Like playing Mario Kart or Animal Crossing. It isn't really a hardcore game but it's got enough content to play for ages if you're into it. One thing I don't like is that the collisions are VERY sensitive, so even if you think you avoided an obstacle if even one pixel hits it's game over, start again. This is annoying yes, but the levels are short and it doesn't hold hands which is great, but it's also not super difficult like Dark Souls or Cuphead which makes it great for casual players too.","Oct 26, 2019 at 10:47 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:54:50.390024,ShineHunter,"Fun, crazy fast and cheap game.","Watch my video here https://youtu.be/wPm9u2NkrtA
Colourful and sharp. Fast-paced game of dodging and shooting. Many ships and many levels. Really fun and addictive. Audio is perfect for this retro style game.","Jan 19, 2020 at 10:24 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:54:50.404984,MsOpportunity,,"Just bought this with the oculus interstellar package and my intial impressions are favourable. A nice simple game where you try to get as far as you can.  Plenty to unlock.

The developer is listening to feedback from the reviews and recently added an option to invert the flight controls for up and down to simulate flight. So I am upping my score.

The big issue I find that as I prefer to use the XBox Controller to play the game is that sometimes the game does not seem to see the controller properly at start, so the axes don't register. Not sure wether this is because the touch controllers are in sleep mode. But repeated restarts don't seem to cure the issue.","Aug 23, 2019 at 3:15 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:53.493722,17953648,It's fun,"I played this game on the Google Cardboard a while ago. In my opinion, it is the best Cardboard game. Now it's on the Rift and so much content was added since then. And furthermore, it seems like the developer is taking feedback and suggestions, and improving and updating the game accordingly. I really enjoy playing this game and can't wait to play the story when it's finished.","Aug 14, 2019 at 5:37 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:54:53.509680,acemcgee,good concept but has 2 fatal flaws,"environment is nice and immersive. plenty  of diferent ships to fly and inetresting game modes but it has 2 fatal flaws. There are no instructions as to what anything on your controller does so its trial by fire as to how to fly and how to control your ship, The major fatal flaw tho is the collision detection. If you get anywhere near an obstacle you wil instantly die and have to restart the level. most of the time the obstacle hits from the side ( which you cannot see) I wanted to like this game but couldnt play it longer then 15 minutes due to collision issues. How can i possibly progress if i die to things that dont even hit me???","Aug 10, 2019 at 5:05 AM",2, 0,"Instructions are on the left side in the main menu, but maybe not very visible. Check current version it is much more notable now. I can check your collision issues. Let me know what ship you use or more details on: cenda@cenda.cz. If you can provide video from gameplay, it helps a lot. But note that your planes has wings, so they are wider than you think. Every plane has unique shape. Look around and check it. Thank you for feedback."
2022-05-28 18:54:53.524640,Bitconneect,Boooring,"So slow paced, good thing I paid for it with the Oculus credit, I lasted 10 minutes.","Aug 30, 2019 at 5:57 AM",1, 0,"Have you tried also another modes? Explorer mode is slow and peaceful, but Madness or Attacker is very fast and full of action. Horizon is easier to control, but super fast."
2022-05-28 18:54:53.540597,Semtex-Yoyo,Fast Addictive Fun,"Wow very imperssed with this game, gave it a quick try and ended up on it for 3 hours. It reminds me of one of the sub games in technolust. Graphix are simple yes impressive. So many game modes and more to come. I cant belive the price only $3, easilly worth $10 or even $15.","Apr 26, 2019 at 4:30 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:54:53.554560,RuneSR2,Fun and immersive game - for the price,"Performance is great - even forcing super sampling 2.0 and 4xAA I got solid 90+ fps using a GTX 1080. Touch controls work nicely and I found HMD-directed movement to work best. There're many game modes, so gameplay doesn't feel repetitive. I don't think this is a game you play for many hours, but more a game to fill a few minutes, maybe half an hour. A tutorial of the different control methods (tilt, HMD, etc.) could be nice for new players. For the price you'll have a hard time finding anything better for the Rift.","Apr 20, 2019 at 7:10 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:54:56.639309,tmxmra,This is a good game,"The game is fun and addictive.

Incase anyone else gets this, the game loaded after initial installation, but since then it fails to start with oculus error OVR25027186.

I found that my Anti-Malware had quarantined the executable for the game 
 in the belief that it was harmful.  I restored the file and the game now loads.


EDIT: Updates are welcome, but the hi scores should be reset when the gameplay for the level has been modified","Mar 24, 2019 at 12:28 AM",5, 2,You are right. I have to finish some other things and highscore will be cleared ;)
2022-05-28 18:54:56.654269,VJFranzK,It's a fun casual flight game!,"I began to think of StarFox, and other such titles.  I thought it might be better to see more variety of enemy ships, etc.
It's alternately relaxing and hyper, depending on the level type.","Mar 29, 2019 at 10:04 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:54:56.685187,Eniggly,"300+ VR Games, compelled to do review","150+ Oculus library and 180+ Steam VR games . . . . . and I love this!
Yes it is a simple concept, but it is very well implemented.
I played through a heep of missions to start with and the hours just flew by, on a number of sessions. Then my competitive side kicked in, and did it ! Endless Arcade and a top score  = ;oP

I have played most days, sometimes for a short spell and other times for hour+ long sessions. 

I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME, IT IS WHAT IT IS, AS WHAT IT'S MEANT TO BE !

I've always had a thing for Voxel type games but this stands up in it's own right as it's fast and fun and cheap as chips . . . . what more do you want ?
You only have to watch the demo to know if it's your bag, and when it is you won't be disappointed !

P.S. I'm using the Rift !","Feb 24, 2019 at 8:09 AM",5, 2,"Wow! You are big gamer :) Thank you for review, it is great motivation for the updates. Now I am finishing better feel in the cockpit ( you will see it soon ;) ) and then I want to add story with campaign."
2022-05-28 18:54:56.700146,taquitobuddy,Can't recommend this for Rift at all,"While this might be a decent title for smartphones or maybe Go for a few dollars, I can't recommend this for a Rift user at all.  It is just too basic without hardly any content.  It has lots of missions/modes, but all through the same map.  It isn't terrible, just not a good fit for Rift at all because there are so many other, better Rift games.","Feb 21, 2019 at 5:57 PM",1, 2,"You mentioned that it is not terrible, but 1 star review mean very bad game. Of course it is not AAA title with many hours of gameplay, on the other side it is not game for $20+. It looks exactly same like on the screenshots or video. About ""without content"". It has 27 missions, 7 different game modes and 29 machines and still growing. Btw. it fully support Touch controllers and gamepad, so it is not simple port from mobile. More missions and environments you will get with updates."
