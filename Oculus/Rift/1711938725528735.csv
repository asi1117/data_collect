2022-05-28 14:46:32.390048,FutureShock_,Excellent game neglected by devs,"So this should be one of the most solidly five-star games in my library. It's a worthy successor to LE1 and builds on the former game's strong foundation to push the story and gameplay forward.

The experience itself, including the thick atmosphere, the voice acting, character design, and art direction are simply phenomenal. It's easily in the same category as something like Alyx despite having a tiny fraction of the playerbase.

The mechanics from the first game are expanded upon here not so much to add more depth but to give you more to do. This can sometimes feel like padding but the greater reliance on voice acting, set pieces, and visual diversity does a great job at glossing over the issue of repetitiveness.

Graphically and in terms of physics, this game has a lot more going on than its predecessor which leads me into why I removed a star and why I waited this long to review a game I was so hyped for prior to release:

This was the last PCVR title funded by Oculus Studios before their shift to mobile. Upon release, the game wasn't advertised much and there was almost zero support in the form of patches or updates. It made me a bit sad to see how many man-hours and love went into this only for it to be dropped like a cold potato onto the deprecated Oculus Store for PC. 

If there weren't any major bugs this wouldn't be a problem but the game has issues with memory / VRAM usage as it relates to texture streaming. This means that even on beastly rigs like mine, you have to play around with the settings a lot to hit playable framerates. 


In my case, using Virtual Desktop at Medium with the game settings at Medium did the trick. Air Link used too much VRAM on top of what the game was using. Link is probably fine but who wants to play a game in zero gravity with a tether? 

Now that I've got the game running well, the issues with texture streaming can still be distracting. High quality textures tend to load in way too late. 

Hopefully Ready at Dawn has some plans to update and fix this title. It really deserves better. It's an Alyx competitor hidden on the Oculus PC platform behind some bugs that should've been fixed in a day one patch.",Apr 14 at 9:41 PM,4, 61,
2022-05-28 14:46:32.405009,oscar_pojkarna,"Peformance is terrible, story is amazing","After about 2h the game started to have constant stuttering - even though neither graphics card, memory or CPU are fully utilized (rtx3070, ryzen 3600, 32gb ram, SSD, Rift S).

Several other seems to have this problem - this helped for me:
* Go to in-game settings and change the screen to ""windowed"", and minimize the screen mirroring on your computer screen.

This solved it completely for me, must be some bug. Please look in to this devs.
Still, the performance is far from optimal, textures are constantly popping in.

Wold be 5 star if the game would run better.",Apr 19 at 2:35 AM,3, 20,
2022-05-28 14:46:32.420966,Dantheman825,Do not buy this in its current state,"I'll say off the bat that this a good game, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well. But it's plagued with bugs and awful performance on hardware that should on paper fit the bill. 

I have a Ryzen 5 1600 and a GTX 1660 Super, it's below recommended specs, but should at least be playable at low settings. I had to turn everything down to the absolute minimum with resolution scale down to 50%, and even then, performance wasn't always perfect. Add that to some annoying texture pop-in that comes well after you've gotten close to said object, and it holds me back from really enjoying this game to its fullest.

from talking to others, I can gather that mileage varies tremendously per system, people with 3090s were only able to run this at Medium settings, while another with a 1060 could comfortably play at low, with a higher resolution scale than me. At best, this game is playable though unideal, at worst, it's pretty much unplayable. Devs say that overclocking causes issues, so turn that off if you can, but even without that, I think the issue goes deeper than that.

I want to love this game, but the bugs and performance make it hard for me. And after nearly half a year, this game only got one bug fix update, while EchoVR has gotten like 3 seasons worth of content, so it's pretty clear what the dev's current priorities are.",Apr 25 at 5:56 AM,2, 9,

Oculus released this with little to none spreadout of advertising making it a low playerbase game. The new controls and game mechanics are good, but you have to tweak the settings for it to be playable. There are bugs that should've been fixed like in a day one patch. No patches as its the last pcvr game, as Oculus switched to mobile on quest 2. Im dissapointed and this could've been a better game.",2 days ago,3, 0,
2022-05-28 14:46:32.451883,scoobynut,Immersive and moving,"I played Lone Echo and couldn’t wait for the sequel. I wasn’t disappointed.  The production values and quality of the game is fantastic- graphics, physics and story are a cut above. It’s more of of mini movie that you are a character in.

I didn’t notice any bugs that the reviewer mentioned, but I didn’t realise my graphics settings were on auto low until I finished. Even so I thought the graphics were superb.  Start up level loading could take maybe 30 seconds (it’s on an SSD) but there are rarely pauses to load when exploring unless you go a long way.

There is a main story where you need to save mankind, but there are also side missions which can be dipped in and out of in pretty much any order. You can also choose not to finish them all - however if you enjoy exploring I would recommend to do them (to get maximum value).  You will get to a point in the storyline where you cannot go into the side missions, and you are told that a few times by the characters.

The story unfolds and feels epic in scale in terms of surroundings (you are in space after all!).

There was only one place where I got stuck and could figure out how to get past the ticks - so I moved on as it wasn’t critical.

The plot is very clever, and at times Lone Echo is quite powerful emotionally. No spoilers.

I would recommend to anyone as Lone Echo and Lone Echo 2 are fine examples of how to make the most from VR.

Kudos to the developer team 👍",Mar 16 at 11:18 PM,5, 16,

What a cheek, especially given the price tag. I am sure that the content itself (story, voice acting etc.) is as beautiful as in part 1.

After the first part, the beautiful story continues and it felt like coming home. Part 2 is at least as good as part 1 and at the end I really stood with tears in my eyes.

However it does suffer from optimization issues.  No matter what setting you choose you'll have studders and occasionally be interupted by loading screens.

It's mostly a continuation of the previous game. There are some new mechanics added, which is nice. But it doesn't feel particularly fresh overall. Same slow pacing, driven by exploration, story, and simple challenges in a zero-G environment. Slightly improved graphics, I think.

The interactions with the arm controls could also use some improvement.

This sequal offers a slight graphical upgrade, perhaps because the original is still so accomplished in this area & has aged very well, in my opinion.
In gameplay, it offers an expanded range of tools & enemies which introduce new gameplay permutations. 
In story, it has an expanded cast of characters & voice acting that gives us a bigger picture of the events around the 1st game.

Lone Echo 2 is by far the best VR game I have ever played. Hell, it might even be the best game I have ever played in general! The story was captivating, it had me on edge and wanting more and more at so many parts. And the ending, dear god the ending! This here, this extraordinary title. This is the only game that I have ever played that made me cry. I applaud you Ready at Dawn, I really do. <3

Peformance: Overall peformance was great. No stuttering or anything of the sort. I only crashed once, which was probably due to the fact that I have modified graphical settings on my headset. 11/10!!!

And sadly there is no synchronization in other languages (that was to be expected very differently after the LoneEcho2 trailer experience !!!)

I sincerely hope for a subsequent (atlas) patch with a German voiceover ... as it happened in part 1. (This was almost perfect) Otherwise a large part of the story is lost if you don't speak English as your mother tongue.

2022-05-28 14:46:57.786052,Dremy,One of the best VR titles out there,"Lone echo has always been known as one of the most stunningly beautiful games you can experience in VR and it's sequel is no different. Lone Echo II has carried over everything that made the first game so great, while moving away a bit from the things that didn't work quite as well, all while adding in some brand new game play elements and even a little combat. This game is faster paced and more exciting than the first game, with a story that evolves much faster. Overall I think this game is better than the first and is easily in my top 3 VR single player games of all time (with Half Life Alyx and Resident Evil 4). I highly recommend both Lone Echo I and II. Definitely don't play this if you haven't played the first game, as this is a very story driven game and the sequel picks up right where the first game left off, which was a cliffhanger. So if you don't play the first game, you aren't going to understand what is going on.

I didn't have any trouble with stuttering or crashes while playing at high settings, but I was running it on a Quest 2 via airlink on a system with a Ryzen 9 5900X and RTX 3080. I did get weirdly long loading screens whenever loading a saved game, but that was it. They've since issued an update to the game that fixed quite a few bugs, so hopefully that will help with some of the issues people have been having. This is a game that likes having a good cpu though, much like the first game.",Dec 10 at 12:58 AM,5, 6,

And yes you can tell Lone Echo 2 had a lot of money and time put behind it…but I think it could have used a little more time as the game crashes and performance issues tell the story of a game that might have benefitted from a little more optimization. Regardless though Lone Echo 2 is more of what you loved from the first title and in fact narratively picks up right where the first title ended. In fact with how similar this game looks and feels to the first it to me almost feels like Lone Echo 1.5, rather than a full blown sequel. Though that’s not necessarily a bad thing if you loved the first.",Oct 13 at 1:01 AM,4, 120,

I have to admit, I was wrong. So very wrong. LE2 runs appallingly on my system (i7 10750, RTX 2060, 16gb ram), unlike the first which ran fantastically and looked beautiful. LE2 has to be low everything and even then it crashes with regularity.
I really wanted to love this game, but with everything set to low it looks like something the dog has dragged in.
If there is an optimisation patch that impetus this, I will review my score here but until then it has to be a low score from me. So disappointed :(",Jan 13 at 7:08 PM,2, 3,
2022-05-28 14:47:00.901320,canyonero80,Game is not worth buying,"ok lets start with my PC specs as they will be relevant later in the review.
CPU - Core i7 9700K
Ram - 32GB DDR4 3200
Video - RTX 3070
Game running from an NVME disk
OS - Windows 11 and 10

Good parts about the game.
 if you love the original then you will love this as it's more of the same. Graphically the game is great albeit texures pop in and out all the time. 

Bad parts about the game.
the game repeatedly goes from 120 FPS to 2 SPF and makes you want to be sick. changing graphical setting does not fix this issue, however minimising the 2D video on the desktop does fix the issue somewhat. so i can live with this workaround if it wasn't for the bigger issue.
in the part of the game when you get given a new shell and get told to shutdown to get your conciousness transferred. you shutdown and the screen goes blank, then never comes back again. I can still hear sounds, i can feel vibrations, and apparently i can die too. but i never see anything ever again. I have tried reloading from previous saves, and ever restarting the game again. But nothing works, so this makes the game useless. as you cannot pass this point.

The game has been out for a number of weeks now and there are so many problems with it. (Almost all graphical) reported by what seems thousands of people, and the devs have never responded or released an update to the game. 


UPDATE:
I have looked through the developers discord chanel and whenever someone has a complaint about the game and they say they run windows 11 the devs always say the problem is windows 11. Which sounds so much like a cop out to me, as no other game has an issue. So i completely formatted, and reinstalled windows 10 from scratch and guess what. Exactly the same problems are there, no difference at all. 
Tried running this game from 2nd completely different PC, and this time the screen goes blank right at the beginning of the game.

Upon starting the game and seeing Olivia's blurred, pixelated face 5 feet away from me, there was immediately something wrong. Even on a decent pc like mine (I can run games like the first Lone Echo and Half Life Alyx with better graphics settings than this), all of the graphics settings default to Low, and the game freaks out if you turn them up. Loading screens take forever, and the graphics obviously look terrible with the required settings.

I will update if they fix the crashes. I got an 8700k@4.9 stable for everything else, 3080, 16gb, the game runs great besides some very poor texture load/streaming. But the crashes every 5-15 mins is brutal. I got almost all the big VR games, so many it is embarassing. They don't crash like this. On their discord they recommend turning off all overclocks including xmp ram profiles. I am not doing that everytime I want to play.

2022-05-28 14:47:04.070975,Ultimeas,Exactly What I Wanted,"When Lone Echo 2 first released, I believe I left a 1 star review (that I can not find now) and refunded, due to crashing less than 10 seconds into gameplay no matter what I did.  Well I repurchased it last weekend, and I'm not sure what was changed/patched, but I was finally able to fully play through and complete the game.   I am SO GLAD that I was finally able to play it.

I had been looking forward to the game for a long time, I played the original as one of my first games back when the Rift S first came out, and was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY by it.  To me, even to this day (and this includes Alyx), nothing comes close to Lone Echos immersion.  The movement system feels so natural and technical, while selecting your gadget on your arm, checking objectives and selecting text all feels so in place I forget that I'm playing a game.  

I still find the story amazing, and although the second Lone Echo does not have as much mystery as the first, its scope and ambition are wildly beyond the first.  There was indeed some performance hiccups along the way, but they didn't really detract from my enjoyment since I was able to enjoy the game :).",Dec 2 at 10:13 AM,5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:47:04.102884,specek,Beautiful Nightmare,"Well, what to say.... Such a beautiful story destroyed by bad graphics with lot of bugs. Where to start? My rig is I9-10850K, 64GB RAM, fast nvme for os, another nvme for data, RTX 3070, Quest 2 with link cable (or airlink, doesn't matter). You put all settings to high - game is not playable, glitch after glitch, crash randomly several times. Memory usage on 3070 is almost full (7.9 from 8GB) and this is first problem- you would need 24GB on card maybe to get textures loaded in full i presume. GPU utilization over 90%. 
On opposite side you switch all to low- game crashes less BUT graphics is just very bad. It's much worst than Echo 1, textures not loading,  you are  not able to read text etc. Don't know what had been done to original game engine but something went wrong, why reinvent wheel? When all settings are on LOW - GPU utilization is around 70% and 7.1GB memory usage on card. Funny enough CPU utilization in both settings is less than 20%... I bought this game for story and hoped for better graphics (long develop time). Story line feels strong for now but technically this game is broken. Devs knows that... looks like they had either tight timelines from oculus, something is broken inside their team or they focused or other more important(money, money)  projects.

The game runs TERRIBLY even on high end computers (I have an RTX 3080, a very fast NVME SSD and processor, lots of RAM). This includes :
- very slow launch loading times when the app launches
- grey load screens now and then, when floating in space (at first I thought it was a display bug, because grey screen, but when I turned around there was a sign saying ""loading"", so even that they couldn't do well :/ )
- HUGE texture/model popping (basically, each time you turn your head 180° outside, asteroids will look like grey boxes for at least 5-10 seconds)
- some stutters

And all this is on a very high end computer.

Now, related to the game itself, it has some repetitive actions (deploying charing stations, and reactivating transports), but that unlock improvements, so it's a tradeoff... I would have preferred if the improvements were unlocked by secondary quests, and not repetitive action but hey...

What I found VERY FRUSTRATING, was the ""syncing the radio stations"" task. It involves activating a station, flying very fast (you only have 25 seconds, which is VERY short) to the next one, and repeat that maybe 6 times in a row... if you fail just one (and the timing leaves absolutely no room for error), you have to re-do it all... I completed 2 so far, and hated all of it.

Otherwise, it's the sequel of Lone Echo 1, there's everything that made it good... so... yaay...",Nov 20 at 6:22 PM,1, 10,

Lone Echo 2 picks up right where the original left off - both in terms of the story and gameplay. However, it's a much bigger game with more areas to explore, more sights to behold, more twists to the story and more optional objectives to complete. Much as an original game, it's a spectacular self-paced story-driven adventure/exploration in an open space. 

However, being a much bigger game as a whole, Lone Echo 2 offers only a few new gameplay mechanics. As a result it feels like you have more to explore, but less to do, compared with the original. Sometimes to the point of utter repetitiveness. 

The other downside is a bunch of performance and visual issues even on a powerful hardware. Hopefully, these will get solved after a few updates.

So it's not revolutionary and not ideal. At the same time I have spent almost 20 hours in this game and thoroughly enjoyed it. With that said, my score is 5/5.

I think Lone Echo 1 is one, if not the best, VR game I played since 2018 and I played it several times, always with goosebumps. I loved it's immersion and how it just pulled you into the experience deeper and deeper and technically it was the absolute top-notch.

I was really hyped when they announced Lone Echo 2, as many others were. But after playing now for ~2 hours I have some mixed feelings. Actually I am thinking about waiting some weeks before I continue because there are some massive bugs that really kill the immersion for me.

Story was fine until here but HECK.... WHY?

My rig:
RTX3090FE
R9 5900X

The main bug:
Textures take ages to load. You grab something and you just can't read what it says and have to wait like 10 seconds until it goes from 32x32 pixels to 4K or so. I mean... I've got the hardware. There are 24gigs of VRAM. Just put it in there! WTF. This happened to me in almost every scene. Posters you can't read. Details you can't see. When I boarded from the station to the other ship there were massive textures of VERY BIG objects just not loading up (not like unimportant things). It was looking like a game from 2000. That's when I decided to just exit and write the review. FIX THIS NOW!

A bit disappointing:
- english only, the german voice acting was epic, really gave more immersion
- game crashed several times when I cranked up settings in the graphics menu (worked in the end but the game crashed 3 times before story)
- When I first started the game it all looked like super sampled down / unsharp hands, wanted to crank settings up but it wouldn't let me at first. I mean wtf. I hate games that just start with the story and won't let you select settings first. WHY.

I also checked regular oculus software and beta version, I set my cpu/gpu to default settings because OCed hardware according to the devs is ""bad"", btw - why is that if it's rock solid with literally everything else but not LE2?). Checked with different link/airlink settings - low/high constant/dynamic bitrate. Lowest possible graphics settings, etc. 
Nothing helps - I got hard crash (with black screen) or BSOD: WHEA errors and I want to underline this - WITHOUT any cpu/gpu overclocking as recommended!
I've seen better working games which were in early access. I highly do not recommend this game. Their Discord server is starting to have more and more complaints but there is no solution except ""do not overclock"" which doesn't solve the crash issue at all.",Oct 20 at 6:10 AM,1, 12,

2022-05-28 14:47:32.508864,VRPhantom,A Fantastic Sci-FI Adventure,"The original Lone Echo was one of my first VR experiences and remains one of my favorites. Lone Echo 2 however somehow manages to improve upon it. Picking up shortly after the events of the first game, you once again inhabit the body of Jack, a very sophisticated robot who has developed a close relationship with his friend, captain Olivia Rhodes. Together, you embark on a grand adventure.

Graphically, the game is a technical showcase that creates a breathtaking world for you to explore. Taking place in and around the rings of Saturn, just flying around the various habitats and structures is a lot of fun.

The game is also an outstanding tactile experience that allows you to interact with your environments in lots of new and interesting ways.

Where the game really excels for me though is in the realization of the characters you interact with. The conversations and exchanges you engage in feel really authentic and the ending packs quite the emotional wallop.

Technically the game does have some hiccups. Random textures can take an inordinate time to load and the framerate can be inconsistent at times when a lot is happening on screen. None of it breaks the game but it could definitely use another round of optimization. Best to be on the conservative side with the graphical settings as it still looks great even with the lower settings.

For me Lone Echo is easily the best game of the year, VR or otherwise and probably the best VR game I've ever played (and I've played a ton of them). It shows how a properly made VR game can pull you into its world in ways a traditional flat game never could and the characters and voice acting are all top notch, making me really vested in what happens to these people and AI's I'm interacting with. Part of me hopes we'll get a Lone Echo 3 some day, but part of me also hopes we don't as this game has one of the most beautiful, emotional endings I've experienced (TIP: don't skip the credits).",Oct 20 at 4:16 AM,5, 9,

I have about 4 hours into Lone Echo 2 so far and still am just astounded by the movement, the physics interactions, Liv's personality, the environments, all of it is top notch. The story has some similar problem solving and the scary bio goo is back and creepy as ever.

As for the graphics presets - I have an RTX2080S and when I tried to change it from ""Low"" I got a big red check mark indicating my GPU was overloaded, SO, I have been changing individual settings like shadows, texture resolution, volumetrics and bloom and am getting the look and results I am after.

*** UPDATE ***

11/13/21

After upgrading to Win11 and the latest software update on my Quest 2, the performance issues below are gone.

****
I've played for around 3 hours and have run into performance issues.    Screen smearing, often hanging for several seconds and severe drops in framerate.   I'm using a Quest 2 via Air Link and am running an RTX 3070 with 32G of ram, so I don't thinks its been for the lack of horsepower.  

I've played with the Quest 2's refresh rate in the Oculus app and turned it to the recommended rate of 72hz.  This cleaned up most of the performance issues, though slight stutter did happen when loading large amounts of assets but it wasn't bad.

Though playing at 72hz does make me feel a bit queasy, I've still enjoyed the game.  I don't think this is an acceptable work around but it does work.  I do hope Ready at Dawn address these performance issues in a patch.

As for the game itself, despite the above performance issues it is a truly first rate VR game and one of my favorite.  Olivia is such a believable and likeable character that you just want to spend time talking and finding out more about her.  

The character banter is interesting, inteligent and heart warmingly humorous.  The voice cast is superb and downright flawless.   Puzzles are well thought out, challenging but not more so than they should be.

The developers and cast have done a remarkable job of breathing life into these characters.  When Olivia is, at times in danger, you absolutely want to protect her as your pulse quickens and you race to help her.  Because of VR's sense of presence, Olivia to me feels like the most believable and ""real"" characters I've ever met in a video game. (And I've been playing them since the late 70s!)

This title is by far the best game (VR or other) I've played since Halflife Alyx, and it may top that one once these performance issues are ironed out. 5/5!",Nov 14 at 1:28 AM,5, 2,

Low and behold it’s arrived! I’ve spent several days playing it and just finished the game tonight!

They did a tremendous job of encapsulating and immersing you into the story just like in the original! You have the same awestriking views to admire however the area has a lot more size and chance for exploration and there’s side objectives and secret areas  too which is a fantastic touch! You also have more tools at your disposal which you acquire as you progress through the story and are also upgradable while you’re out exploring! 

Graphics are superb! Voice acting is awesome and the story itself.. there are no words to describe how creative and futuristic it is! It absolutely sucks you in! For anyone who has played the original and enjoyed it you’ll be mind blown by this sequel! For anyone who hasn’t played the first one, I definitely recommend playing the original first as it’s very story focussed and the story continues after the first game and into this one.

2022-05-28 14:47:45.109663,BunglingVr,Amazing... Just absolutely astonishing!,"NOTICE: For this campaign to even make sense, you MUST play Lone Echo 1 first otherwise nothing will make sense in this ((both games cost $80 USD unfortunately))

How can I even begin to describe it... For starters, its an extension of Lone Echo 1, which I've been personally waiting for for a long time.

First off, I have had little issue with performance (AMD RX 580) even at high graphics, which the game said that I will likely experience many crashes and lag. I have only had to experience one crash near the very end of the campaign and it was a very demanding scene (its was f'ing beautiful, very amazing) I have had to experience little/decent lag but I was able to easily ignore it as I was always busy doing something, which is a very major +. One minor negative is that some textures don't pop into focus and enhance which is decently immersion breaking but you learn to ignore it eventually.

The campaign itself, (including LE1) is rather long but very enjoyable and satisfying when finished. ((partial spoilers)) You feel attached to the main characters ""Liv"" (in the thumbnail) and you feel as if you are actually ""Jack"" (robot in thumbnail)

((partial spoiler end))
I don't have much to say except that the game is a little performance heavy (RX 580) ((not sure if thats even a good gfx card)), very good campaign, an ABSOLUTE MUST if you played LE1, and just... an amazing experience ((played with rift S btw))

It is such a joy to move about in zero gravity and it feels real, all the time, no immersion breaking locomotion or gamey shortcuts at all. Event scenes are always interactive enough to keep players involved. And the environments are nicely detailed both visually and in terms of interaction.

Of course, all of this was already true of the first game, and while Lone Echo 2 is an evolution, not a revolution, it is bigger and better than the prequel in every sense. More characters, a higher stake story, and more gameplay variety.

I played on a 1660 Super, 32GB RAM, it defaulted to low graphic settings and I had smooth and consistent performance throughout my playthrough. Wireless on a Quest 2 with Air Play.

Back in the day, many action games were merely moving in a hostile environment, and everything and everyone you met inevitably wanted to kill you. There was never much explanation given on what the backstory was, you have to destroy (bluh bluh bluh) and overcome the super mega dangerous (bluh bluh bluh). I love stories. I love movies, sci fi movies especially because it's such an adventure when the whole world is different. So when I was playing games back then, I was always imagining the back story for these games, who my character was, why was everything wanting to blast me to smithereen, etc. It was enough to make it more engaging. Then games evolved, the stories became more fleshed out, but they often remained childish, more childish than my imagination anyway, and since their stories were more complete, it was harder to replace complete stories with my own imagination. So I kept looking for games whose stories would get to me. There were a few, but as I was getting older, it was less and less a ""blast"", less exciting. Fun, but I was getting old so yeah, just... fun. Then VR happened. I dreamed of VR for a decade before Oculus and the like happened. And lucky for me, Lone Echo, a great story created in a medium that was so much more impressive, so much more engaging. VR allows for emotions if used correctly, because there's no distance between you and what's happening. And greatest of all, Lone Echo was perfectly done while my love for VR hadn't yet faded. I played that game with the awe I felt when I was 8 or 9 years old. I was able to forget I was playing a game. I felt connected to Liv. What happened in that world mattered to me. This is something that pretty much doesn't happen anymore. When I finished the first Echo, I was burning to see what would happen next. Lone Echo two was what I wanted and more. It's not a game, it's basically an adventure. Thank you for it.",Oct 29 at 11:55 AM,5, 3,

2022-05-28 14:47:51.450942,pacxx03,Performance via Oculus Link a bad joke,"As far as I can tell so far, the actual game seems to be good in most parts.  The atmosphere is also very good.  BUT the performance in terms of the graphics is very disappointing.  I have a relatively good gaming PC with an RTX 2080 Super.  I play the game with my Oculus Quest 2 via Link (cable), and the performance of the graphics is only bearable in the lowest graphics setting and reduction to 80hz.  

Amazingly, the colleagues who play it with the Valve Index or HP Reverb G2 via Revive have significantly fewer performance problems.  And that's like a bad joke for an Oculus exclusive title, especially since Facebook has discontinued the Rift S and just pushed the Oculus Link solution as the only PC-VR alternative.  

Furthermore, the individual points in the Settings menu can hardly be clicked.  It is a pain and a matter of luck to get something changed.  Because the game is only in English, the (English) subtitles are particularly valuable.  But they disrupt the entire gameplay.  They are much too big, sometimes disappear in the game graphics or appear twice.  

You had 3-4 years to develop the game and have postponed the game's release several times.  Considering that Facebook only offers Quest 2 and they only officially operate PC-VR via Link, sorry but this extremely poor performance is not acceptable! 

I hope there will be a patch that fixes the problem soon, until then I will only leave it at 2 stars and can only advise all Oculus Quest 2-Link players with less than one RTX graphics card not to buy the game in this state.",Oct 13 at 10:11 PM,2, 6,

I'll preface by saying I have a 3090 with a I9 10900K and 32 gigs of ram with an NVME drive.. I didn't have any issues with this game playing it with my Index at 200% supersampling. No crashes but I did encounter some minor bugs and glitches as well as texture pop/slow texture load in the outdoor area. 

This is a worthy sequel to Lone Echo to me and takes you on an awesome ride. I have loved space games since I was a kid so for me this is like a continuation of those old adventure games from back in the day. IE Space Quest or The Dig. It reminds me of those a lot but you're actually carrying out the actions in first person...in VR instead of just typing some command lines. So that has a huge nostalgic pull to me. 

Overall this game is a masterpiece to me despite its flaws. Yes it can be tedious, yes it has some issues with texture pop in, yes its performance is not great, but overall it's an incredible experience imo. Really love the voice acting, and there's some great dialogue, especially on the main quest. (Yes there's some that tends to drone on). Really love the Apollo parts and the ending sequence is an epic ride.  Quite the bang to end the rift games on.",Oct 21 at 10:39 PM,5, 4,

If the first installment was VR Game of the Year, this is VR Game of the Century.  Simply put, you are the main character in an absolutely EPIC sci-fi film.  Honestly, I didn't think Lone Echo could be outdone - but this was longer and the environments were the most detailed and massive I've ever seen in any PC experience.  It would be an insult to the hundreds of artists who worked years on this project to call it a ""game.""  At no time did I feel like I was playing a game or even in a simulation.  The graphics, plot, cinematography, muscial score, sound effects, character development, set design, script, and voice acting were as good as any Hollywood film.  There were so many ""wow"" moments where you say, ""I can't believe that just happened.""  In particular, the interaction between Jack and Liv (and others) is incredibly realistic and natural.  Anyone who is a fan of science fiction films will fall in love with every second of Lone Echo II.

The bottom line ... this title belongs in every VR collection.  When it was finished, I felt just like I do when I walk out of an awesome summer movie - except the adrenaline was amped up to eleven, because I experienced it all first-hand.  It was an emotional, immersive roller coaster ride along the rings of Saturn.  There is no doubt that Lone Echo II was worth the long wait.  A heartfelt thanks to everyone at Ready at Dawn.  They all deserve a lifetime achievement award.

And goodness gracious ... watch the credits all the way through or - just like the Marvel series - you'll miss the Easter egg finish at the end!",Nov 2 at 8:16 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 14:47:54.637549,thomasg86,A Worthy Follow Up!,"If you liked the original, this is a must play. A great narrative story that continues the Jack and Liv story. This sequel is a bit meatier than the original, clocking in at about 9 hours for me. If you are more of a completionist, you will get an additional hour or two.

Graphics are gorgeous but could use a little work on the optimization. Don't be afraid to dial things back a bit, it still looks amazing. The mechanics are much the same as the first game but you are given new tools and new ways to interact with the environment. The locations are largely familiar but this time around you'll be completing many different tasks. There is also a bit of an open world element which is a nice switch up from the original.

Overall, one of the better titles in PCVR, right up there with the original. Two big robotic thumbs up!",Nov 2 at 11:01 AM,5, 2,

Until this gets patched for optimisation, I cannot recommend this game as it becomes a very unpleasant experience.

Despite this game being such a GB hog and making my PC hum like a vaccum, I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone considering it.

2022-05-28 14:48:00.995282,Hoshi82,Terrible Performance Issues,"First things first: This is a 4/5 star game... BUT

The performance of this game is a total mess. The recommended specs are:

Intel i7-6000 equivalent or greater
NVIDIA GTX 1080 equivalent or greater
16.00 GB

my specs are:
Ryzen 9 3900x
RTX 2080ti
32gb DDR4

So it's more than enough to get this baby running and still this game stutters and give reprojection like hell. It doesn't matter if I play with my Quest 2 + Link, or with my Valve Index + Revive. Same results, same poor performance.

The first odd thing that I noticed ingame was that video settings were all on LOW. So as you do you start ramping up these settings and the first thing I changed to HIGH, which was Texture Details, the ingame icon for the GPU got instantly a red cross to tell me, my GPU isn't good enough.
Remember, recommended 1080, me using a 2080 ti and this was the FIRST option, everything else was still on low. Setting all to MEDIUM gives a yellow indicator on my GPU. CPU, RAM, ect. all fine, but no no no no your tiny GPU isn't good enough.

Setting all to HIGH makes it playable but far from enjoyable. All on LOW makes the game look ugly. But even on setting on High makes the FPS drop, so there is some serious problem with the optimization.

As soon as the game gets patched and fixed, this review will definitly change, but for now... just wait until this game is optimized. Even LE1 runs silk smooth but not LE2.",Oct 13 at 11:07 PM,2, 23,

2022-05-28 14:48:04.122043,Ravenger,An incredible experience,"I loved Lone Echo, and Lone Echo 2 builds on the foundations in that game, adding much more to do with more varied tools and puzzles. The same excellent zero-g movement mechanics return, and the sense of immersion is second to none. The graphics and audio are truly AAA in quality - a major step up from most other VR titles.

The game has a 'metroidvania' element where you will encounter areas that you can't access immediately, and which you need to unlock abilities to access. This along with various 'collectables' that help you gain abilities really encourages exploration, and adds a lot to the game over the first one.

However the best bit about the game (as in the first) is the excellent writing and performances coupled with the facial and mocap animation which leads you to form a real emotional bond with the characters. This may be a story set in space but it's ultimately a story about friendship, and is an incredible emotional ride.

2022-05-28 14:48:04.139995,magnadude,Amazing VR game,"This is the game by which many future VR games will be measured.
I can understand why it would take so long to release.  The sheer amount of detail and the combined labor hours involved must have been immense, because this is the kind of game that makes it impossible to fill in the gaps with procedurally generated content like what seems to have been done with games like No Man's Sky, (also a pretty good perpetual work in progress, although in many ways the comparison is like apples and oranges). Unfortunately, due to the complexity, Lone Echo 2 still has a few wrinkles to iron out, but it's nothing game breaking, and definitely not deal breaking.   Even with the little issues though, it's still likely to be a trend setter in VR gaming.  I can kind of see it also being one of those perpetual works in progress, which I don't really mind.  It does require fairly hefty hardware to run though.  I'm using a gaming laptop with a Ryzen 9, 40GB system memory, and the new Nvidia RTX3080 with 8GB GDDR graphics memory, and I can still only run it on medium settings without it being all jittery.

- The game can be played on my rig on up to Medium Graphical Settings with no noticeable frame skips.  The graphics are more than serviceable, given my aging graphics card.  
- Game controls are adequate, and mostly do a solid job. The main complaint is the pitch control which moves at only one speed: fast. The roll capability is an absolute blast to use, and literally puts a new perspective on any level I am on.
- The game was stable from start to finish with no with no crashes, but did experience a few 'loading screen' pauses during gameplay.
- My first experience with PCVR was Lone Echo on a Rift, and what an experience it was. It literally introduced me into a new universe, and hooked myself to VR ever since.
- Nearly 4 years later, I am re-introduced to this universe, with feelings of joy and bittersweet sadness.  Joy because no one fleshes out a space opera like this developer; bittersweet because no other developer has done a space opera like this since Lone Echo I.
The game is quite enjoyable, is highly immersive, and begs further exploration to discover everything that has been created.  One down side is that the general gameplay mechanics did not evolve much beyond the original game, aside from a a few, new, neat tools.  It was unfortunate the majority of the game was doing 'fetch quests' in a absolutely gorgeous environment, but the immersion and scope alleviated this annoyance.
- When I mentioned 'space opera', scenes where I am playing Jack while literally between Liv and the Doctor, and seeing the emotions and expressions on their faces made me feel connected to this game in a manner few games have done. I started to feel like I have a personal stake in the game, and that a successful outcome is important to myself.

This game is an amazing continuation of the original and really expands on the lore of the lone echo universe (or I guess echo universe as a whole). It's neat seeing the echo combat units be involved as well as our favorite ship AI ;). Where I feel this game falls short though is it's gameplay pacing as well as the conflict. I constantly found myself waiting around for characters and dialogue to catch up. And it's not even that I was going fast it just felt like how much I could explore was defined and slowed by the characters. Also, the conflict in the story felt.. nonexistent; artificial. While it does expand on the time travel aspect a bit more I would have loved to have part of the game show the reality of life after the infection, rather than just hinting at it from time to time. I would have also loved more time with the combat units. That likely would have been an interesting side plot and I wish we could have seen more of that. I was never worried about any of the characters since bad things only ever happened when they WEREN't around. The ending (which I refuse to spoil) was a rather interesting twist that left a bad taste in my mouth; that waaas until after the credits which while it did cheer me up.. definitely had a few plot holes.

Yes, there are some technical issues, but nothing that's really game breaking.

To all players with performance and technical issues: Try to disable ""Adaptive Resolution"" in the settings. At least for me, this did the trick (3060Ti). It doesn't solve the problem with textures loading too late or not at all, but aside from that, everything ran smoothly for me after having deactivated this setting. Before, it was borderline unplayable.

Once i was done with the first hour I could not stop.

2022-05-28 14:48:13.675837,CasualCheetah,It's certainly more Lone Echo...,"It's certainly more Lone Echo, but the sequel doesn't change much of what we've already seen.

There's a truly excessive amount of dialogue throughout Lone Echo 2. Most of it is delivered via planning, directions, or affirmation instead of expressing emotions for a real story. Furthermore, it gets hard to stay engaged when every progressing event is preceded by a complication that's both horribly tragic and easy for the player to circumvent. 

The value of gameplay pales in comparison to the emphasis Lone Echo 2 places on its presentation. It was exciting to receive new tools, but even the sparse applications of these mechanics can begin to feel repetitive. The appealing idea of “space maintenance” doesn’t extend beyond following directions or looking around for objects. I would go as far as to say that there are no multi-step ‘puzzles’ in Lone Echo 2.

Despite all those complaints, the primary draw of Lone Echo 2 has to be its scenery and, pun intended, atmosphere. Being adrift in various complex sci-fi settings is a uniquely VR feeling. At a higher resolution on more powerful hardware, I imagine this sensation would be even grander. (The game also runs reasonably well on the original Rift with older hardware.)

Ultimately, the game is mostly an interactive ‘experience’ whose simplicity might be a perk for some audiences. If you're looking for more of Lone Echo's space-narrative and don't mind some mundanity, this sequel will fit the bill.",Oct 15 at 7:02 AM,4, 3,

I looked at Youtube videos explaining the best free games on the oculus store to get and Echo VR happened to be one of them. I play the game repetitively so much to the point where I am more than interested about the origins of the game that I eventually get into contact with people who had played on the ""original predecessor"" version of Echo VR. I was later informed that the game had first started off as a solo campaign about space exploration and the origins behind how Echo VR came to be and that the title in mind was Lone Echo. I had bought the game not knowing that it had LOTS of easter eggs hinting towards Echo VR before the game had it's multiplayer release indicating two teams colored in both blue and orange opposing each other as a well known 0-G sport. I then complete the Lone Echo campaign left on a huge cliffhanger, hoping that there might have been a second game already out I was sadly mistaken. Looking at videos all over the internet explaining the delays that Ready at Dawn had been experiencing i was more than happy to paitently wait for a game that had held me at a shocked state at how impressive the first game's experience actally was and soon enough the Lone Echo II release came out and I was surprised to see so many returning elements come back from Lone Echo and more or less had some outstanding reworks!",Oct 19 at 8:56 AM,5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:48:16.842485,Maej78,A worthy successor to Lone Echo 1,"The first Lone Echo blew me away as one of the first VR games I played. Years and many games later the expectations were high and Lone Echo 2 delivered. I was hooked right from the start and couldn't stop playing till the end. The story was captivating and the gameplay fun. It feels bigger and more open than LE1, there is also more variety, and a good narrative that unfolds as you play. The graphics even on the default low are breathtaking and the controls are sublime.

There are some issues though, nothing game-breaking for me, just a little irritating, but hopefully they will be fixed.
Sometimes objects would fail to load their HD textures making them appear as fuzzy amorphous blobs. This happened often with the base generator section for me, sometimes with the ship and asteroids too. I found it was usually fine at first but got worse the longer I played, so occasional restarts would help, though I never really found it getting in the way, just a minor irritation.
I also suffered from occasional crashes where the headset would lock up for a second then go blank and the computer would restart itself a few seconds later, though this might be my hardware as it turns out my Rift cable is damaged and spares are no longer available. This would happen perhaps once every 3 hours on average, so just a little frustrating really, not a game breaker.
The ending... well all I'll say is it's worth watching the credits to the end.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, to me this stands out as a beacon of how to do a VR game properly. A worthy successor to LE1 and absolutely worth the money.",Nov 3 at 8:24 AM,4, 1,

I spent a lot (a whole lot) of time listening to conversations that were really not necessary, and a lot of time sitting in blackness for upgrades or watching a countdown clock.. Yes, it is a fun game to play,  but I was left with the feeling that the game was put off until the last possible moment and then hastily thrown together.  Yes, we heard all about the delays due to covid... which I call a load of poop because covid didn't start shutting things down until after or very nearly at the original completion date.

2022-05-28 14:48:42.208000,SDC-Wutang,Tale of a Fantastic Series,"Coming from Lone Echo 1, this sequel nails the series and shows how much the developers really understands the Lone Echo brand.  The exceptional voice acting and story telling is the driver and I was giddy from the get go to reunite with the cast.  The character development really gets you to care about the different personalities.  Without spoiling anything, I shed a tear at the end and was choked up several times during the experience.

Motion mechanics is what you'd expect from Lone Echo - pretty fluid and intuitive.  The shooting mechanics are so-so, but I guess appropriate for the context.  Jack is not suppose to be a killer robot!  The puzzles were fun and didn't feel forced.  The dialogue can take a bit at times to finish before you can complete the next action.  There's a wierd system for switching tools that's slow and clunky and it's not easy to just whip out a tool.  I guess you're suppose to prepare.   

All that said, this title was well worth it's value!  

My PC specs are below.  I'm able to run graphics on the highest setting.  However the framerate is not ideal.  Running on medium setting seems to be good for my hardware.

2022-05-28 14:48:45.307830,PaperPancakeBoy,Big Beautiful Game That Is Worth It!,"The game worked wonderfully for me, only a few crashes or performance issues, the ingame loading zones where unfortunate though and did take like a minute to load but thats probably because my settup isnt that good, the loading when loading into the savefile did take a long time however!


GAMEPLAY
The gameplay was good, the puzzles where challenging and the tools where good 

WARNING SPOILERS
The ticks where fun and i really paniced in the event that there are 5 ticks around me and im trying to rush to a powersource hehe... anyways the 'curing gun' was really fun because it made the ticks just a fun inconvenience.


OK BACK TO REVIEW WITHOUT SPOILERS (FOR NOW)!
The environments where beautiful and suited the game well, the only problem is that almost everything is a shade of grey so finding vents or switches was challenging!


TAlKING ABOUT THE STORY (NO SPOILERS)
ok so the story is very much like the first one, just miles and miles better and more emotional. Also the ending made me generaly almost cry lol


anyways thanks for reading",Oct 16 at 5:38 PM,5, 1,

It has great gameplay, introduces combat and continues the story in a great way. It has an incredibly emotional story and really makes you think about what just happened. It has more tools and they are much easier to use. You can switch through different Echo models as the game progresses and is 100% worth the price. If you want to get this game make sure to play it COMPLETLY BLIND for the best expirence. But it is not all good, it does have a few bugs, characters can go through walls, and sentences can get interupted if you go too fast. And from what a few of my friends have told me, your gonna need a very good computer and it is best played with link for a good connection.

I have played it for several hours then for no reason, I lost the ability to grab using the left controller.  Everything else works with the left controller, pointing, using the cutter, thrusters etc. But when I try to grab the environment it doesn't work.  Which is strange because the button works and the hand goes into a fist when pressing the button and not trying to grab. I am currently in a location where you need to grab a crane with one hand and move it with another. So I am stuck. I have powered down the quest 2 and also removed / replaced the battery on the controller.  Tried it with Air Link and also with Virtual Desktop, same issue.

LE1 was one of my favorite games in VR, only held back slightly by its short length. LE2 has a lot more side missions and side objectives that make exploring a massive open world very rewarding. The story is more on the foreground too, with brilliant voice acting and mocapping by multiple actors. The graphics are the best I have ever seen, even outclassing Alyx. The performance is good too, on my rtx2080 it runs on medium settings and fairly high resolution without any issue at 80hz. The initial load time is very long though (30-40 seconds). 

The only real downside I can think of is that they left the serious tone of the first game behind a bit and changed it to a netflix/Disney level of humor that sort of misses the mark for anyone over the age of 14.",Oct 17 at 4:43 AM,5, 1,

But I use an Oculus Quest 2 with a link cable, so I would recomend the Oculus Rift to be used with this game. Something bugging me though is that when I paid for it, a second 10 dollar transaction came through, and the original $40 is still pending. I bought only the game instead of the bundle (because I didnt realize there was a bundle). So I dont know if that has something to do with the game or not, all I know is the extra transaction happened right when I bought the game, and I bought nothing else.",Oct 17 at 4:44 AM,4, 1,

The game is amazing and continue directly after part 1. It's a must have who played the first one and the story seems to be great (until now) and I love it! At the latest when the second person showed up, I was thrilled and could hardly believe my eyes how real and detailed he was! Amazing and a must-buy, highly recommended!
