Plays smoothly and is the best sweeper game so far. I think that in keeping with the original, the cleared blocks should be invisible and the solid blocks should be unknowns (it is the opposite in this game). This would just make more sense and easier to see what is left to clear. I like the 3d aspect but it is made too easy to just do one plane at atime, which sort of makes it pointless to try to solve in 3d. When it lets you do one plane at a time its just a set of easy 2d puzzles. It seems that the 3d problem is that you cant see through blocks.... maybe if they were semi transparent then you could really visualize all the blocks that touch in 3d. Also really need high score lists to compete against your personal best times....... I know I ask for a lot, but I would really love to get into this game if it were really done right. Totally worth it anyway, thanks.","Feb 16, 2021 at 10:19 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:39:03.826312,willchil,Lots of fun!,"This is a very accurate recreation of the classic game in VR! Bringing minesweeper to 3D keeps the fun of the old mechanics, while introducing a fresh, new way to play. Easy to recommend!","Feb 7, 2021 at 9:36 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:39:03.840275,eskdale4,Good Fun,"Exactly as described, minesweeper but in 3D.  Controls take some getting use, to but plays well once you have figured them out.","Feb 7, 2021 at 4:34 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:39:03.856232,cadecade09,Not great,"Caant say i think this is worth the money, I really like regular MS but this is not great. If a 2d option was added it would be worth the money but 3d minesweeper is not the most fun thing on the planet.","Feb 6, 2021 at 12:03 PM",2, 1,"Hello, thanks for your review!
Fortunately, SweeperVR does include a 2D mode, as it can be quite difficult in 3D alone. Hold grip on your primary controller, and drag perpendicular to any plane to isolate it in 2D. You can also check out the controls page on the menu for more information."
2022-05-28 20:39:03.870268,Doootman,Love This!!,This game is awesome! I played a lot of regular minesweeper back in the day and this is a perfect adaptation of it. 10/10 would recommend.,"Feb 7, 2021 at 9:31 AM",5, 1,
