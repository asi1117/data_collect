2022-05-28 13:26:50.189582,Colintve,One of the best titles,"I have over 900 VR titles in my collection (I run a VR Centre) and I stopped playing this when stuck on level 2 when I bought it. Much later, I bothered to watch a walkthrough to get past that. Now Im much further in and found it to be one of the very best titles I own. So polished, well thought out, dramatic sequences, in depth story, and excellent UI makes this one of my very favourite games. At the new price, and with added save points (they listened to comments) I would recommend this to any VR owner who likes action and spy movies. This is Mission Impossible in VR, without the licensing.",Oct 16 at 12:44 AM,5, 32,

From oculus link or air link the game doesn't launch and I don't know why!
from virtual desktop, it launch but it's perfectly unplayable cause it's so laggy that it take fifteen minutes just to make it to the main menu.
Plus the oculus support doesn't want refund cause the game start with virtual desktop even if it's unplayable.

Those 3 levels alone made it worth every penny. You have fighting, gambling, deception, conversations, etc. However, the last 2 levels were pretty lackluster. It was mostly centered around combat and nothing much else, which kinda ruined them for me, considering the quality of the first 3 levels.

Some parts of this game (some of the best) almost feel like advertisements for it. Moments when you get to experience hand-to-hand combat and parlour games. Defector is a decent title, it's on the cheap side for a VR game, and I don't regret buying it. But it is short, and knowing these developers, I feel it is trying to be something that it's not. Twisted Pixel are comedians, their games flourish when they are joking around. Defector tries to tell a serious espionage story, and I think it suffers for it. I would recommend the aformentioned Path of The Warrior over this. Might just be me, if this game really looks/sounds like your kind of thing then by all means buy it. Theres nothing wrong with it, and I'm not going to advise you to steer clear.","Apr 9, 2021 at 12:36 AM",3, 6,

Had no problem at all with the stationary targets. When they start moving however they become LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HIT. I have tried everything possible to progress past this section. I have gotten in closer, aimed carefully at the targets, just fired wildly. I HAVE WITNESSED MY BULLETS PASSING THROUGH TARGETS.

well, the story is there though it just kinda not really related each stage, or it's only me that's not really pay attention.
this game has it all, from shooting, gambling, boxing, massage (yes, massage. u know u want it *wink *wink), etc, but all is kinda shallow and so small doses that would leave u wanting but never actually satisfy u.
it's a jack of all trades but a master of none.

it has multiple ending and multiple branch of story though. But I got fed up only after trying 2 endings (only try branching on the last choice). all this only took me about 4 hours.

the game is kinda heavy too. I couldnt play this on vd without lag, has to use cable link to play it.

However, I have some minor complaints. I can run this game on ultra and it still looks somewhat white washed. Not sure if it's my brightness setting or what but it is distracting and takes me out of the immersion. There were also times where I couldn't see my trainer when I was learning the fighting techniques.

Overall, this game will let anyone live out there dreams of being a spy. I can't wait for something like this with the quality of Alyx: Half Life. Still a great effort by the developer!","May 26, 2021 at 8:45 AM",4, 0,

Not for open world, sim or PvP gamers, but a must-buy for anyone who likes a quality single player, narrative driven action/adventure on rails.

It's too short, though it's designed to give you a completely different experience the 2nd time thru, based on choices that you make, so that helps.

2022-05-28 13:27:12.402901,Motymor,A campy action movie in VR.,"Defector is quite a mixed experience. With some fun setpiece moments and generally fun arcade gampleay its easy to have a good time while playing, but a decrease in level quality after the first few and a general lack of content (about 3-4 hours) bring the experience down.

The first, second and third levels are really fun with some insane action setpieces and a fun variety of gameplay, they do a good job of making you fell like you're in a mission impossible movie, but this quality is not held up through the later levels. After that the levels arent great, the somewhat entertaining story jumps the shark and the gamplay devolves into some pretty terrible stealth and some overlong and boring shooting galleries.

There's only 5 levels in the game, meaning almost half of them kinda suck. Though there is only 5 levels, 4 of them have ""branching points"". These are mid-mission choices you can make, deciding between two completely different setpiece moments within one level, this adds some cool replayability to the levels. With the exception of one all of both coices in each level are equally fun.

The shooting is simple but fun amd feels like an arcade on rails shooter at times but in the best possible way. Theres some hand to hand combat sequences which  were always very fun and some interesting talking/dialogue scenes where you have to stay undercover or get information. Though the dialogue scenes do become tedious and boring on repeat playthroughs, they are fun the first time.

in summary the pros and cons are...
Pros:
+fun shooting
+great setpiece moments and branching gameplay
+action movie feeling
+fun conversations (the first time)
+great hand to hand combat sections
+great variety of gameplay in the first 3 levels
Cons:
-not much content
-levels degrade in quality
-repetitive gameplay in later levels

Overall, defector is a short but fun game with some glaring issues. Buy it on sale if it looks interesting, i bought it at full price and got my moneys worth.","Sep 15, 2020 at 9:35 AM",3, 22,

Although there are only 5 missions, each one easily takes 30-60 minutes to complete, and has 2 different endings. This gives the game a great replay potential.

However, 
For $20 i would expect a flushed out vr experience with a decent few hours of gameplay and some replayability. I beat the game in under 3 hours, and was able to run through making the other choice in all the missions and unlocking just about everything within another 2-3. 
I will admit that like others have said the missions go downhill after the first 3 becoming less original and interesting.

The set pieces are well done, but it's how you play them in the end that matters. If you just stand there and look for targets, the whole game is a rail shooter. If you actually engage and half pretend you're Bond or Atomic Blonde or (gulp) Ethan Hunt, then it gets an extra star. Siding by and shooting at black ops while people freak out never gets old. My big gripe is hate, hate, hate bad save spots. And when matched with those annoying droid security alert things, it just makes a headache a migraine. That said, it's a blast in small doses. I feel a port to Quest would give it another star as it begs to be played more freely. I'm still waiting for the AAA spy Bond VR.","Jun 5, 2020 at 3:27 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 13:27:21.871474,TheLuckyBow-Tie,In two words: A Mess.,"Look, there are parts of this game I enjoy. When I get that genuine feeling of espionage, holding some out the window of a building try to get information out of them. Sneaking through a spy plane's security and then getting to jump out of it. That stuff is fun.

The rest of this game isn't. The first disappointment I had - one that lasted through the game - was how many object I couldn't interact with. I get that it could be an oversight to make the soap dispenser work, or the sink actually have flowing water, but I can only remember one object I could interact with in the opening of the game; an object that was copied and pasted multiple times in the same room.

A small complaint, I guess, but being able to interact with the world is one of the selling points of VR. Other than that, some missions are downright awful, some are mediocre, and some are entertaining. Most fall into the mediocre category.

Checkpoints are placed far too far apart and make you recomplete obnoxious sections of the level, there are boring dialogue sequences inbetween actual gameplay (nevermind how nonsensical and vague the plotline is), and one particular section of the game made me feel silly, which is surprisingly difficult to achieve in VR. --Light Spoiler-- The level has you short circuit a giant death robot and yank its arm off to use as a gun. It's incredibly hard to aim and boring to fire, considering the actual fire-arms (mind the pun) you can pick up after killing enemies. It was stupid.

If you really, really like the idea of an espionage spy game, buy it on sale. Otherwise, there are a lot of other great games for you to get.","Jun 15, 2020 at 12:01 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 13:27:21.933813,Le_Nantec,Play dice and massage a dude in VR! Yay.,"Do you want to play dice and massage a dude?
Because this is the kind of thing this game makes you do for 15-20 minutes before reaching the action/James Bond-like content.

Every chapter starts with slow pace investigation and ends in an action sequence.
It works very well in the first chapter because then all you do is spy-like.
But starting from chapter 2, the game requires you to do dumb things like playing dice to earn money (really, they sent you in mission without money?) or massage someone. 
The game is also terrible at explaining what to do in these mini-games, and can be rather unforgiving. For example when I had to massage the defector, if I didn't find the right hand movement for about 7 seconds, they guy would find out I was undercover and kill me.
Later I interrogate the guy by shaking him through an open window. I shook the guy in all directions without ever managing to scare him into talking (it's a stupid minigame with some kind of gauge).

And the action sequences? Very Arcade - which I don't mind. But so far it seems like half of them are actually fun.
The story/chracters writting ranges from poor to OK. I would have forgiven it if the gameplay was fun.

Good idea, terrible execution.","Jun 5, 2020 at 6:47 AM",2, 1,

Many people have the complaint that the game is only about 4 hours of gameplay, but it is longer than that in a sense. A simple decision can take the mission in a different direction, essentially giving an entirly new mission to play though. For example, in the first mission, you choose to go one way, or another. Go one way, and you are climbing up a dangerous place while evading objects, but go another, and you are in a sports car, shooting baddies left and right. This occurs in many of the missions, plus you can explore, find hidden stuff, and use said stuff to complete certain objective for bonus points. 10/10, would highly recommend.","Mar 29, 2020 at 5:24 PM",5, 6,

One good thing is the fighting, the fighting is awesome and really fun but its only used like 3 times which is a shame since few vr games allow hand to hand combat. Another thing i will say is how the missions are so the first mission is amazing and so are the next few but the last one goes quite off the rails and gives you these gauntlets that shoot and have a blade made of fire and you have to fight robots which isnt what I want to as its a spy game.

If the game was twice as long it would be worth it for three times the price.  It's a fantastic thrill ride that I already can't wait to play again.  Just a couple things to consider: while it has an option for teleporting, some moments may be too intense for the really motion sensitive out there.  Another: the penultimate mission IS disappointing.  When there's only five missions having one without any branching options that drops you right in after the tension escalation has occurred feels short-changing.  They're denying the gamer much needed storytelling in an already fairly short experience.  That said, everything else is flawlessly executed.  They've taken us off the rails (one of my complaints with Wilson's Heart) and brought they're perfectly executed physical interaction with them.

2022-05-28 13:27:56.674066,FRAGGADOCIOUS,THIS IS LANDMARK IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY,"This is the first actual full game that I have played in vr. I have oculus, gear and psvr.  Every game that I have played until this point has been one dimesional and repetitve. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed a lot of these games. The developers have been creative with a lot of titles. Robo recall for instance. Super fun but its not a splinter cell, dying light, zero dawn or far cry.

Defector has layers and variety. You fist fight, drive (a little), sneak, shoot, hack, chase a villian through city streets and more. The dialogue gets cheesy but you won't mind. I have to be honest,  if this were a non vr game, I would not give it a good review. I am giving it a good review because this is the first VIRTUAL REALITY game that I have ever played that even attemps to give the depth and variety that you get in a good non vr game like the games I mentioned before. AND because its more than just an attempt, I was entertained. If this is an indicator of where vr is going, I am very exited. I TOTALLy recommend purchasing this game.

I know how challenging this game must have been for the developers. I want them to keep trying. We need to support this game so they will keep making vr games like this. Also the game IS WORTH PLAYING. the mechanics of the game are good everything flows well. The graphics are what they should be. The stroryline...  IT ACTUALLY HAS A STORYLINE. This is my first VR game with an actual storyline not just a backstory. It is not the best or worst storyline, you act out the story through the game. I think that was pretty smart of the developers to do it that way.  VR games or very cumbersome from a computing standpoint that is why we see a lot of shallow games.  The developers used their limited resources ingeniously when they made this game.

2022-05-28 13:27:56.690023,BreakMaker,Loved it!,"Seeing the trailer video from Free Fall... really made me excited about this game. Seriously I was looking every othe day when this would released. And when finally did and I completed the first level, and was REALLY satisfied. All the action, the conversation sequences and first and foremost, the fist fight.

Well of course, everything is kept very simple. You cannot really make a mistake in the conversations. The puzzles are super simple. But just by doing all of them, the game can really give you a feeling that you are a master spy. This is what this game was about for me... the experience in the moment regardless of you would replay this game. 

It is true the arc of tension has a huge valley at around the middle of the game. I found the robot levels boring myself. But acutally it is better to have a high at the beginning and a high at the end. Having said that, I did not really like the branch I chose in the end, but the surpising final scene still give it a nice finish.

I wonder how many of the users checked out the extra content. Even if it is not hours more, it is still way more than in other games. Just checking out the 3d models, or the art concepts and the hilarious test levels.

The bottom line is, in spite of the imperfactions this game offered some really unique moments of experience that I will never forget. Many other VR games I played... I cannot even remember just one thing..","Sep 6, 2019 at 5:36 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:27:56.707483,JuicyFruit40,Best Single Player since Lone Echo.,"The title of this review says it all. I know there are other good shooters out there thats been around for awhile now. But this game was my first true fps VR experience. I held off on others until i seen something that truly caught my eye. And this game did just that. I love how you can litterally hold your gun out around the corner of a wall and fire off at your enemies. The only two small cons i see in this game is a small tracking issue i get when holding an assault rifle with both touch controllers but that could be an isolated issue for me since i only have two sensors setup for ""Front Facing"" type gameplay. The second being when you come across ammo crates make sure to NOT drop the ammo clips you want to keep and move on with, they will disappear instantly, So be careful of that. This game looks great graphically and comes extremely close to as polished as Lone Echo was in the beginning. Pick this one up. If not now, most certainly when they finally have it one sale!","Jul 12, 2019 at 12:27 PM",5, 26,

I'm mostly a multiplayer VR guy so I was hesitant, especially after dropping $40 on Blood and Truth. This game is what Blood and Truth wanted to be. Totally renewed my faith in an action story single player game. Each mission is unique and adds new mechanics so nothing ever feels stale.

2022-05-28 13:27:59.835234,Wolfe_Lord,"Had high hopes, fell short","When I origianlly saw the trailer for this game on oculus, I thought it looked amazing. However upon purchase I found the gameplay to be boring and repetitive. The story assumed you knew so many things about the characters and the world and while it didnt punish you very harshly for choosing the incorrect option, the restarting from checkpoint and having to rewatch a cutscene was annoying after a certain point. There was also no sense of urgency, I found myself taking my time in most of the missions because I had no reason or desire to do otherwise. The combat consisted of mabey 5 different weapons most of which you dont even use more than once depending on the routes you take. The only unique combat system whatsoever was the blocking and attacking during melee fights which yet again depending on your path you may only encounter around 3 of. The combat was also Incredibly easy, I found myself using only around 4 health packs the entire game and one of the four was on accident. I probably only died 12 times max out of the 6-7 levels and most of the deaths were just from being bored during combat and not immediately killing enemies. The segment with the enemy drones on the final mission was incredibly easy and you could almost just walk straight through certain sections without dying or even getting hit for that matter. Your 'choices' only effect the outcome of the game in mabey 1-3 different points which seems like whatever attempt there was at making a choice story driven game was just not given any significant and detailed thought. The instructions were unclear in many segments and I found myself questioning what to do in many segments with the objectives tab providing no assistance.","Jul 13, 2019 at 11:13 AM",1, 16,

2022-05-28 13:27:59.901058,PantherModern242,Double O-k,"First decent VR game that I have bought and played through.  Graphically good, but not quite to the standard of say robinsons journey or Lone Echo.. Sound / music is excellent, gameplay is at times really good, at times not so good.. couple of control related bugs here or there that frustrated me until I realised quitting and reloading the game would fix it..  Some of the levels, like the 1st one exiting plane and the ensuing battle was awesome, the chases later and climbing, really fun.. some of it like the npc chat and debrief conversational choices seem pretty pointless.. overall, its a good game for VR, if this had been say a regular viewed game on a monitor, it would have sucked bad in comparison to the quality of games available there.  Still, I don`t want to discourage the developer or potential players, I had fun, it wasn`t too expensive.. a few more levels like the planes etc would have made it much more fun, that was definitely some of the most exciting action I`ve had in VR yet.  You could do a lot worse than buying this game compared to some of them in the occy store and steam vr.","Sep 5, 2019 at 1:17 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 13:28:03.030264,SDC-Wutang,Poor performance on recommended hardware,"The first mission played great but on the second mission the frame rate was all over the place.  It was barely playable.  There is another review that says the same.  I found myself constantly going into the graphics settings to hit restore defaults.  This seems to alleviate the issue for a few minutes but then it's back!  The screen starts to look all watery and then movement slows to a crawl.  I'm already running the lowest setting, which is ""standard"".  

I was really looking forward to this release but I am highly disappointed at the moment with it's performance.  I really cannot enjoy it as it's meant to be enjoyed.  Hoping for a driver optimization patch or something.  

My computer is as follows:

Gigabyte Z170X Gaming 7 Rev1.1 BIOS F22m
Intel i7-6700K
32 Gb Ram
EVGA Nvidia GTX 1060 OC
M2 solid state C:

I've also made sure all of my drivers are up to date, including BIOS.  My rig exceeds the recommendation, yet the game runs horribly.

Update:  So after upgrading to an RTX 2070 Super I've got to say, the graphics in this game sucks!  Even though I can run smoothly now, the graphics are still blurry on Ultra.  This thing is a HOG!  And unnecessarily so because the details are unimpressive even on Ultra.  Compared to other AAA titles such as Lone Echo and Asgard's Wrath, the graphics are obviously inferior.","Oct 15, 2019 at 7:48 AM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 13:28:03.047218,SilvioRCR,VR is not for the whole world... yet.,"I'm sure the game would be great if I had the chance to understand the dialogues well. In traditional gaming it is obvious that a game has multilanguage, even the most ""home made"" indies have multilanguage, it is an ABC that we take for granted .. in VR no instead, they continue to make games without translations and multilanguage, not it matters the budget for the game, even if it is high, like this, of the multilanguage they don't care highly. I hope that at least in 10 years they will deign to entertain even non-native English speakers. I understand too little to enjoy a game based on dialogue, plot and interrogation, I can't play, I'm sorry. I will never buy VR games with a storyline that doesn't have multilanguage, at least in the subtitles. What leaves me strange and disappointed is that you are doing a lot to make VR more user friendly and play more ""usable"" in a market accustomed to flat standards and omit absolutely essential things, which are absolute ABC, like multilanguage. Do you know that you sell a lot more if the rest of the world can understand the game? 
Do I have to spend money on games, VR headset and hardware to understand nothing? I'm starting to get fed up. There is not a single native game in this store that has an Italian translation .. ONE. In the flat we have 20 years of multilanguage, everywhere, even on smartphone games! The only thing that is in my language is the page of the headset, to attract me to buy it!
If you don't update and align with the most banal gaming standards, , like  translation into other languages, VR will always remain a niche in the shadows and this is precisely the aftertaste we have, which is so niche that we don't even design a banal standard like multilanguage. It is a bad service to sell an entertainment product in a country and not to facilitate its use in its mother tongue.
I apologize for the hardness but this situation is becoming boring.
Greetings from Italy.","Jul 13, 2019 at 11:58 AM",2, 307,
2022-05-28 13:28:03.068163,Falcon_DS_,DEFECTIVE Movement System,"I'm still going to give this game five stars because it delivers what it promises, but for Pete’s sake, give us movement OPTIONS!  
At first when I visited the options I thought great, the ability to not move in head direction is available, fantastic, I can look in one direction and move forward by the stick in the direction of the controller; NOPE!  If you choose not to use head direction and turn in real life (like we all do that are used to 360 playspace), when you press forward on the left stick it always takes your initial ‘forward position’ as its direction, so you move like a crab in that direction no matter the orientation of your controller.  This is difficult to describe, but impossible to use.  Therefore you end up needing to use head direction as direction of travel and strafe like you would with KB&M if you want to look around while walking.  This is VR for goodness sake, we have head tracking!!!  There are now 3 plains of movement we can use; 1) Forward/Back/Strafe [left stick] 2) Turn Left/Right [right stick] 3) LOOK (head).  Yet developers still insist on mimicking the inferior KB/M and standard Console Controller 2 plain system (i.e. sans look).

If you have ever fancied being James Bond 007 in VR then this title has it all. Gadgets, Story, Action and top notch production values.
At the time of this review and video (See Below) I have only played the 1st mission.

I have been hearing reports from my friends that the last 2 levels are not that great, they say they feel rushed and are more like an arcade game. 
They also say the game can be finished in around 4 hours so take all this info with a pinch of salt.

2022-05-28 13:28:06.186928,DutchDoctor,Best single player VR Experience to date,"It's good, I'm 2 missions in. The attention to detail in the world is not to be understated, this game has had a lot of love and care put into it. The art style works really well for VR, and the faces don't look uncanny like most VR games. The conversation system is immersive, similar to something like Mass Effect. The A/B Choice of mission objectives is also nice. The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a VR game, and most of that comes down to attention to detail in art design, not raw fidelity.

Audio is spot on, hand tracking is amazing. I experience absolutely no motion sickness even in the hectic ""on rails"" moments. This game has definite callbacks to Goldeneye 007 on N64 with ""Cheats"" like ""Big Head Mode"" and so on. The game has a sense of humour and doesn't take itself too seriously.

I would have expected to pay the full 60AUD for this game, but it's only 25AUD. I'd consider it a must buy.

My only request so far would be to please allow hand based locomotion, not just head. This is standard for all 360 games these days and really should be included.

EDIT: I have no finished the game. The first 2 missions felt really strong, but then as the game progressed it felt even more arcadey and unpolished. 

***SPOILERS BELOW***




The final boss fight was really underwhelming, the first fighting mechanic was cool. But the moment where you stun him and then have to throw him into things, I was actually spending upwards of 2mins straight trying to throw the guy. It just wouldn't work. The game doesn't make it clear where you're supposed to throw him, or the direction of hand action required to do so. I remember the first fist fight being really intuitive and easy, but the final boss fight felt awkward and rushed. The quality, polish and attention to detail lasted the ENTIRE way through the game I would give 5 stars.","Jul 23, 2019 at 6:47 PM",4, 6,

Judging from the fact that a bunch of reviews are 5-Star reviews I'm guessing that not everyone has these issues, but that doesn't excuse the fact that the game has so many gamebreakinfg bugs. My computer isn't even that bad! Every other VR game runs perfectly but for some reason this game just had to be a special little snowflake, didn't it Oculus Studios!?

You get to jump from crashing planes, climb on the edge of buildings and participate in many Mission Impossible style stunts and situations. Many are complaining about the length of the game. Those people don't understand basic ecomomics. VR, and especially tethered sets like the Rift S have a very small user base compared to games like Deus Ex, Mass Effect or Skyrim. In order for the devlopers to make money and have enough of a profit to make the next game, the games have to either be shorter or more expensive or both compared to traditional games.

2022-05-28 13:28:18.872524,Reffin,Can't believe I'm saying this but...,"This game is incredibly disappointing.  The story has nothing in it and yet forces you to sit through as much generic dialogue about it as there is action.  There's very little to do, but little guidance on what it actually wants you to do.  Remember that time James Bond had to stop everything to go do a fetch quest to get some guard's watch?  Me either, but that's the first 50% of the second level.  The AI is atrocious, they just stand in the same place and shoot at you until they die. I spent more time on level 3 wandering around a hotel I couldn't interact with or trying to pile objects on top of hotel guests than I did engaging with the level.  
Combat feels a lot like the old time crisis arcade games which I loved 15 years ago, but that's not what I want from a game advertised as an immersive spy experience.

I think they were going for something akin to Alpha Protocol but in VR.  The gameplay mechanics are actually pretty nice for the time period this game was released in.  Graphics are also good for the time and lots of interesting weapon choices.

The downer for me is the direction the story took.  This would have been much better with a more grounded plot and something a bit more by the numbers when it comes to an espionage/spy thriller.

Having said the above, I will definitely be replaying some of the different branches and see how it affects the story.  With better execution, I could have seen myself really looking forward to a sequel.",Sep 7 at 11:31 AM,3, 3,

It may be a tad short by some standards, but for the price tag, the replay factor with mission structure and side objectives, it's well worth twice the asking price. The cool gadgets and even the UI just make you feel so immersed and like a super spy! VR as a whole needs more ""Beat Sabers"", popular games that are done well anyone can enjoy. This is one of them.

I hope you'll give this game a try and support it. You won't regret it. Twisted Pixel GETS IT. Can't wait for their next title, or possible DLC.

We need more developers like this and we should reward them for it, I think. And again, the first couple of missions that I've played so far are absolutely worth the money (and have some replay value to it), so in comparison with other games or experiences, this one is in my opinion pretty darn good.

My main gripe with the game is level 4, as it is boring, repetitive, somwhat confusing with the start (I could not find the hit box of the enemy I am supposed to hit) and has no split path.

I am also a slight bit annoyed at how long the starting screen is (I know this isn't that important, but I have a bug with my Occulus Rift S that causes it to crash often)

There's reason to replay the game too since each mission has a decision branch to take pathway A or B thru the remainder of the mission.  So many VR games are once thru and done so this is a welcome change.  There's also unlockables tied to different challenges and tasks to do while you play the level if you're the type of person that likes to do 100% completions.  

The only two bad things i have to say are that mission #2's progression trigger is kind of bugged and the ending was kinda dumb.  The ending could have been an epic boss battle or something a lot more interesting than what it turned out to be.  The last mission as a whole was fairly boring i thought.

2022-05-28 13:28:37.916827,Neilligan,"Great for vrnewbies, Worth 20 regardless","For $20, defector is a pretty good game, although it certainly wasn't what I'd expected. 

If your looking for something like a VR hitman, keep looking. The game is pretty directed, I did find something like a side quest in one mission but you pretty much follow the directions they set out for you. You do get a choice of 2 paths in every mission, but it still feels very ""enter area. do thing earpiece guy tells you. leave area."" There's very little room to approach mission objectives creatively.

The combat parts are ok. I thought it was an odd design decision to make the best gun in the level the one they give you, and give it unlimited ammo. You can pick up other guns off of enemies, but you're limited to what's in the magazine and they're far inferior to what you're given anyway. There's not much incentive to actually pick them up, however I often did in later levels as I found them more fun to use than the super laser guns they give you. The combat itself is very arcadey, you have lots of health and mow down tons of enemies, one level has a helicopter boss that has a health bar and everything. I felt it kinda clashed with the whole spy thriller idea, and if you've been playing games like onward it feels pretty basic.

I'm still giving this game 4 stars, because while I didn't like a lot of the design decisions the game is VERY well done, and I can't fault it for not being what I personally wanted it to be. If you're looking for awesome set peices, simple run and gun action,  and cool albeit heavily scripted spy sequences you're going to be thrilled. And for $20 you really can't ask more than that.

P.S. The aesthetic is future spy, not cold war spy. I was confused going into that.","Jul 13, 2019 at 6:05 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 13:28:37.970683,Khaz_Katan,Missing interactivity kills immersion,"When I started the game I did what I always do first: I tested the interactivity of the environment. What objects can I move? How can I use them? And I was very disappointed about what this game is delivering in this aspect.
At the beginning of the game you sit at a table with a ""bad guy"" in front of you. So while he was babbling around I looked at the objects on the table right in front of me. There were apples, glasses, cutlery and such stuff. Typical objects perfect to show the physics of a game. So I lifted the tablet and... oh, all the objects on it just fell throw. Okay maybe the tablet was just an illusion. So I thought lets look how he reacts when I throw some of the objects on his ""wife"" sitting next to us (yes every character in such a game has to be a test-dummy on demand). So I threw an apple at her head: No reaction. Not from him. Not from her. Then a knife to the head: No reaction. Then a glass to the head: It broke directly on her face! Still no reaction. Yeah she is a pro as we will learn, but WTF?
Also the most of the objects lying around you cant even grab. The environment feels static and lifeless, non-responsive. And that really kills a lot of immersion for me.  With so much other games delivering much more interactivity with objects and more dynamic environments I think it should be a standard nowadays. At least thats what I'm expecting from modern non-low-budget VR titles. Yes it would be a lot of development costs to make every object ""alive"" in such a game, but at least I expect it from the objects in my direct interaction area otherwise it destroys the feeling of being connected to the virtual world. So unfortunately a lot of potential was given away here.","Jul 18, 2019 at 6:26 PM",3, 1,

The first 3 missions are good, with nice dialogue, interesting mechanics and situations already seen in movies, but the final 2 missions are like from a completely different game. Robots and futuristic weapons, and the finale is completely disappointing. The idea has potential but they need to get rid of the futuristic plot and add more violence and tortures like in the 3rd mission. Also the game is quite short, you can beat it, in 3 or 4 hours, although you can replay it taking a different route based on your decisions.

2022-05-28 13:28:41.085492,CR4FT,A wonderful but unfinished VR game,"I want to be able to give this game 5 stars because, especially at the $20 price tag, it's one of the best VR games I've played.  It explores a lot of fun mechanics that create an immersive and interesting experience.  The polish is, for the most part, really shiny and nice.  There are, however, some aspects of the game that make it feel incomplete or stale.

Just a quick list of negatives:
1.) The ammo and gun systems feel watered down and lack feel.  When reloading and shooting, the game feels like the developers went through many iterations of mechanics, and had to rush out a simplified system to meet a deadline.  Just as an example, when you look at your available magazines there's the illusion of limited supply, but it's actually unlimited. 

2.) There's some pretty clumsy waveshooting elements to the game; which is a shame because it feels a little out of place with how tight the narrative aspects are assembled.  If the AI were smarter, the health system more complex and interesting, and the gunplay tighter then some of these moments of the game could have been really exciting.  Instead, they come off as bland and almost annoying. 

3.)  Finally, while I haven't finished the game yet, I've played enough to feel like the pacing is really jerky and uneven.  All of the loading between the narrative portion and the levels feels like a late-90s title.  It makes it difficult to appreciate a lot of the aspects of a game that the title did really well.

Now, here's a quick list of things that are really great, and leave me excited for future games similar to this title.

1.) The story-branching system is neat
2.) The NPC interations, while underdeveloped, are well-done
3.) The visuals some of the best you've seen in a VR title

As clumsy as aspects of this game may be, it's absolutely worth playing.  It's one of the best VR games available, and it will give you a taste of the future of AAA VR gaming.","Jul 13, 2019 at 4:46 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 13:28:41.103444,Gabriel_Prime,Occasionally fun.,"The fun moments in this game are exhilarating but inconsistent. The devs put their best foot forward with the first mission, and that portion of the game shows the most polish. The few and far between gun play scenes are arcade-inspired fun. 

Too much of the rest of the game is met with poorly defined checkpoints to be reached in an ultra-linear fashion. The dialog trees don’t actually do anything because you’re only presented with one pathway forward. Navigating menus seems like a poor design choice that keeps things from feeling integrated. You can’t carry very many items, so rather than a menu system it would be far more immersive if you could store the items on your person—the only issue is that you’re a disembodied ghost save for your hands.  

My biggest issue with the game is that it forces you to play exactly how the developers intend with ZERO deviation. Given the previews, I was hoping for a more Hitmanesque creative experience of role playing, where the player can establish their own path in a spy thriller, but this is more of an on-the-tracks roller coaster that has far too many slowly climbing luls where you’re anticipating the next bit of punctuated excitement.","Jul 17, 2019 at 6:44 AM",3, 2,

The graphics are well done, gameplay and mechanics are good as well. 
I will say that the AI leaves a bit to be desired. 
For $20.00 you are certainly getting your money's worth. 

For those having FPS drops or issues, I am certain it just you. My system is decent but by no means anything special. 

AMD FX 8350 - 8 Core 4.2Ghz
32 GB DDR 3 (yes I said 3) 
Dual EVGA 1080 (one FTW and one Hybrid)
EVO 960 1tb

This game plays super smooth with no FPS drops or graphical issues on ULTRA.

Overall I give this title a 4/5 - I am only removing one start because I think the Physx and evironment interaction could be a bit better. The fact that I can stick my hand through the wall or some things can be picked up while others cant kind of breaks the immersion in my opinion. Other than that... Worth the money and I would have spent more..

At 20 euros getting this is a no-brainer, it's a fantastic experience and very good value for the money you're paying. Great mechanics and really cool setpieces. The bad? it has the potential  for a much bigger and longer game. It should have been a 10-12 hour game with more story, more exploration and a little more of everything. Every mission is great and varied, mostly action but you can't help but think that with more time and budget this would have been a total must-have. It still is, mind you, it's a great ride at a very cheap price, you will certainly get your money's worth out of it, probably even feel that it's too cheap for how good it is but that feeling of 'this could have been huge' is still there. Another negative is the lack of support for other languages, both voices and subtitles, something that Wilson's Heart did very well. That part will be a disappointment for non-English speakers. Other than that, an experience everyone into action games should definitely experience.","Jul 14, 2019 at 2:24 AM",5, 2,

He could not reach the handgun to draw during training in mission 1.  Please allow adjustment of those slots based on gamer height.

This is a high-quality game!  The movement mechanics are great so far and so is the gun mechanics.  At the $20 price point, this is a bargain.  Not sure how long it is, but definitely worthy of my i7-9700K + RTX2080ti.  Ultra graphics look awesome.","Jul 13, 2019 at 8:44 AM",4, 3,

People who play shooters left handed like the option of being able to move with the right stick and turn with the left stick. It seems trivial, but it really is a big deal. I would bump it up to at least 3.5 stars if this got sorted. I feel like the action and the gunplay seem not nearly as fun as I hoping for. Maybe its just the akward controls throwing me off. I'm on the fourth level, but I think I'm holding off to see if they'll patch in a left handed mode to actually enjoy it.

edit- 
FInished the game, I stand by the 2 stars. Its more a tech demo than a real game. The story is nonsensical and non existant. The gunplay isn't very fun at all and the dialogue is all boring. The first level was pretty cool with the airplane stuff though","Jul 30, 2019 at 7:59 AM",2, 2,

Lots of action that is done well in VR including gunplay, climbing, interactions and more, good graphics and is running flawlessly for me. Polished and profesional with lots of new VR interactions I have not seen before in other games.

I own Wilson's Heart as well which is another Twisted Pixel game that is also well done but Defector has so much more action and energy with several wow moments I like this game even more.

The mechanics, shock ring, holographic scanning contact lense, those laser pistols in the dev room 😂 all of that stuff was awesome I just have 1 complaint, the guy you play as does NOT know how to run, he walks at reletively slow pace all game..

Everything just works, I had no glitching and so far (on 3rd mission)  the motion controls have been great. The shooting, talking, fighting all have been well done in VR.  The only issue I had was with the movement (I did free move) since it orients to the direction you are facing when you start (or hit both thumbsticks). If you turn at all IRL and you push up on the stick you will not be moving forward. Once I understood that,  I had zero issues. Hope they add the free movement later. Also, I can see playing through this a few times with some of the options you take have different outcomes in the game.  On top of the great gameplay, the price is nice as well. The only thing holding this back for me from the 5 star is the movement options. If that was tweaked a little, this would be a 5 star game for me all the way.  If your running a RTX 2080Ti, this runs silky smooth set on max settings on Rift S.","Jul 12, 2019 at 2:04 PM",4, 2,

Only did two missions so far and I can't wait to get back to playing after i'm done with errands.

Updated Review

I gotta knock off a star for the long loading screens just to play the missions. Another star off for the illusion of choice when it comes to selecting dialogue. There's always only 1 right answer and the game forces you to pick it most of the time. Plus, instant fail stealth missions if you get spotted and I hate that mechanic the most in any game that has it. I can easily kill the things that I'm supposed to avoid detection from, but the game won't let me.

Lastly, sometimes the game has some weird frame issues where the action slows down for a brief moment and it's really noticeable.

A 3 out of 5 is pretty much a 7/10 to me. Still a good game, just got some issues that I can't let slide. The only thing that's keeping me from playing it consistently is the loading screens that I mentioned before. The wait is just that bad.","Aug 10, 2019 at 3:03 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 13:29:09.768684,Kent,Please fix the roomscale.,In the first level you can can only move a couple feet from the center of your play space in your room. If you move further than that it pauses and blurs out and  you have to move back to the center to resume.  I couldn't even side step to the side of a airplane door for cover without it pausing. In the later levels it stops restricting this thank goodness but the joy stick locomotion is still based on the center of your room and not your location in the room. This causes you to constantly have to walk to the center of the room to properly locomote or joystick turn properly. It also causes you to clip through walls alot if your using joystick locomotion and not standing in the center of the room. I was disapointed this game didn't impliment roomscale better like so many indie games have. I think It would be better without the conversation mini games. Alot of the game is sitting so keep a chair handy. The gambling level is busted and I had to google how to get coins. That part almost made me refund the game. Game seemed a little too easy.

2022-05-28 13:29:25.645177,TerrbearSF,Fun super spy game with some flaws,"Overall it feels more like a 2016 VR game than something contemporary. I’ll be honest that after the first stage the game started to feel like a bit of a slog to get through. My teenager self would’ve loved this game a lot, but the 42yo side of me felt this game had a lot of tired spy tropes, some super awkward turning controls, and a story that felt like it just wanted to setup action set pieces just for the sake of than really tell something remotely interesting. Sure that last part gets to the point, but narratively it doesn’t hardly try. Honestly the story didn’t get good until shortly before and after the credits in that Marvel kind of way.","Jul 15, 2019 at 10:07 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 13:29:25.663129,Gasolio,This game rocks,"Only through two and a half levels, and have replayed those three times already just because I wanted to do it all again right after finishing. And there are branching options which do affect the story.  Needs a beefy pc to run at max. Graphics are if not the best close to it. Gun battles are really fun.","Aug 5, 2019 at 2:52 AM",5, 1,

I've shut down, rebooted and even unplugged the desktop as well as a myriad of combinations of the above things.  And it still won't load.","Aug 1, 2019 at 1:27 PM",1, 2,
