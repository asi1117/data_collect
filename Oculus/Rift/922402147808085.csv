2022-05-28 15:01:33.979788,Nonebetter,"Great strategy game, very fun","Play the campaign first, it was not buggy for me, and the game is way easier to learn after it.
The skirmishes are super fun, good difficulty settings and the very hard AI is actually tough to beat, especially if you are new to the game, its so fun and challenging.
This game has great VR functionality and is really immersive, I have lost who knows how many hours in there.
graphics are great, you can interact with almost anything, even bushes and barrels, the physics is fun to play with even on its own.
Play around with different combinations of units and learn their strengths and weaknesses. (dragons are super good)
want to learn/practice simple math and how turn based games work? this is the one for you.
if you like any RTS game in 2D, get this one asap and enjoy","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:11 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 15:01:37.157290,sliptie,"TLDR: Major issues, but worth the buy","17 hours in now and here's my take. Before I get into the lazy programing (for which I am NO expert, but dang have I played a LOT of games), let me say this title deserves 4 stars, borederline 5. I currently play the hard difficulty and haven't lost a pve skirmish yet (thanks to broken cpu units); though the campaign is proving more difficult (thanks to broken player units). --The hands down worst part of this game is broken units. Sometimes cpu, sometimes player. There are times when units (I've only observed the beserker, machine gunner, and sniper) will just walk the path given to them. They won't fight or agro other units, they just walk until they are ended. It's not that, for example, the beserker won't target flyers (since it doesn't target flyers), but it won't engage ANYONE, include soldiers. This basically means your current skirmish or campaign scenario is a full wash and waste of time; restart. --The next thing that is a bit frustrating is the navigation controls and the building/general placement on the board. It works ""ok"", but unless you zoom in to a very specific hex; you have a good chance of misplacing generals or not placing a building. As you slowly and gently release the trigger, so as not to upset the pinpoint trigger, the reticle barely moves; try placing the building  again, and again, and ...... well you get it. Hopefully it isn't a strategic placement of your general, because there is an extremely good chance it will end up in a different hex. --If you have played BT, you understand how fluid, seamless, and even enjoyable map navigation can be, this falls so far short. --The premise of the game is overwhelmingly enjoyable to me. It takes stragey, city building, slight RPG, RTS, and even card aspects (tho the cards statement is a bit of a stretch) and wraps it up into a well balanced game. There are under developed parts of this game, and it has a few bugs. Until a true gamer codes a similar game, done right, this is well worth the purchase.","May 26, 2018 at 11:12 PM",4, 20,

2022-05-28 15:01:40.279937,loganjamesalex,Great RTS. Great Controls. Great in VR.,"Controls on Oculus Touch are amazing. Some of them aren't explained in game like being able to lower the table so I can play sitting down, but they are so intuitive that I figured it out on my own in just a couple minutes. The combat is swell, again not explained but twisting the direction my touch controller is facing when placing a unit changing the direction they face and the path they take makes so much sense I figured it out in the first tutorial battle.

2022-05-28 15:01:40.324818,Kylther,"Great Game, but it has Issues.","I love that this game is like Civilization meets RTS at points, but the RTS part I have an issue with. The controlls are finicky and it doesn't let you determine where your troops go all the time. If it could sense how you are holding the controllers and which direction they are facing and plot a course based off that data it would save people from trying to be sneaky, only to have their troops constantly walking past the stands that help you in battle. 

Please fix or at least address this issue.","Mar 17, 2018 at 11:01 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 15:01:43.441482,Ghilly,Heroes of Might and Magic + MOBA,"I'm a bit through the third mission of the campaign and I have to say I'm impressed. Gameplay is turn-based, but combat is real time. You spawn troops into lanes to destroy enemy towers and ultimately their base. 

Suprising amount of strategic depth and fun to the combat. Combat is also fast enough so you don't feel like it's a burden to the rest of the game. 

Really like the level of depth both in combat and on the world map. Lots of relatively simple systems work together to create a well balanced and strategic game that's just deep enough to enjoy without getting bogged down each turn in too much detail. Still plenty of room for people to min/max those resource gains for optimal growth and progression each round. Graphically the game is clear and cute, lots of colour and good performance. Sound and music is nothing really special. 

My only gripes would be:
1) Menus disappear after resetting position
2) Had one crash, so it's not entirely stable
3) I don't understand why there is a loading screen going into and out of combat, The scenes are not that detailed. Should be able to flip in and out more quickly.
4) The lever to go to different rooms is a bit janky","Dec 10, 2017 at 10:26 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:01:43.457439,Slick1984,It runs fine on an i5 4690 8GB ram,"Don't let the ""recommended"" processor stop you from buying this game, if you want to buy this game. I just played my first Skyworld on an i5 4690 with 8GB of ram. It ran just fine, but some of the switching screens may have taken a little longer to load.//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The game itself takes a little getting used to. Since it's turn-based, you can take as long as you need, when playing the computer. If I were playing another person, it might get a little annoying waiting on them to complete their turn. But, if you are playing this game, you have the time. If you don't have the time (open ended), don't start a multi-player game. Activating the menus is a little wonky, but with a little patience, you will learn how and when to use them. Is the game worth the $40 price tag? Not in my opinion. Is the game worth the $20 sale price, maybe, I haven't played enough yet. From what I experienced in my first Skyworld game, it was kind of fun, but I was not thrilled (even for it being 50% off). I do like to have a wide variety of games in my VR library and this does help fill it out. Hopefully, after playing a few more games, I'll enjoy it more. It's a solid 3 stars.","Dec 18, 2017 at 7:55 AM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 15:01:43.472399,cybervex,,"The bar must be incredibly low for so many people to give this game 5 stars. I guess it is not surprising since they keep referring to it as RTS when it is turn based not RTS.  It is very basic. Clunky feeling with all the levers and having to move panels around. The game moves at a snails pace. Be careful, it's not hard to burn through the 2 hour limit on the refund.  Not worth $30 in my opinion.","Oct 23, 2017 at 12:31 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 15:01:43.487359,Siegfriedshead,Finally something turn based,"This is the one genre that's seriously lacking in VR. They nailed it. Even though I prefer turn based RPGs not turn based strategy, this one was incredbly fun and extremely smart about how they integrated the genre with VR. It's kind of more hybrid turn based because at the end of each turn where you have a battle, you throw down cards in a real time strategy part, but it's not frantic. It's still about strategy over reflexes so if you're yerning for a turn based RPG, don't miss this one. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer. I hope the developers keep adding to it for a bit longer before going for a skyworld 2 or another similar game. Just the story mode. There's also skermish and multiplayer to keep you going after you beat it.","Nov 18, 2017 at 6:31 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:01:43.503316,Zen-Lee,Entertaining! No Leaderboards?!,"Most I've been on VR game in one sitting. Very captivating simple game, with lots of advanced complexity. A few things would be improvements for me, being able to matchmake while playing campaign. I've been sitting in mutiplayer que for awhile, to no avail, which is not fun in VR. If I could skirmish or campaign while in Que that would be great.

Magic spells are way to expensive for their effect; it seems me , except maybe poison. I've beat the normal computer easily, but cannot beat the hard computers, which either are cheating or have the perfect build order.

Also defense needs a buff. If I have a general next to a my homebase/castle then enemy should have to clear it before attacking the tower/base. 

Co-op skirmish vs A.I. might be fun. A scoreboard or leaderboard or rank- 

Played my first mutiplayer match, and was winning. Seems whoevers General dies first, pretty much is going to lose. Toward the end of my match received the error, ' connection lost' - therefore, I didn't secure the victory.

If anyone can beat me in multiplayer I'll send you a lil bitcoin!","Oct 19, 2017 at 11:47 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:01:46.611005,Eulenauge66,Sweet to look at,"Great, how quick good VR games come out these months! Arktika.1, Lone Echo, From Other Suns - and this, Skyworld. If you´re used to strategy games, you will quickly get the hang of it. If not - don´t be irritated by the first half hour of the tutorial. The basic mechanisms are quickly understood.

While the main world is round- based and you have time to build your economy and move your generals (your armies), the battles are some kind of animated card game. I think I need to play more of the latter to judge it. Right now, as a veteran of Starcraft, Age of Empires, but also Heroes of Might & Magic, it appears too simple. You can´t do much than throw your cards into the field. It is not Real Time Strategy, as the trailer might look like.

Nevertheless, it all seems complex enough to be motivating for a longer time.

UPDATE: I have played now through only the 2nd map of the campaign. To be honest, I don´t think I will go back often. I think VR is wonderful for strategy games, but this one is - for my taste and experience - just too simple. Maybe they should have focused on just one aspect of the game. Real time battle or round- based (I would have preferred the latter).","Oct 21, 2017 at 3:48 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:01:46.625964,Duncan_Disorderly,"It's not great, but it is good","Gameplay is a standard strategy type game and uses a card based system. Although, you don't exactly feel like you're using cards during battle. It's more like you select what's available to fight and make sure you have enough mana cost. And, just like all these games, it's turn based. You build, protect, acquire resources, tweak your finances to their best potential without losing workers. As well, you upgrade a variety of things. The 'table/gameboard' is round and you use your hands to spin it around to get to another part of the map. This was a bit of a pain to use, especially when your table keeps moving when you get to your desired area. It did this about half the time. The menu is accessed by bringing up the selections (4 in total) in the form of 4 items and grabbing the item to bring up the menu you want. They're positioned just above your wrist and no matter which wrist you use, you need to navigate without triggering the wrong one, which was a bit of a pain. Gameplay was fun, but nothing spectacular, since it's a genre most gamers are familiar with. The graphics aren't bad, which does make up for any shortcomings. Also, it's important to note that if you're sat down and the game spawns the table too high, simply reach up and pull the table down. It should lower it significantly, so you can play the game without standing. Actually, the game would be much better if you could reduce the size as well. Unfortunately, all you can do is move the table up, down, towards and away from you. You can reset orientation in the game menu where you save.","Oct 22, 2017 at 6:35 AM",4, 8,

Sorry, but one star from me as I've lost interest in it now that it's broken. I'm out of pocket because the dev's have rushed something out without proper testing(was it because Brass Tactics was due around now?)

My Initial Thoughts:
As a massive fan of Arizona Sunshine, one of my most played VR titles I had high hopes for this game. Those hopes were met. Skyworld is a game of 2 halves. The game starts as a turn-based resource management and creation section played on a cool diorama, these resources are then used to create and upgrade cards which serve as your main army for the RTS section of the game which plays out in the style of a Clash Royale mobile game. A cross between RTS and Tower Defense. I must confess I have never been a fan of this style of game but in VR it works brilliantly and is a sight to behold.
