2022-05-28 16:56:38.148687,TheLonelyDeveloper,Very bad. Not worth the download.,"No disrespect to the war veterans. I am sure it was a horrible experience. But this VR ""experience"" is very bad. Not worth the download or the space it takes up on your PC or Quest. Graphics are bad, the interior of the plane is too dark and the exterior (which you can see as you clip through the plane) is a joke. Looks like its made by somebody with very poor design skills. As a game developer myself, I am horrified. I don't know how BBC could let anyone put their name on this. The rating is only high because of the emotions the original audio transmits. All respect to the war veterans, but this is an insult to those people. Don't waste your time experiencing this.",22 days ago,1, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:38.164644,TheEarquake,Hauntingly affecting and very right too,"What a truly wonderful thing to have done.  I have known of the original recording for many years, it calls out through history as an act of bravery recorded.   Only now though do you have the true sense of the cramped conditions and helplessness of the crew on the persitent mission where calm is all you can offer yourself when luck will have it's way with you.

It would have been nice to see some other positions within the bomber like tail and mid-gunner positions but however that's as much a statement of the success of this experience, I just want to see more and more of it.

A wonderful work to do honour to all of the men involved.  Well done and indeed thank you.",Apr 2 at 6:55 AM,5, 5,

2022-05-28 16:56:57.134905,kihew,This experience stays with you.,"I love flying and aviation, and I love WWII allied bombers. So just the menu experience of sitting next to a Lancaster and feel it's huge size in VR while parked on a war field on a late afternoon was impressive. 
Then, the actual experience begins with that long, heavy takeoff, it got me there. The thundering rumble of those 4 engines, the flames coming out of their exhaust, all felt real. 
Then how dynamic and expressive the crew models are as you hear their voices speak and - yup - sing. I just felt the experience was too short, I might even have endured the whole 8 hour long flight although I might be in minority here. But longer scenes would be most welcome.
Above all, it's an eye opening experience for the sacrifices of so many young men not that long ago, and the respect they deserve for their courage. You can feel their vulnerability in this experience. And they would do this time and time again. The majority didn't return home. I hope their sacrifice is not forgotten.

My great uncle once did exactly what that commentator did. He was a deskbound administrator at an RAF aerodrome and begged a crew to take him on a mission one night.  So they did, and afterwards he vowed never to do it again! The Lancaster he was on returned with a gaping hole in the side of the fuselage.

I applaud the devs for making this, it's both beautiful and horrific, the visuals and the reality. 
I've seen many a war film and all are upsetting, as they should be, I think this just enhanced my thoughts on how much effort went in to wasting so many precious lives and the everyday horrors that could befall people on both sides. 
Meanwhile the commentary from the host and crew is so very British in the face of such terror.

So, this is basically something that could easily have been made into a short film at a museum (though I think someone out there running a museum for old planes has stumbled across this and had the idea), but without you having to pay entrance fees to experience.

It seems almost faked with how nonchalantly the entire crew is about the situation. Usually when you hear of bombing runs over high profile targets, everyone's super tensed up with their planes being hit by Flakk from all over. Here it's just that posh british accent going ""gee, is that a Jerry fighter? Oh gosh, it is. Gunner, take care of it, would you? I'll prepare the tea"". But it's actual recordings of the flight crew interactions...

Would definitely recommend if you're interested in learning about what a bombing crew had to deal with during bombing runs. Would definitely not recommend if you don't like watching documentaries.","Aug 29, 2019 at 11:13 PM",4, 10,

I can't even say what made me cry the most. The calmness of the bomber crew in the face of death on the grace of a coin flip, being a born Berliner and seeing your city burn to ashes, thinking about the state of the world back then and today, knowing this really happened or the sheer loss of life that happened, leaving back no winners, just less losers.

Events like this can't ever happen again in Europe and should cease to happen all over the world. I hate to admit, that the ideology on which something like this grew in Germany and all over the world, did not vanish from this planet. Even some few of the comments on this master piece carry equally nationalistic views.

After years of public school I've written countless reports about WWII. I've gone to musiums, wrote papers, heck I even have a copy of Band of Brothers on my bookshelf.
This story was good knowing that these were recordings so it isn't like you could or would want to change what really happened. It's a shame that there was 0 interaction with it but the simple scenes let you focus on the recordings.
You're in a small cabin, engines on both sides going none stop, and just taking a moment to reflect yourself on to these men, thinking that that could be your final resting place while the ground below you is on fire is unsettling.

For what it was worth I think it makes for a nice education tool and a great way to feel the perspective of who had to lived through this.

I hope the developers are proud of what they have accomplished. In a way I could relate to the navigator, in the back trying to focus while a thin sheet of metal seperates you from hell on Earth. It's the little things that give us the most comfort.","Aug 16, 2019 at 5:11 AM",5, 1,

I will show this to my children before the visit her their great nana next week  and I dont think they will look at her in the same light again!

What some cannot imagine is that these attacks had about 95% collateral damage and we now have been first person witnesses of this heroic strategy. These attacks killed 600.000 children, women, old men while most soldiers were at the front, or already dead at this point of the war. Many more were badly injured and millions became homeless refugees. Imagine what ""Bombed out"" means - These attacks had even more civilian casualties than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki together. Not only this, but dying was much more painful for the children in fire and below broken buildings compared to getting obliterated by an atomic bomb.

BBC I want you to show the other side too, maybe as second menu selection: Sirens. A woman without her husband (who was indoctrinated as patriot from childhood and then taken by the regime as cannon fodder), fleeing through burning streets. Trying to reach the nearest bunker. Just to die shortly before reaching it, buried by rocks, while seeing her children surrounded by flames that come closer and closer. Only my grandmother made it out of this night.

While I understand it's based off of a real life event it all honestly seemed pretty uneventful aside from the brief fighter encounter.  What was there could be improved by adding more detail to the aircraft and crew behavior and allowing the user to jump to the different aircraft positions during each sequence would be a nice addition.

As someone listening just to a recording of a bombing raid I could see it being interesting enough, but to actually sit inside that cramped machine is truly something else and the greatest example of what VR can do. You really do feel lost in the moment and you can get a sense for just how it must have felt being cooped up in the dark in a small and barebones aircraft, being hunted down and rattled by the flak exploding around you. This gives a whole new appreciation of what it took to serve in the war and what kind of experience soldiers on all sides had to deal with. It’s also wonderful to see the comradeship of the crew and really feel it as you fly alongside them.

Two generations that weren't even involved in the war, keep on getting their brains washed with this one sided reporting. It was a massacre and the same mistakes are made now, with patriotic drivel driving nations against each other. Yet this mini segment of WW2 fails to mention anything unrelated to the deads of  the British alone. One can really only understand this point if one has seen the decade long programming put out by the BBC.

She told me stories of how they would hide under/behind anything they could - they most feared the fighters, who by this time had little enemy aircraft to shoot at, and would dive down shooting at anything that moved. Seeing my grandma today, a very old frail lady, it is difficult to imagine she was literally dodging bullets aged 7 - bullets my English grandad was busy loading into Spitfires for the RAF!
Having moved near a small town by Frankfurt - she was to meet my Grandad, some few years after wars end - they still live in that small town.
My grandads best friend - who also still lives opposite them - has a big flower nursery - and in their cellar are all the graffiti drawings and such they would scrawl on there when they were 7-14 years of age in those dark days.

Sure it would be possible to pick bits of it apart, but as an experience for everyone rather than especially for the rivet counters it really is superb, you might even say moving.  For those who question the German casualties quoted at the end I suggest you do some research and look up the details about the Berlin raid of the 3-4 Sept 1943, a total of 422 Germans were killed during the raid.  The raid, 316 bombers and 4 Mosquitoes, preceeded (not by much) the bomber campaign proper.

In some ways, it's quite an atmospheric experience. And coming along for a ride seems like a good way to experience historical events.

Vantage points are strange. You wind up sitting very close to the crewman, in some cases, maybe you even intersect them. VR makers should be respectful enough to avoid unexpected ""intimacy"" in VR. This is a crucial flaw that should be learned from.","Oct 7, 2018 at 7:45 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 16:58:54.220743,Valver,A powerful way to learn about history,Great job BBC!  I found it an immersive and fascinating look into the flight of a Lancaster bomber.  It made me think of all the pilots who went out and fought for their countries - many of whom did not return.  As a 40 something adult I cant really comprehend what they went through - but this begins to show it in ways regular film cannot.  I will show this to my kids.  I wish I couldve shared this with my Grandfather.  The audio from the time is amazing.  Graphically pretty simplistic in places - but I dont think that matters at all.

2022-05-28 16:58:54.237697,Doc_GG,Breathtaking,"What a piece this is. Short, but oh so sweet. I've had many a VR experience, but truth be told, this one really did something special for me. Many people talk of VR experiences being so real they thought they were there. After playing so many titles, it is tough for me to get that experience anymore. I've rarely achieved the immersion this game gave to me. I think this came from the fact that the audio truly happened. This was the real broadcast from my understanding. What sent shivers down my spine was that these men truly lived this, and there was I, sat right next to them. Truly breathtaking. The bravery of these men was unparalled. Their voices don't shake, they hardly talk out of turn, and all with death just mere feet from them. You have to experience it to know what I'm saying. It's free. If nothing else, download it to know what these men went through. Well done BBC. My thanks.","Oct 21, 2018 at 1:03 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:58:57.341396,Fluke,Interesting (ish) but short.,"Can't really complain considering it's a freebie, and if you're into WWII history, you can probably add another star to the rating. There are a couple of things that threw me out of the experience though.

First off was that after recentering at the start, some of the positions it puts you in feel slightly off. At the start taking off, your head feels slightly too far back, and it's easy to clip through the geometry if you turn around.

In the cockpit (and behind the bomber as well), it felt like you should have been maybe 6 inches to a foot higher just to get a better view.

In the section looking back at the rear gunner, my head (and I've run through it twice now) was definitely too far back and off center, and was clipping through the geometry for the dome.

At one point, the navigator moved his hand and his pencil floated in mid air for a couple of seconds before reattaching to his hand.

There is noticably no detail on the cockpit instruments.

If you have a Buttkicker or a Subpac (or equivalent), crank it up - it certianly adds to the immersion with this.","Oct 5, 2018 at 9:59 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:58:57.358351,Tarbal,Very well done,"You really feel like you are in the raid, well done BBC.

The radio show is also very good. he says the raid was 38 years ago at that point so its a 1981 radio show. The detail in the room was nice, the needle arm slowly working its way across the record. Only let down by the clock not moving (maybe its broken ... lol)
