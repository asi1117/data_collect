answer to devs ! you respond agressivly to 2 on 2 not adventageous commentary. i give my opinion  and now in my opinion its clear that oculus should take mesure on you i suggere to ban your material from the store bye bye sy co path......","Mar 30, 2021 at 5:21 AM",1, 0,"No 3D, no color, no good graphics, no atmosphere, no story. Not sure what you experienced? Maybe you viewed via a poor Quest Link? This was experienced by top VR industry judges and was awarded a 2nd place international award for best of VR show/series for a reason that can't possibly include no nothing. This first episode is only 12 minutes of the story as well. The story is just getting started. But, you didn't even stay very long anyway. So, no story?? First, we get a TROLL who sent us hate mail says its worse than a high school project because he's mad that we had an issue at first with the codec, and didn't fix it over night. Now everyone who likes are all stupid. What a world we all live in??

_  

OK, all that likes this are stupid, and it should be taken down so they, and for that matter no one else can enjoy it because you have an opinion. And we can't respond if it contradicts with your opinion. Or, we have a suggestion that maybe you have a bad Quest Link? Because, you may not like it, but there certainly is color, gobs of 3D, much broad environments (atmospheres), and certainly a developing story.

_      

Apparently then some people like this experience, some a lot, and some not so much. But, the not so much ones seem so angry about it for some reason??"

Response to dev's note below - THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.  In fact the opposite is true.  Wow, these guys are something else!  A bit unhinged.  Good grief.

ADD-ON  Well, I guess if you can lie here in the public forum you can lie in a report to Oculus.  Knock yourself out.  Boy, you sure know how to win your customers over, don't you?  Grin!  But you better have complete emails with headers and footers and my IP imbedded that you can forward them.  If you don't, you'll be exposed as the liars you are.    
-----------------------------------------

Now works without the codec.

Still not particularly impressed however.  Think early 70s sci-fi cheese meets up with contemporary VR technology.  Pretty blah.  It feels more like a high school project than a professional, polished VR endeavour.","Dec 14, 2020 at 3:06 AM",1, 2,"-TROLL- This user sent us profane email cursing and shouting. We will not go back and forth with a Troller. Oculus does not currently have a policy for Trolling due to limited occurrence. However, after reporting this very nasty troller they are considering the policy."

It feels a bit like being inside a Wing Commander cutscene, updated for modern times.

2022-05-28 20:36:11.841828,BL4YDON23,Was ok.,"I thought it was ok.

Yourll need to install HEVC on google play if you dont have it at 99ct or 79p Its not free anymore.

But its worth that so dont worry about paying for that.

I'll hang on and see what ep 2 does.

Thannks","Oct 28, 2020 at 8:56 PM",3, 1,The app is now updated and the HEVC issue is resolved. Anyone can now install the app without the need for the HEVC codec. We appreciate your patience as we addressed this issue. Thank you!!
2022-05-28 20:36:11.856788,JulianJm,Cool Scifi 360 Video,Its a great scifi story that has huge space scenes! I wish there were more episodes. Definitely worth the money though.,"Oct 27, 2020 at 9:43 AM",5, 2,
