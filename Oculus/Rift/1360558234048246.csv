2022-05-28 19:26:36.950657,Typhon1,Best free game out there,Very demanding not only for your body but your mind as well. Makes out workout not feel like a workout and makes it's fun and challenging at the same time. It is very easy to go and have fun but hard to master and get all achievments.,"Aug 24, 2020 at 2:44 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 19:26:36.981574,TuckerDogg57,I love it,"I really really love it but can you add a fee range mode to pratice for, its a very amazing game.","Feb 16, 2020 at 5:06 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:26:36.996534,VibrationsOfDoom,One of my go to games...,"VERY exhausting, when I need exercise and don't feel like getting completely out of breath from playing one of the boxing games, I go to this. Challenging as hell, now you know what REAL quarterbacks have to face. Targets pop up, throw the football through them! Really quite simple, but hitting those bullseyes INSIDE the targets; ah, that's the REAL challenge... Side stepping the rushing attackers is nice too, when you do it right, it's a nice feeling... Still, since the latest update, I CANNOT get sound to come through the Rift headset AT ALL... Dunno why this is, but I have to go to my monitor's speakers to get any sound at all... Fix please?","Mar 18, 2019 at 10:24 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:26:37.011494,Areyes86,great game!,This is definitely worth the download. We have a bit of a competition going on here and it is quite addictive! We are hovering scores right around the 200K mark! cant see how anyone can hit the 300K...if you want a challenge give it a shot. you'll have a worn out arm in no time!,"Nov 25, 2018 at 5:42 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:26:40.134142,Nameless4Now,Love It!,Very Fun and challenging!  It's a quick game to try and beat your high score by throwing the ball through targets and dodge the rushing opposing team members before time runs out!  I keep returning to this game because of its appeal.  I like that they incorporated Payton Manning Too!,"Nov 25, 2018 at 12:45 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:26:40.149102,Pandoomic,Controllers don't display in-game,I can see and use my controllers in any other app than this one. They just never show up.,"Oct 11, 2018 at 1:41 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:26:40.164063,PopeFamine,Almost broke my TV and Pinky finger.,"As the title reads, I almost broke my tv and pinky finger playing this. I had a couple drinks and Peyton Manning kept talking about how dehydrated I was getting and my vision was getting blurry. I dodged the oncoming blitz and threw a perfect deep pass into the inzone, but my follow through did not hit a helmut... I hit my tv and almost woke up my sleeping household. For a Gatoraid ad, I was completely immersed and worth playing again.","Mar 20, 2018 at 1:36 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:26:40.179022,HeadlessRoland,One of the best quick games on Rift,"I'm really surprised! This may be an ad, but it is also one of the most fun and addictive games on the Rift. The mechanics are not perfect, but if you stick with it a few rounds and figure out how to adjust your grip and control the release it actually starts to feel quite good. I know my shoulder is now every bit as hosed as it is after a long afternoon of throwing a real football (and that's a good thing).

Fun fun fun!","Mar 11, 2018 at 6:58 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:26:40.193982,FastLawyer,"VR advertising, how it should be done","This is probably the best advertisement VR game out there.  First of all, the ad in VR is well presented.  Nice graphics, information is straightforward and informative.  Second, the tutorial is easy to follow.  And lastly, the game itself is pretty fun.  It's not the best VR QB game (it's still VR Sports Challenge or even 2MD VR), but it's up there.  Plus it's free.  As far as the advertisement, you can pretty much not see it again after the required first viewing.  You can play the game / challenge directly after that.

So nice job, Gatorade.  Any other companies that want to step up to the plate and offer free VR games, make sure you follow this example.  A fun, simple game that is polished.  Your ad is not intrusive, but well done and enjoyable.  You offer something good, for our time in listening to your product pitch.  This is how you do it.  Rating 5/5: It's free and it's high quality, even if it's short, there's a lot of replay value for better personal scores (no global leaderboards)","Mar 2, 2018 at 9:45 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:26:43.292694,Worcester_Jim,Great free game - well done Gatorade,"Free game where you throw american footballs through moving hoops whilst dodging Blitzers. A nice easy to learn active game, that is fun. The advertising is seamless and naturally part of the game, being educational too. I am impressed by the slickness of this free game and hence more positively predisposed to Gatorade. Hence I am much more likely to buy Gatorade as a result. Win/win.","Mar 3, 2018 at 2:23 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:26:43.307654,Forbidden76,Amazing little game!,Thank you Gatorade for putting this together. Other companies should take note for some fun advertising that works! I will keep coming back to this game for sure. Thanks for letting us lefties play! It really feels like I am hurling a football and dodging the linebacker is great fun! Runs great on a i5-7500 16gb 1050ti 4gb!,"Mar 3, 2018 at 9:29 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:26:43.321616,kgian76,One of the best promo VR apps,"Wow, really well done VR promo experience. Great presentation, great controls, great gameplay. Short and to the point, it has got sleek control scheme, a brief beautifully presented informative section and addictive gameplay. Well done!","Mar 2, 2018 at 4:57 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 19:26:46.456233,nightcat.mau,Fun!,"Throwing passes into targets, geting blitzed, it was all good. A clever ad that makes me want Gatorade? Yep, but a nice way to throw the ball around. And try to avoid getting hit.","Mar 15, 2018 at 7:54 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:26:46.520062,lonewolf13313,Super inconsistent.,"You can throw the same way every time, sometimes it will go straight, other times the ball is going to drop at your feet, and other times it going to shoot straight left or right.  There is no pattern to how the ball is going to react.","Mar 4, 2018 at 3:06 AM",1, 0,
