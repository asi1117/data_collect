2022-05-28 15:20:40.425457,David Wagner ITTR,I wanted it to be great.,"To me, the controls make it uncomfortable, no matter what method I choose. It’s infuriatingly frustrating when it should be so simple; why are we swinging our arms like we’re a robot strolling on the moon? I’m not a fan of the simple, somewhat clunky, pointer teleportation method in this game, and I usually prefer teleportation in most games; teleportation in Red Matter being my favorite .. it’s the most gorgeous teleportation you’ll ever see, it brings up a pretty illuminated grid when activated. For this one, using the joysticks to move forward is the best option for me, but it’s often slow going. Update: I just realized tonight you can run by holding the trigger, but going down stairs is snail paced so that’s a good time to use the teleportation. Shooting is satisfying, but gripping items or the steering wheel is annoying; I would prefer to not have the stick-grip, where my hands are glued to an item until I click off of it. Update: I added a star because you can toggle the grip option, though not for the steering wheel or guns it seems, those are stick-grip. Facial animations are pretty impressive in VR. Back in the day, I always found this game to be overly difficult, but watching the people’s faces really is the key to a successful interview.",Jan 17 at 8:30 PM,3, 7,

2022-05-28 15:20:40.454380,ianovitch,Not Bad,"This game was not as good as I thought it would be. I was a little disapointed when I played the game. With that being said This game has a lot of pros. For example, the gun fights are fun with destruction physics and easy reload. There are also a lot of fist fights which couldn't be better considering this game isn't made around fist fights. There are quite a few challlenging crime scenes and if you aren't good at puzzles and exploration I would definetly recommend a guide.",Jul 8 at 10:56 AM,4, 9,
2022-05-28 15:20:40.469339,ACE21813,"So far so good, will update.","Graphics are so dated on PC, but in VR, they hold up quite well! The world looks great and the music adds a great atmosphere with it. The driving is good, not great, but it is a VR game and I'm assuming it doesn't support a racing wheel and so for what it is, it's really better than expected. The shooting was fun as well which is always a plus. I definitely look forward to playing more!","Apr 12, 2021 at 6:27 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 15:20:40.483302,Bexag,Cool Concept. TERRIBLE Execution.,"I've played the original game maybe about 3 or 4 times. I always come back to it after maybe a year or two. Love the game, and I wish they'd make a sequel. That being said, THIS is bad. After setting up a Rockstar account after 15 min (mind you, I was eager to just hop in and play), I boot it up and everything was sloppy and jank. The tutorial was a mess, the movement options make a simple couple of steps in a straight line feel like operating heavy machinery unless you just teleport everywhere (which I'm not a fan of). The size ratio for everything was off. Theres these fight scenes you do every now and again, and they give you the ablity to block, but if you just stand there in a ""Y"" pose, they can't hurt you, you can just block forever. Your in game model is just hilarious. It made me sick to play, and I rarely get motion sick in VR. The only part of the game I really liked was the interrogation bits. Which take about as long as it took me to get a Rockstar account.","Oct 14, 2020 at 6:45 AM",2, 20,
2022-05-28 15:20:43.602958,PassTheNutella,Awful just awful,First of all it requires you to download the rockstar social club which makes no sense and then you have these really terrible controls that are extremely uncomfortable and it only has 2 hours of playtime for 30 dollars.

2022-05-28 15:20:43.618915,RandomlyGenerated,Amazing ...but Rough Around the Edges,"I started playing this game when it came out, and loved it here I am a few years later and I still do. This is not to say however that it has it doesn't have its fair shared of problems. For one the controls and functions are meh, but then again it is a game from 2011, and there is a serious lack of content, but we are lucky we even got this game at all. Eventhough there might not be any patrol missions or real story it still remains one of my personal favorite vr games and is well worth the price. And for people who are fans of the original game consider this the sequal we never got. One thing that must be said is that maybe just maybe had the vr comunity been less harsh on this game, and realized its worth, there might have been a sequal. So that is why I think this game is worth the asking price.","Jun 9, 2020 at 6:04 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:20:43.632878,ericbazinga,"Rough around the edges, but still fun","I'm a big fan of the original LA Noire, and decided to give this port a try. I've been enjoying it so far, though I do have some issues I'd like to list here. 

1. When you start the game for the first time, you have to download the Rockstar Launcher and sign up for Rockstar Social Club, which is just unnecessary. Sure, setup is somewhat quick and painless (it was for me), but still, what's the point?

2. When you open the game, a popup comes up asking if you want to open the Rockstar Launcher. Which you can't dismiss unless you take off the headset (opening up the virtual desktop will crash Oculus), defeating the point of it being accessible within the Oculus library in-headset. 

3. When I first booted up the game, Cole was disproportionate to everything else, I basically had giant Hulk hands. Dunno why that happened, but restarting the game fixed it. When in doubt, turn it off and on again!

4. The movement in this game is rather unorthodox. Most VR games use either teleport or the thumbstick. This game has you toggle a reticule by tapping X or A twice, then pointing at what you want, then pressing X or A again to select. This method is... okay, but I still would've greatly appreaciated a standard thumbstick since I'm not easily prone to motion sickness and can handle thumbstick modement fine. Also, when selecting I kept finding myself using the trigger instead of X/A. A better way to map this would be X/A once to turn the reticle on (with optional setting so the reticle is always on), then trigger to select.  

5. Or you can try arm swinging, where you swing your arms in place to move. It's dreadfully slow to use, just don't. I appreciate the effort but it just doesn't work.
To be honest I just wish I could alter this game to have a more standard VR control scheme.

Of course, despite these issues, it's still LA Noire and still plenty of fun to play (once you get used to the controls). Recommended if you enjoy the original, but be aware of the above issues.","Mar 18, 2020 at 8:03 PM",3, 14,

2022-05-28 15:20:43.661800,ThornyBlades,"Amazing, want more","its one of my BEST vr experiences, i wish there were more levels, definently completable in maybe a few hours, but to be honest, i love how vigilant you have to be, the faces, the evidence, and then the car chases, big like, the combat is good, the pistol had unlimited ammo but the other guns have limited ammo, the fist combat could be better, but it is still pretty good, just wish the opponents didnt go down so easily, and that they put up a good strong fight, then again, they cant make all your time go into boxing in a police game, the detective work though, im not the best at it, but i still like it. Mainly because of the fact i got stumped multiple times. With comfort mode off, close phelps goes slow down stairs, so i'd reccomend teleporting down them, but over all, its 5/5","Mar 23, 2020 at 6:31 AM",5, 3,

TLTW (too long to write-up) at the moment);
1. Rockstar Social Club is a pain in the butt
2. We shouldn't rate this whole game on that silly mishap (social club being a pain)
3. This game's graphics are pretty much that of the old game
4. The facial animations are amazing as they were in the original game
5. Interaction with objects is brilliant
6. Interacting with cars is awesome, it's like a car sim of the 1940's as well as a thriller Crime Investigation Game.
7. Narrative/Story Telling is awesome
8. various methods to move around are brilliant, incorporating the same system CREED uses, as well as a teleport-style option, and a micro-move option
9. I am running an R9 295x2 (non CF) - so essentially an R9 290x and it runs perfectly, no stutters or anything.
10. I can't wait to play more!

FYI I am running the following specs (and the game runs perfectly);
i7 3770k - 4.7Ghz
16GB DDR3 - 1600Mhz
SSD x 256GB (this is the drive the game is on)
GPU: R9 295x2 (4GB VRAM per-GPU, 2x 290x GPU's on one card) - not overclocked

I'll post a better review at a later date, right now I gotta go.

Thank you Developers for making this game - I appreciate it.","Feb 4, 2019 at 5:01 AM",5, 16,

I can't give anything above 1 star if the app itself doesn't work.

Get past that, and make sure you select sign in automatically or you'll be ripping your headset off to go through that again every time you restart it, and you will restart it, because it crashes A LOT.

Nice intro desk bit. Then on to the tutorial. Which is like totally black. You can't see anything. I'm running a GTX1080Ti, with the latest drivers and there's nothing visible in my headset except the skybox above me. I somehow get through this tutorial like a blind man. Forget the arm swing locomotion, you have to do highlight object or it's impossible.

Then I get onto the first actual case. It's totally black too. So I try setting all the graphics settings to min / off. Restart the game. Try the first case. Wow I can see... then it crashes and locks up before I can even open the car door. After an hour of wasting my time just trying to get the game to even work I give up.

I try to submit a ticket to rockstart support, but even that system is broken because ""Something bad happened"" apparently and I can't submit the support ticket.

To Oculus. 
JUST REMOVE THIS FROM THE STORE IN THE MEANTIME. It lets everything down. It doesn't conform to the seemless operation of the oculus experience.

EDIT: For those interested, I have found the solution in the meantime:

I've raised the rating to 2 stars, as I was able to play for a bit, and it's not a terrible game now that it actually works.  There are still some issues with polish (text getting cut off/obscured by in-game elements, no initial indication that you should click the stick to confirm positioning, etc.) but it's actually fun once you get into it.

2022-05-28 15:20:56.262099,rosssmiller,This game is simply not functional,"This game is extraordinarily broken, largely because of Rockstar's mandatory check-in with their own Social Club. Every time I launch the game, it attempts to log-in, but just hangs indefinitely. The only way I can get it to work is by taking off my headset while it sits on the load screen, signing off Rockstar, signing back in (by repeating their awful capcha system multiple times), and then putting the headset back on.

Even after jumping through hoops just to get the game going, its re-orientation feature is broken, forcing me to face a part of my room which gives me less lateral movement. THEN, after the initial intro segment at the desk, the game refuses to load textures! It's just a black world with pop-up text telling me how to interact with things that I can't see.

Maybe it's possible to fix this issue through graphics setting adjustments, but seeing as those require a reboot to check on, and I have to go through such a ridiculous round-about method to even launch the game, I'm not going to bother with it. I'm hoping Oculus will just give me my money back.

I buy and play quite a few games on the Oculus, and this is the first time I've ever requested a refund. Even though I bought it on sale for $20, I feel completely ripped off.","Jul 16, 2018 at 2:59 AM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 15:20:56.292019,PoolfanVr,Flawed but worthwhile experience,"I bought this game on sale at half price and at that price I'd give it 4 stars.  I've not played the standard version of this game but I have played all of the GTA games and I suspect Rockstar are using this as a VR testing ground for GTA.

The minute I was stood on an authentic 1940s LA street and walk freely or drive around LA I was hooked - the environment does not have the variety and detail as GTA but it is good nontheless and in VR it looks amazing.

So now the bad - the actual game is average.  The process of moving is - double click and you see a ghost version of yourself move forward and then you arrive at the target - not great for immersion.  I used the option of swinging your arms to walk - takes ages but at least it feels realistic.

The game switches off to tell you to take a seated position when you are driving  or interviewing - breaks the immersion. There must be a better way.

The actual game play is poor - the fights are ridiculously easy - the shoot outs are awkward and the interaction with your notepad takes a bit of getting used to. Nothing is intuitive.

But I have to recommend the game.  A VR version of a Rockstar city with free movement- thats' makes it worth the price I paid alone.  Cannot wait for GTA VR","Jul 7, 2018 at 6:23 PM",4, 4,

I don't know what some of these vr game developers are smoking but there is some kind of crazy paranoia about making people vr sick. So they presnt you with a very disjointted & depressing loco options to start with....... luckily hidden away in the options we now have the elusive smooth loco. I hope they add this for the steam users also because its imediately a million times better. So the main problem is really what seem like buggy controls. I'm pressing A...i'm still pressing A...its telling me to press A but nothing & then eventually something. Another issue is dark areas look strange, i'm guessing this is because they ported it over from the steam version, i think the gamme needs to be lower to reduce the posterizing .

2022-05-28 15:20:59.442592,Veraxus,Impressive VR experience with caveats,"First off, the way natural VR interactions and locomotion have been integrated into this game is a new benchmark for others. LA Noire was not originally developed for VR, so I cannot understate the amount of work that must have gone into making these experiences as top notch as they are. Multiple locomotion options, real evironment interaction, and a very effective combination of driving and standing that I thought we'd never see in VR.

That said, this is NOT the full LA Noire game. It's not even an abridged version of it. It's literally 6 cases that were extracted from the original and presented as stand-alone vignettes without any context. Given how great the original game's Chinatown-esque story was, this is a huge bummer. But you know what, the game is cheap and the VR implementation is GREAT. Just be aware of that going in.

Second, the game forces you to create a ""Rockstar Social"" account before you can play. This means taking off your headset and going through a whole account creation rigamarole (including a VERY annoying image captcha) before you can play. This is absolutely unacceptable for any VR game. Period. No exceptions. This should not be tolerated in Oculus Home submissions, in my opinion.

Finally, the game does not have any graphics settings that I can find. There are options for interaction styles, locomotion, etc (which I strongly suggest you customize) but there's no way to fix the visual LOE pop-in, which is especially noticeable in the lighting during nighttime cases. There are also times when certain actions (like climbing a pipe) are not terribly obvious... but that's a problem with the slightly inadequate tutorial. Once I figured it out, it was fine.

At the end of the day, this a really, really good collection of VR experiences. Were it the full game, I'd have happily paid three times the asking price given the quality level. The game runs smooth as butter on my machine (1080 + Intel i7) and the VR integration is absolutely top-notch.","Apr 1, 2018 at 3:16 AM",3, 19,

2022-05-28 15:20:59.473510,DickDastardly,Terrible first impression,"After jumping through all the hoops to sign into Rockstar Social club, the game finally launches but my headset just displays black, as does the mirror window. I then hear a burst of music and what sounds lke the clicking of an old film projector coming from my desktop speakers (not from the Rift) and that's it - no game. Have closed the window and reran it several times, and tried signing in and out of Social Club (which for some reason always seems to demand admin privileges when launching (a pop-up which doesn't appear in the headset either).


Can't believe Rockstar did so little testing on this or that Oculus let such dross onto their store - the submission should have instantly failed at the point audio wasn't routed to the Rift automatically (nevermind other small details like failing to draw anything in the headset).

Here with my i7-8700k and my GTX 1080 ti works like a charm. 

Well done Rockstar ! :)","Apr 1, 2018 at 8:30 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:21:02.612115,Slin,Buggy,"Update: I tried again a few days later to finish that mission the game would get me stuck at and this time it accepted that I was looking at the guns chamber and let me go on. There is no story connecting the cases which is a bit sad, but the gameplay works and the graphics are amazing, the movement a bit messy at times but being able to drive around in this big detailed city kinda makes up for it. Most issues from my initial review still hold true, but it's still some of the closest we'll probably get to AAA open world VR game.

Initial review: So I found the gun in Upon Reflections and opened it's chamber and the game doesn't react to the two fired shots at all after looking at it from all directions and pointing the light at it from everywhere. As a result I can't make any more progress.

Other than that high quality shadows break inside the car, SSAO is causing ugly rings outside the center of the vision, subtitles are ugly but can be disabled, voices sound a bit unnatural (with reverb but somewhat directional or something) and social club keeps asking for admin permissions when starting the game and also keeps asking me to solve a cloudsaves conflict over and over.

The actual game so far looks great, has good performance and plays well and I'd love to give a better rating if I could actually progress.","Apr 2, 2018 at 9:48 AM",4, 8,

2022-05-28 15:21:02.642035,SetsukiFR,A joke,"I originally intended to give this game a 3. While the port is lazy, ugly (forced lowest settings, higher settings create numerous visual glitches, all the dark scenes have atrocious color banding), half done, the interactions and immersion gave this game redemption.
But now I've played the last level of the game.

I hope you've played L.A. Noire before buying this one, because that mission was the cumulation of everything BAD in this game. In terms of interactivity, story, storytelling, it's a disaster.

This is too ugly to be a eye candy game, not fun enough to be a distracting game, the story was removed, and from a technical stand point, it's bad.","Apr 21, 2018 at 7:22 PM",1, 10,

2022-05-28 15:21:05.764683,Crommi,"It's a mess, refund and wait for patches","Multiple issues and annoyances, starting from the fact that game requires you to get out of VR to sign-up for Rockstar Social Club before you're allowed to play. Then the audio is not working correctly and you need to fiddle with Windows settings to get any audio from Rift headphones. To top it off, main menu is black screen and I cannot play the game.","Mar 31, 2018 at 10:34 PM",1, 18,
2022-05-28 15:21:05.780641,WBaskerville,Love it!,"I don't know what some of you are complaining about, if you have the appropriate gaming system for VR the game works nicely and although you have to get accustomed to the controls in the beginning in the end they are doing just fine. Sure you don't get the full and chronological storyline of the original game but the 7 cases are beautifully crafted and amazingly immersive due to the brilliantly created atmosphere of the film noir genre. Walking is a bit clunky but  shooting and especially fighting and driving are a great fun. Love this game, I really hope Rockstar Games includes further cases.","Apr 6, 2018 at 6:48 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:21:05.795601,haptic,,"The only legitimate bugs I encountered in the game is some stuttering in certain locations (on a 1080, but not enough to really be a distraction) and the sound comes out of the primary speakers not the rift headphones at first. Once I got used to the controls and had customized them in options menu the game played beautifully and is a really fun experience. Good stories, good atmosphere, nice mixup of driving, shooting, investigating and interrogation.","Mar 31, 2018 at 4:45 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:21:05.811558,SadGamerDad,Locomotion not working!,"UPDATE: I was able to get the locomotion working by holding down the right stick for a couple of seconds to get the calibration screen to load. Just a quick click wasn't doing the trick. That being said, the arm swing locomotion is faster than stick HMD movement for chasing perps but tends to get stuck with objects in tight spaces. Updated my score to 3 stars. Why just 3 stars? because there isn't a lot of content here but it's ok enough for now a wow moment type experience. I tried to stream this, setup a new Rockstar social account, can only get to the office and desk and grab the items. None of the locomotion options (Arm Swing, Head, Hand) work whatsoever. Only the right stick click camera reset works. I can only grab what I can reach via room scale movement of myself. How did this leave the door? Maybe it'll work after a restart? Or needs a patch?  totally disappointing as I loved this game in 2D.","Apr 14, 2018 at 2:06 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 15:21:08.942184,mariussl,Must have for police/detective lovers,"This is a truly excellent game. For $30 with 7 different cases (which are much longer than they sound), it is well worth the penny. The rockstar sign in when you launch the game is a nuisance, but it is not at all a problem. If you don't already have an account, its the same thing as signing up for a amazon account. There are no major bugs that I've experienced on a GTX 1070. Touch controls are great. The only major problem is the tutorial. The way the tutorial explains things is very ""different"", but you'll figure it out","Apr 2, 2018 at 2:43 PM",5, 3,

I fortunately did not encounter any issues that were mentioned in other comments/reviews. I have an Intel i7 7700k, GTX 1080 ti with the latest drivers. The only thing that might make the experience even beter is a third sensor, which I'm going to order.","Apr 2, 2018 at 10:42 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:21:08.973102,Krasniye,"Good fun, but the whole game isn't here.","Let me just start by saying that I have only had minor bugs. I've heard some hardware configurations have game breaking bugs but I have the recommended specs exactly and didn't suffer anything major.

Negatives:
-The whole game isn't here. Just a bunch of the cases from the original (and a few of the DLC)
-Because of this the pacing is really weird. After you become a detective the game throws the continuity out the window. It becomes just about the cases as opposed to the story of Cole Phelps. 
-The game doesn't show you which cases you've completed and which you haven't. This makes the first time you're put into the office to select cases really confusing. I found myself having to manually start each one to see if I've played it or not. 
-Required Social Club. It's not SUPER terrible and intrusive like people say, the only time you really have to deal with it is logging in the first time. 
-The game needs administator permission to launch, this is a minor gripe but you have to go to your computer and press ""yes"" when you launch the game instead of doing it completly from the Oculus or SteamVR VRUI. Minor gripe but a bit annoying.

Positives:
+The atmosphere and graphics are really cool. 
+Interacting with stuff feels good
+Driving, although a bit hard to get used to is actually really well implemented (tip: use BOTH hands not just one and it becomes way better)
+Incredibly Immersive when doing cases. You really feel like a detective
+For a game not built on VR it's a really impressive feat. 

Neutral/Comments:
Locomotion is a bit hard to get used to but it's perfectly workable in my experience. I really wish they would have an option to just walk around with the joystick though. It would be less clunky

I really hope more cases are added eventually so it can play out like the full story instead of just selecting missions.","Apr 4, 2018 at 7:10 AM",4, 9,
