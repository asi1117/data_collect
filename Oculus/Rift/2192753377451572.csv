2022-05-28 18:29:01.690730,Elfien,It was good,"It's a good way to learn and the idea is definitely there. More lessons would be cool and its a little buggy (like when I speak it thinks I said something else. There's a skip button when needed so it's not too big of a deal). Overall I enjoy it though.
It has a lot of potential and Im excited to see where it goes in the future.",Dec 25 at 6:24 AM,4, 6,
2022-05-28 18:29:01.705690,TsaberX,Not bad,"It has some audio issues when outside, sometime multiple sounds going at the sound time.
It recognized your voice about 80% of the time so you will need to repeat a few times.

2022-05-28 18:29:01.720651,RollingPotatoe,Has some glaring issues,"The idea is nice and the game is probably worth it for a few dollars,
but it really needs to be more polished to be good. 
The sentence recognition appears to be a bit broken in Japanese. Sometimes a word is written in Kanji in the example sentence, but then the voice recognition will pick it up in Hiragana or with Arabic numerals instead and count that as a miss. Since the range of acceptable answers are very limited I suspect that there is some kind ''good answers'' list that has to match perfectly and lacks some sentence writing variations.",Sep 3 at 8:25 AM,3, 9,

You can fix the problem by disabling Oculus Virtual Audio Device from sound settings.

Follow the instructions below to do so: 
1. Right click on the speaker icon on the bottom right icon tray. 
2. Click on ""Open sound settings"". 
3. In the ""Input"" section, choose ""Headset Microphone (Oculus Virtual Audio Device)"" as your input device. 
4. Click on ""Device properties"" 
5. In the pop-up window, tick the checkmark for 'Disable'

2022-05-28 18:29:01.753562,Akrie2020,Limited,"So I am a Japanese American fluent in English and Japanese. 
I think this game has HUGE potential, and I am looking forward to the updates in the future!

I am giving 4 stars for the French language, and 1 star for the Japanese language.

I tried French first. I can speak very little French but it was great to learn through the simulation! What I loved about was that it will give you some freedom of answering the questions, and not limited to the choice that shows up on the right-side panel. 
I also gave a try on Japanese. Japanese doesn't give you any freedom. Even all the choices were grammatically wrong (taxi was bad), you will have to say exactly the sentences that are shown on the choice. It's kind of bad that you need to read the wrong Japanese in order to finish your course...
Other than that, I think it's great!
I am going to try German next!","May 4, 2021 at 5:59 AM",3, 12,"Hi, thank you for your feedback - we have accounted for it.

The rote memorization and paroting of entire phrases feels limited.   I would love to see a classroom mode with more detailed progressive lessons.

On the techincal side:
 In conversations where a second speaker arrives, often parts of the interface did not move to the new viewing angle.

there were also some interesting scaling problems when transitioning to the cutscenes (everyone got about 25% larger?)",Aug 23 at 8:02 PM,2, 1,

2022-05-28 18:29:04.950013,helenhelenbobelen,Impressed - Learning Vietnamese,"Vietnamese isn't an easy language to learn (for me anyway) mainly because of the tones used when speaking it, this seems to recognize the tones when I speak during the lessons, forcing me to get it right  (most of the time, it does slip every once in a while.)  FYI: This uses a North Vietanamese accent, and I want to speak with south accent, but it's close enough.  I usually get bored quickly with other language learning apps, but with VR, definitely keeps your interest.  This is a great tool to get started.  Recommended.","Jan 5, 2021 at 12:46 PM",4, 2,"Hi there, thank you so much for your kind words and for your support - we're happy to see that you enjoy learning with Mondly and that you keep practicing your Vietnamese.

2022-05-28 18:29:08.048725,Alicia_Wonderland,Pretty but glitchy & not educational,"I went to a French school as a child and spoke perfect French when I was thirteen but haven’t practiced at all and wanted to brush up. Out of curiosity I tried the beginner level which was easy for me but a newbie would have no idea how to pronounce anything! And several times when I responded with something simple like “nine o’clock” that I learned in kindergarten, it showed the correct answer that I said but the character kept saying she couldn’t hear or understand me. It couldn’t understand “Los Angeles”  even though that was one of the supplied answers. A few times I had to yell my answer several times louder and louder because it kept saying it didn’t hear me because noise was too loud but I was in a perfectly quiet room. My responses showed up written correctly but the AI couldn’t “hear” it. This was with the Quest2 and Oculus link BTW.

The locations were nice and immersive and the AIs were cool (although they all looked pretty similar) which is why I’m giving this three stars but I really don’t see how one could learn a language with this. If I didn’t know how to pronounce things, I don’t see any way I could have figured it out. In French there are many letters at the end of a word that are not said aloud but someone who didn’t know the language wouldn’t know that. 

Also the story had no continuity. In the taxi I chose the career of doctor from the list but then later when someone asked my career, doctor was no longer a choice. When I ordered red wine and a salad at the restaurant, I was given a croissant and coffee. When I asked the taxi driver to take me to the beach, (one of the choices) he took me to a hotel. If this was a choose your own adventure type story with continuity while learning a new language, this would definitely be a great app. 

The concept is great but the execution needs a lot of work.","Nov 7, 2020 at 12:02 PM",3, 13,"Hello from Mondly! Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're constantly working on improving our speech recognition feature but we might also be limited by the technology available.

2022-05-28 18:29:08.095599,lekcinnave,It doesnt teach grammer,"this is the worst form of learning a language i have tried 
1. Teaches no grammer or alphabet
2. Has terrible voice reconnition(in german i wasnt able to get it to register the word being said, it would tell me to try again and all that. it only worked if i said it in a hillbilly southern accent (i.e.: Katze woudnt work but ""el cat zee"" would work everytime)
3. (at least for german) just pernounce everything with a really southern yee haw accent and sound it out in english and it will register but pernounce it in german and it wont reconize 
I dont understand how you can claim that this will teach someone a language but leave somthing so important as grammer and alphabet out.

2022-05-28 18:29:11.228221,narnia649,English -> Japanese Review,"Overall, I really liked the game and gameplay. I thought it was an interesting way to supplement learning Japanese and force me to start looking at Kanji. Additionally, I like the 'snail' speak to slow things down. 

For the Japanese part, I thought it would have been cool to be able to turn on / off the Hiragana & Katakana instead of Romaji. Also, be able to turn on / off the Furigana (little hiragana above the kanji) to better assist. As well as give those options for your responses on the right. The general options given on the right didn't have the romaji support, so I had to listen really hard to make sure I knew what they were saying. It would have been nice to have the option to turn those on / off. Maybe there is a way, but I didn't find it.","Sep 13, 2020 at 8:33 AM",4, 5,"Hello, thank you for your kind words and for your support.

2022-05-28 18:29:11.274098,LAWLYSS,Has potential,"This could be a great app for practicing a langauage. I would not say it is so practical for teaching a new language without prior understanding. You can get through the simulation but  you will just learn memorized phrases which is not really learning the langauage, just memorizing. If the microphone were improved this could be a very usueful tool for practice. I speak beginner turkish fairly clearly according to my turkish friend but the microphone in the app could not properly recognize my speech about have the time. It was quite frustrating. This app has great potential if the microphone issue can be fixed.","Dec 9, 2020 at 6:35 PM",3, 0,Hello from Mondly! Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

2022-05-28 18:29:14.349872,Bureaucracy,,"Can't wait to see more and more improvements go into this and this concept explode. As someone thats been doing duolingo (Eng-German) fairly heavily (1-2k exp a week for 5-6 weeks) even the initial levels are a little on the deep end of my league (without 'cheating' by using the suggestions). 
I don't have a problem with this though, as someone that only knows one german(language you are learning) speaking friend having the opportunity to speak back and forth like this is invaluable. I can't wait to come back to this in a month with a little more vocabulary under my belt.

One side note the talk-to-text can be a little janky occasionally but thats just as likely the quest microphone. 

Seriously if you are somewhere past absolute beginner (around the point of formming basic sentences that would come up in small talk) in a supported language but lack a real life 'talking' bag, this is game changing and an awesome utilisation of technology.","Jul 13, 2020 at 7:19 PM",4, 5,"Hi, thank you so much for your kind words, we're happy to hear that we've managed to immerse you into a German speaking environment.

2022-05-28 18:29:17.500445,Mizu1993,"Got better, from 3 to 4 stars","First it says, if I have any idea to make it better, I should write the company. Which I also will, but first, I love languages and I can speak already a few. The tutorial is nice and for the first language VR game it is okay. Things that you could have done better is: If they say it once, it doesn't need to be slower. There is no option to listen to it again in normal speed. For languages like japanese, chinese, korean,... if you don't know how to read the signs, you are lost. It only translate in your language, but it doesn't show how to speak the kanji for example. That is really sad. Especially my next goal is to learn chinese, that will be super difficult with this app. Another thing is, it is more luck based if the software understands you. Even if I speak it correctly and it is even written down there correctly, but the app still does not let me pass. The instructor has really bad jokes and sounds more like a robot, but okay. Even there are some mistakes made in there and not everything is perfect, I don't regret that I bought this, but if you can update and make it better, please do so mondly.

Update: Since there was an update, the game has gotten a bit better, but there are still some problems which makes me cringe. Especially in japanese. If I talk and say 分かりました (wakarimashita), it shows it to me in kanji. Not a problem for me, I love kanji, but a problem for the program, since it only allows わかりました. How should I talk the same word without kanji interfering? ^^"" I don't know.","Apr 12, 2020 at 3:54 PM",4, 19,"Hello, you're right - we do want you to share your feedback with us so thank you for doing so.

2022-05-28 18:29:17.549315,Sculpting,Helps build confidence with language use,"I was really pleasantly surprised to find this app so helpful. It gives me a more natural context to use language and associate the phrases with relevant context and situations. I am not embarrassed to make mistakes, repeat phrases, and can learn at my own pace. I especially find the text helpful to reinforce my understanding of spelling and pronunciation. 

As for areas that can be improved, please move the bell location from the hotel desk. My hand continuously triggered it trying to open the dialogue window that it blocked while talking with the concierge. 

I was thrown when speakers change gender and voice mid-phrase. Can you keep the voice of the person you are talking to in each scene consistent? 

Can you consider including pronunciation practice for reading syllables/alphabets as an introduction option before diving into a scene? 

Please include a “rest” option where you can sit in a public space and overhear conversations or background music with translation. I like the idea of taking in language with immersion in a VR space. 

Would also love to see more outcome choices affected by dialogue prompts if possible. Enjoyed my language learning experience a lot and look forward to seeing it develop!

Lastly, please give me an option to set my name as a speaker! Your program keeps trying to force a name assignment on me every time I fill in the blank and it’s extremely frustrating to be called a name I don’t recognize.

2022-05-28 18:29:20.706869,badsalad,Seriously a game-changer,"I read through some of the other reviews on here, and I suspect that many of those people have never seriously worked on learning a new language. You can read grammar books, and fill in the blanks on your worksheets, but ultimately the biggest step to take is internalizing the language and maintaining a conversation without having to translate back and forth into/from your native tongue in your head. Mondly clearly understands that, and everything about this app seems to be built around it.

First of all, the fact that the entire app is built around conversations is perfect. It gives a context to the language learning process, so we're not rote memorizing random lists of vocab words, but learning how they fit into a conversation. We also have multiple response options, so we can practice saying different things, and move the conversation in a slightly different direction each time we run through it. It's also great that Mondly allows you to take your time, repeat phrases as much as you need to, peek at the translation of each response, hear it in slow motion, etc. Great for pausing and using context to really understand each phrase.

If they wanted to make this a more complete language-learning platform, it might not hurt to have lessons in between the conversation exercises - where we're taken to a classroom, and a teacher explains a concept or grammatical construction, and a few new vocab words. But again - all that stuff, you can get from any conventional language-learning resources. The conversations are what's most important.

Besides this app, the only way to truly pull that off is to be in an in-person class that immerses you in the language on a regular basis, or otherwise to move to the country whose language you're learning, and dive in completely. The language-learning shift takes place on a subconscious level, and so immersion is absolutely necessary to round out the learning process.

I think Mondly should get way more attention than it seems to get.","Apr 11, 2020 at 12:30 AM",5, 3,"Hi badsalad, thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback with us and for your amazingly kind words. We're so happy to see that you're placing as much emphasis on immersion on learning languages as we do and we promise that, as time passes, we'll have more content, conversations and scenes.

2022-05-28 18:29:23.804585,BKW125,Forced Review,Not a bad game for the first few minutes but when I got to the end of the 2nd module of learning my selected language the game forced me to stop and write a review. I couldnt simply select write a review in game - so I had to leave the VR set up and use my cell to write this for a game that I just purchased. I dont understand the arm twisting logic here as it would have been much friendlier to allow me the option vs holing my game progress hostage and making me write this- I'm sure the frustration is showing as I was in a bit of a zone and thought the game play and progress was working nicely. I hope this gets me back in if not il request a refund for sure.,"Mar 1, 2020 at 10:02 AM",3, 10,"UPDATE: Issue is now fixed! Hi,I'm really sorry to hear that. While we do want you to share your experiences and we want to hear all about it - so we'll know where we need work and where we're doing good, we'd never force you to leave a review.

I have tried using different microphones and nothing works. I have even tried messing with the windows settings to change audio input but it still does not work. This is a broken app. Please fix this ASAP as I love the idea...I just can't use it in its current state.
It might be a good idea to include a Mic check feature so users can see if their voice is being heard or not...would certainly make trying to fix the problem easeir on the user end.
Suggestion: add Hmong as a language! I would happily pay for this feature since it is a difficult language to find classes in.

The intro takes far too long and can't be skipped - I really don't want to see me packing my suitcase, boarding the plane and going through the train station every time I switch the game on. 
I chose Spanish to learn. One of the first few things to say was ""pleased to meet you"". As possible answers there is ""encantada"" or ""encantado de conocerte"". Now why is one with an ""a"" and one with an""o""? I'm guessing it depends on whether the speaker is male or female, but I want an explanation before I choose! Absolutely useless.

Looking forward to more!,"Only Episode 1 has been released of the Japanese section I took, but I enjoyed immersing myself in VR for a more engaging learning environment. Speaking to the digital avatars made me feel like I was using knowledge in a real-life context. Instead of speaking as I would in a classroom setting (slower, more methodical, but less natural), I found myself speaking as if I would to another person.

In the future I'm hoping for...
*Faster reaction time: I disliked waiting five-to-ten seconds just to try again when I failed to respond correctly. It stacks easily.
*Being tested on identifying what symbols in my learning language mean.
*Account-integration with my mondly account: I have mondly on mobile and it's a great app. The leveling system on their helps me gauge my progress.
*Much more content. The $4 I paid on sale price was more than worth the one episode, but covering the entire Mondly curriculum would be awesome.

It's more a collection of random vowels and conversations. No learning path.

There are also some issues that deserve attention e.g. when i'm asked in the train conversation what time it is, the app understands what i say (""Neuf heures"") but writes it differently (""9h"") and count it as an error. So to go on, i have to skip this part.

But a few things to keep in mind: The phone app of this is more extensive. The go version costs half from what i saw but I'm not sure if the content is exactly the same.
The navigation is simplistic and the speech registers well (At least for me. Other people might run into issues.)
However some translations are fairly rough, you get repeats/similar type of answers and questions in the same dialogue, the difficulty is not very high (basically just some tourist situations) while difficult at the same time: non-roman alphabet letters have no phonetics or roman pronunciation like in google translate. And its not offering a whole lot (yet?) will there be future free or purchaseable lessons? I'm also not sure if people will actually memorize the words and sentences properly like this there should be more memorizing exercises like in the phone app. Vocabulary trainer. Anything.
I hope this or similar programs get developed further in future.","Aug 29, 2019 at 3:44 AM",3, 5,"Hello, thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

2022-05-28 18:29:42.834685,Amadhia,A great start for a VR Langue App,"I'm studying Japanese, so I've only tried the Japanese scenarios -- I can only speak about those experiences.

It's got a lot of potential, and I sincerely hope the developers hone this app futher.

I'd love to see further developments to emulate having an actual tutor, (I've studied with a RL tutor a few years ago and found it very helpful).  'Cause at the moment it throws you into conversational experiences without going over foundation materials first, (eg: the Kana ""alphabets"" that the expected responses are written-in).

I was surprised by the voice recognition.  When asked my profession, I replied ""Artist"" (in Japanese,) and the recognition got that correct.  However, the app was not built to recognize that as a valid response.  It did recognize ""student"" (also in japanese) which was off-script WRT the responses, but the app did recognize that as a proper response.

I look forward also to users getting involved in the user-to-user practice.  (When I visited the chat room, it was totally empty.)

I'm quite surprised that the app didn't impliment some form of ELIZA.  (And I hope the devs read this and make it happen.)  With how good the speech recognition is, it should be simple to make a ""real feeling"" chat-bot even if they don't update the scripts that powered the ELIZA version from the '60s.

To sum-up:
It's got a HECK of a lot of potential.
I understand that it's a huge undertaking to do this.
What they've got in place is a great framework and first step toward a fantastic application of VR as a learning tool.
At the moment, it costs the same as a latte from Starbucks and this app is infinetely more helpful than anything I've ever gotten from Starbucks.
I hope the devs are heartened by the response they are receiving and continue to develop this app into the learning environment I know it can be!","Jul 31, 2019 at 11:37 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 18:29:45.941376,Luften,Kanji and Kana mix up for Japanese,"There are a lot of prompts that ask for numbers or even just basic phrases that are often spelt out in kana instead of kanji. For example Numbers will be in Kanji in the prompt but when you speak the recognition software puts in the alphanumeric and not the kanji, moreover the prompt will have わかりました in a larger phrase (ex: わかりました．ありがとうございました) but the recognition will input the kanji equivalent of wakaru (分かる) making it mismatch and frustrating.
The app is great for getting your toes wet and start speaking. Sometimes you have to really exaggerate pronunciation but it's still pretty ok. I suggest adding the option of furigana for kanji because swapping between romaji and kana gets frustrating when you know hiragana and katakana but not enough kanji.","Sep 11, 2019 at 6:42 AM",3, 3,"Hello, thank you so much for your suggestions- we'll do our best to follow through.

2022-05-28 18:29:45.992239,Tyrthemis,This has potential,"I would love to learn a language this way.  This game needs some serious love as far as realism in the vocabulary part, and I'd really like some speed settings for how quickly they talk.  Some better audio equipment and voice acting would be nice.  But the whole theory of the game, I love it.","Jun 11, 2019 at 3:02 PM",5, 8,"Hi and thanks for the feedback.

2022-05-28 18:29:46.008197,mark.berbezier,Suprisingly good!,"Once you get over the initial strangeness of the voice-samples changing between different people (they do sound like actual native speakers though which is good) it does get quite immersive and you do feel you have to make the effort to pronounciate correctly (without the pressure of doing it in front of people)! I can see this being a great framework to learning - top idea by the developers, I hope they build on the scenarios and content!

I dropped on star as I couldn't find any options around volume settings (it was very loud) or a way to check the mic volume. It took a few goes to realise I had to hold down the oculus controller button to get it to record/listen to my voice. Hopefully this will be considered in a future release if development continues!","Jul 13, 2019 at 7:51 PM",4, 4,

I passed the lessons ok. So then I wanted to check out the English version to see actually how good this thing is.  It had me in hesterics.
