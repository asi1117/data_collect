2022-05-28 14:08:16.701544,Beelzegan,"Best mechanics, lacks guidance","Honestly, this game is a blast. Like even though the graphics are not incredible, the characters neither and everything, the diversity in the classes, the mechanics in these ones, the fights against bosses, everything just feels right. Not 2 classes are alike. It feels good to tank with a big shield to protect yourself, heal by playing music while dodging abilities etc... <3
The dungeons are cool, the raid is pretty neat and fun to do. 
However, as said in the title, you're quickly just sent on your own and have to figure out what the hell you're supposed to do. I tried coming back to the game after a few months, I didn't understand any of my old quests and where I was supposed to go. Just give it that slight guidance to help people understand where they should go for quests, and you will win my heart again.",Jan 29 at 6:34 PM,4, 42,

There is zero(0) pay to win, it is not possible to ptw in this game, ignore the ignorance of any review saying otherwise. No premium currency or cashshop items you can trade or anything like that no boost or way to buy your level. This game is all about skill.",Jan 2 at 10:32 PM,5, 12,

2022-05-28 14:08:19.915535,SurgloaYok,A BANGER start for a VR MMO!!,"How can I start... ITS AMAZING. Orbus Vr Reborn takes you into this wonderful fantasy world with creatures of the nature and big skeletons and so many more monsters to fight and learn about. At first I was skeptic I did some research on YouTube you know and I saw some pretty good reviews and then a few ehh reviews and after hearing about Zenith coming out I was wondering if I should sleep on Orbus VR and go for Zenith. 

BUT WAIT!! Listen!! 

Now first yes there’s still small bugs like, Sometimes when I log in I go invisible or in the ground for people and I have to end up logging off. Second of all sometimes when you walk outside to HighSteppe and fight a creature or out of no where you can’t move or it’s super slow even after done fighting the Monster, But that’s fix by a log off but it’s annoying when it happens. 

Out of all though I been learning about dragons and the rarity behind them how people are really into buying certain PURE breed dragons for a lot of Dram. I’m using Rune mage class and it’s been challenging but I love it! I been getting the hang of it and it’s a wonderful time casting spells. There’s crazy talents to learn to make classes cooler and stronger. (Also BIG BOSSES and cool dungeons) 
I SHALL BECOME THE GREATEST!!! 

 I’ve spent At least 8-10 hours into the game so far and I’m learning it’s been amazing and the community is wonderful. DONT SLEEP ON THIS GAME!! it’s a awesome experience and if you just put a little effort in the beginning with the game I’m SURE you’ll be hooked. 

I bought two copies one for me and my nephew and now I’m about to buy 1 more for a buddy haha. I’m sure to get Zenith VR and will see how that is but I love this game already!!! GET THIS GAME! 
But thank you though Orbus team I’m thankful for a game in Vr like this, and I hope it gets way more updates in the future cause I’m about to get the dlc and cool items in game so I’m ready to make this a addiction, it’s become a favorite. (TIP) Ask around for help or watch YouTube videos to learn about the game, it will definitely pull you in more. ENJOYYY!!!","Mar 22, 2021 at 11:49 PM",5, 80,

There is a lot of content put into this game. I'm not very good at making good reviews. However i am extremely good at complaining. The trailers really do not do justice for the game. They look weird, out of place, and cringy. Luckily this makes it hilarious so overall 10/10","Feb 4, 2021 at 10:28 AM",5, 74,

And no, I'm not saying that you wont get bored at all, I myself have hade to take atleast a 2 week break from the game.

The Runemage class is a DIFFICULT class and is not bugged
If you don't like what players say mute em
My ign is as of rn Pogchamp Thewise, if you want to ask me a question about the game after purchase, I'm can generally be found near Randal at the beginning and around Highsteppe at the fellowship courtyard or by the player house. (m-thurs from 12pm to 4:30pm PST)

If you plan on changing class and want to keep your current profile but don't know how or have a question, JUST ASK.

If you are planning to buy this game
CONS
the game tends to crash somewhat frequently (doesn't bother me too much)
the game's audio breaks sometimes and you can't hear other players (fix this by going to the settings menue and click ""logout"" at the bottom of general)
tutorial does NOT teach you even a tenth of the fundamentals

PROS
the player comunity is the BEST and least toxic comunity i've ever seen
almost all players lvl 15+ are willing to help with any questions you may have
good main story quests
super easy to make friends
every class has a different level (so you could have a lvl 30 paladin and a lvl 10 musketeer)


The activities you can do in this game include but are not limited to:
completing quests
Grinding rare drops
leveling up
dungeons
raids (lvl 30)
market stalls & auction house
breeding/selling dragons
dungeon shards (lvl 30)
making friends
world pvp
pvp battlegrounds
grinding pot
creating a guild
joining a guild

If you have any questions after purchasing the game feel free to look for me, I can usually be found near the begining area. My username is Pogchamp. I would be glad to help

2022-05-28 14:08:26.222899,Overrated_Potato,100 percent cap free,"This has to be one of the best vr games especially online. It has one of the best communities out there. I remember the first time I played I was lost and pretty confused but I asked someone for help and they helped me a lot they even gave me like 100 ingame money so I could buy something for the mission even though he just started and it was very hard to get money at the beginning. I really appreciate this game. There's a lot of love in this game and it's very apparent. Although there is some problems with it. 

The problems. There's acouple I'm not going to lie, there isnt a lot of diversity when it comes to npc in orbus it's usually just little groot looking creatures they all have the same premise big groot small groot explosive groot wizard groot dark groot and so on but even though this game is a really huge challenge especially if you're playing solo. This is not a game for solo playing  you must make friends to continue in the game if you're even 1 level short you will lose BADLY especially in dungeons not even the best gear can have to defeat a dungeon solo. The story I heard was good but it's difficult to get into it.  They only give you small hints like ""Go to this place and find this man"" which fun fact the main story is pretty easy for beginners but out of no where it gets impossible. They make you go from the easy area to the ""If you step foot in here you'll die in a second"" So you have to dodge the mobs it took me almost 2 hours to find this one man. Or another bad quest is like find 6 sticks but you need specific sticks that you cant just search up on the internet which is pretty annoying.

The positive, I love the combat system, the combat system in this game is immaculate there is so many classes. Oh you need a healer bam healer you need a runemage? bam runemage archer you got it tank duh obviously so many cool classes. There is a negative and that is that some classes are better than others like runemage is probably best for solo because it's a dp","Sep 27, 2020 at 6:27 AM",5, 24,

2022-05-28 14:08:29.448391,Zaphi67,More frustration than fun,"I tried a magician first. Spells are cast by drawing runes in the air. Unfortunately, this only works sporadically, even after a lot of practice, and was the reason for me to try other classes. Unfortunately, it is similar here. With pistol you have to make arcuate movements to give the bullet a sling that does more damage. Unfortunately, you rarely hit the target then. In the end, you stand in front of an opponent for minutes until he is finally defeated. This annoys everything more than it is fun, and fishing is more of a torture than relaxation. The controllers collide when the roller is cranked. The line breaks too quickly. I also feel somehow overloaded with the many things on my belt. I often hit my knees when I reach for it. In an online multiplayer game, you spend more time than in ordinary games. It should therefore be playable in a relaxed sitting position. Another big problem is: The Game is not in german language. In a normal game I can at least google quickly on my cell phone if I don't understand any words. Not possible with VR set, or very tedious. Therefore I could not find a German community. I found a Facebook group outside of the game. Unfortunately, all but one of the members have been inactive for a long time. The reasons are probably the same.
I give 2 stars for the really cute dragons, and the dragon race, which was really successful.
All in all, the game has a lot of potential, with plenty of room for improvement. I will check in again and again, hoping for updates.","Jun 12, 2020 at 4:28 PM",2, 7,

That being said, the Runemage class is supposed to be easy to learn since the runes to cast the spells aren't that hard to draw which is my only problem in the game: the detection of how the runes are drawn are so poorly done, not only do the shortcuts people make are still hard to do, doing it the right way is even worse, it almost never detects that I've done the shape correctly.

2022-05-28 14:08:35.721829,tw1ztid,Shell of the game it used to be,"Preborn Era was a promising vrmmorpg, but Reborn is not an MMORPG anymore it is a centralized hub mmo. There is one city you do everything in and you only leave to follow the main story or to do kill quests. There is no exploration, no good questing, little variety in enemies, the world feels smaller, and level scaling has been poorly done.
The game has taken multiple steps backward in my opinion, but honestly it is probably more the fact that they changed the style of the game away from being an mmorpg into a cell phone quality hub mmo. I wish I knew this disappointment was their end-game so I wouldn't have supported it years ago.

If you aren't a big fan of mmorpgs then this game is for you and you might actually kind of enjoy it, especially if you didn't play the older version and get spoiled by the world they were building. Just don't expect an actual mmorpg.","Mar 3, 2020 at 9:03 AM",1, 21,
2022-05-28 14:08:35.738292,Apex-Rex,5 & 2 star,"pros: 
- this is an awesome concept kinda like SAO and has so much potential. this makes up for many cons for me
- variety of classes 
- feel like a large world ""kinda""

cons:
-lvl cap is 30 should be higher
- open mic chat so annoying so sick of the 9 year olds screaming and yelling acting stupid just ruins the game
- graphics are terrible adding some skin covers on their objects will not be that much more demanding 
- classes have no progression when you level up no new skill or anything 
- minions to strong you try to explore get ganked by 3 monsters stand no chance alone 
- feels kinda empty no flow to missions or stories and explanations of anything is non exsistant be prepaired to google everything 
- developers do not listen to their following at all

conclusion:
there is alot more i wanted to say but wanna kep it short and to the point. its a good fun game gets boring and repetitive  with no depth to anything in it. i would still pay $40 to support them in hopes they will listen to the community and make changes because if they do this will probably be one of the best games ever created","Nov 9, 2019 at 2:02 PM",3, 36,

2022-05-28 14:08:38.897951,FieryWaters13,(Edit) This game has improved massively!,"(Edit) This game is really fun! A lot of bugs are being fixed, and each of the classes look really cool! It seems like there's a ton of content to explore, and there is actually a fairly active community to play with! There are still lots of bugs, but I had a lot of fun playing!!

I think this game has great potential but as it is there are so so many bugs, many of which are game breaking!

That being said, I think this game has potential. I see that it's updated nearly constantly, and I have hope that in a year or two it might actually be something worth investing my time into. That being said, I'd like to give a couple critiques for the Devs:

1) The tutorial system isn't very helpful and is somewhat confusing. Consider walking the user through more of each of the mechanisms rather than relying on googling/text explanations.

2) Fix the bugs. This was a while ago, but there ws a bug that an enemy I attacked wouldn't die, and also another where they didn't target me. The AI just seemed buggy overall.

3) Improve the graphics. This game could be awesome without good graphics, and I would focus on this last, but when the machanics and controls are clunky, the game is glitchy, and everything looks really low res, there just isn't much to motivate me to come back.

4) Controls are clunky. I just don't like the book, and there doesn't seem to be a good flow for the menu's and such. That being said, I'm sure if I put more time into the game this aspect could improve.

Overall: Had I not sunk too much time into this game learning it(over 2 hours) I probably would have returned it. That being said, I don't completely regret it because I like to periodically check and see how much it's improved (and it's improved a lot). I honestly have very high hoped for this game as long as the Devs support it. If I stop seeing updates, I'll probably change this review to 1 star. If they manage to craft this gargantuan game into something smooth and enjoyable, I'll update to 5!","Sep 28, 2019 at 5:34 PM",4, 17,

It makes it feel like i am playing an MMO for the first time again and I thank you for that experience. I can not wait to log back in and that is a feeling that I have not felt in a long time. I have the Occulus Rift S and even though you have to have a high powered system to play with the rift S. it plays wonderfully. i9 9900, RTX 2080 32 gigs DDR4. I break maybe 62c for the graphics and 51c for the CPU after a two hour session. That is amazing to me. Back to the game.. i find it funny to watch people as they play. Some people read there quest outloud or others will perform for you as they notice you watching them, earlier this guy started grabbing this NPCs boobs lol. It was funny af and random. Anyways the game is worth the 40 bucks. Even if you have minimum MMO experience it is so worth it to see the view and the combat is amazing at that. I can not wait to try the other classes and the physics of some of the classes is amazing too. Just buy it and stop being dumb.

The perfect example of the game is a comment made last time I played by another player ""I don't care about leveling and hope we can pay to max out I just want to run raids""

The game used to promote open world play with boss fights and hunting parties. Now in present day reborn you run a few ""Kill 10 of this and that"" missions in WoW style and you are max level in an afternoon without ever leaving just outside of town. 

There are only for dungeons and they are the same at lvl 2 or lvl 30 just more HP and DMG from the mobs.

2022-05-28 14:08:45.161933,braemear,The Good the Bad and UGLY!,"The good: Alot of character classes; the quests are ok. In fact they should really stop creating classes and focus more on the game. The multiplayer is decent.

The bad: The game mechanics are herky jerky. When you are fighting it feels more like a card game then a fight where you can block and attack. I wish the developers looked at Karnage's game mechanics before they spent time and energy and had people suffer through theirs.

The UGLY: The graphics are absolutly UGLY. Once again look at Karnage, that is also mutiplayer CO-OP. These graphics are horrible. Each blade of grass looks rendered instead of a texture. I'm not sure what they were trying to do. Maybe appeal to three year old kids by making everything look like a 3 year old drew it. The graphics make this a completely non imersive experience. 

Don't waste your money. Karnage is closer to playable VR MMORPG. What Orbus has created is an odd ugly little duckling that unfortunatley will not turn into a  swan.","Jul 18, 2019 at 6:49 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 14:08:45.177890,taquitobuddy,"Lots of good, some bad","Really wanted to love this one since MMO's are my favorite non-VR genre, but I'll give the pros and cons and you can decide.

Pros:
-Devoted developers who are constantly updating the game
-Fantastic community, friendliest community of any game I've ever played
-The only VR MMORPG right now, and it has most of the traditional MMO features like quests, classes/roles, progression, gear, dungeons, professions, even PvP and more.
-Lots of players around the main town, so the game isn't dead

Cons:
-Tutorial/new player experience is much better than it used to be, but still insufficient.  The first several hours in the game are a mixture of tedious and confusing (luckily lots of helpful people around).
-While there are many players around the main town, I wasn't able to join a dungeon or battleground at all.  Maybe not enough people in queue, or maybe bugged.  Don't know, but I tried both and waited a long time before giving up.
-And finally the main issue: The combat just isn't fun, especially compared a number of other VR games.  My guess is this was to ensure Orbus runs on almost anything, but the lack of any kind of physics or feedback makes combat feel lifeless.  While I'm sure the devs will keep working on/improving the game, I very much doubt this one is possible to change at this point.

Bottom line: if you want a VR MMORPG, this is your only option for now and the near future.  It isn't terrible, but I hope in a year or two we have at least one other more impressive option.","Jun 20, 2019 at 12:57 PM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 14:08:48.372992,mhwood,Casual MMO with Much More Under the Hood,"The gameplay initially appears underwhelming and punishing in the first 10 hours until you really get your bearings straight; then you realize there are elements of exploration and discovery, traditional grinding, professions, interesting lore quests, daily quests for reputation grinds, cosmetic rewards, and a deeper than expected min/maxing at the endgame. Dungeons are an enjoyable experience (except for the mouth breathers or quitters) and while I haven't tried the new raid yet (still gearing myself in the challenge versions of dungeons) the world boss was a wild experience. Fellow players are nice and will help you out if you ask, and since there is intentionally not an online guide anywhere you will definitely be asking or else figuring things out through trial and error. The graphics are cartoon-esque and a little bland until you start venturing farther from the main city and see some really neat environments. The game does feel like it's in perpetual Beta - but that's sort of how MMOs work - as there are regular patches/updates for classes or content at no extra cost or subscription fee. You thankfully don't have to reroll to change your class; you can level up all the classes on your one toon so you don't have to redo reputations or keep track of multiple inventories. I've invested probably 40 hours into the game so far and it's a lot of fun; just get over that first hurdle of the learning curve and you'll find the Reborn world engaging and fun as well. :)","Jun 27, 2019 at 5:34 AM",4, 2,

Class development doesn't really change over the course of your leveling so you're lacking a any type of real character progression other than watching some arbitrary numbers go up. Some of the classes are severely boring to play with only a small number of abilities meaning there's not much adaptation you can do to different enemies/situations, you just repeat the same 3-4 moves for the entirety of your gameplay.

Most of the ""skill"" required in the class is actually a mix of moving your controller in just the right directions in sequence and a little bit of luck in whether the game actually registers your movement correctly (it frequently does not).

The interface design is somewhat terrible with your different skills placed often times in the most inconvenient of places without any way of moving things around. For example a shaman must reach down to grab an orb from the top of a totem they've thrown down so they can throw the orb at the enemy. Your totem bar for throwing down a new totem is placed right at your waist making it super easy to grab a totem instead of the orb which resets the orb spawn timer despawning the orb you could have thrown. 

Ultimately this game feels like it needs another year or so of design/development. Pick up this game if your idea of a good time is working around poor design, avoid otherwise.","May 27, 2019 at 5:29 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 14:08:54.680768,Carl1994,Great first VR MMO,"My first impressions of this game after a few hours of playtime are, it's worth the money and will likely keep me entertained for many, many hours. The combat technique of all the classes are unique and take advantage of you being in VR, The warrior for example you have a sword and shield, you need to time your attacks and blocks right to be effective, the ranger has a bow and arrow so accuracy is key, the mage has a wand and is one of the hardest classes to play, not only do you need to memorise the spells, you then have to draw them in the air to cast them, none of this simple press a button and your attack fires like a 2d MMO, this game takes skill.

The crafting in game requires you to physically grab the items and craft with them, whether it's potion making, following instructions you found and dropping the items into the couldren, in the correct order, or making lures for fishing by combining certain ingrediants to attract certain fish.

To collect resources you have to physically mine them when your harvest tool, to fish you need to cast your rod and reel it in, careful not to break the line, to race your dragon (yes, there's dragon racing) you have to use your head to guide them through the course.

I'm really looking forward to seeing what this game truely has to offer, I've not even got a full set of gear yet, but I've had a quick go with all the different weapons to see their playstyle and tried lots of little bits the game has to offer. There's still much more for me to explore like all the story missions, bigger world events and even 4 x 5 man dungeons to take on with friends who are picking up the game

The only real negative I have to say about the game is the graphics, the character models kind of look like they escaped from the nintendo Mii factory and the world itself certainly isn't going to have you simply staring at it for hours, but I can overlook graphics in a groundbreaking game, made for a niche market.

I then found inconsistencies with capitalisation in lists. Also, one item description was spelt incorrectly too. These were all spotted in just two to three hours of playtime. Ok, so I'm probably a stickler, but bad grammar is a major bugbear of mine in games, especially in ones I've forked out £30 for. I've refunded games before now for that sort of sloppiness. I know it's EA and there are probably more important priorities for you, but how long does it take to correct them? Or have they not been brought to your attention?

Anyway, enough of the negatives...

I've kept OrbusVR on my radar for a long while but was put off initially by the price. I then watched a couple of gameplay clips and was suitably impressed, so much so that I decided to bite the bullet and take the plunge into this brave new world and I'm glad I did.

Graphics are a little basic but I soon got used to them. Combat and questing...all good. Haven't had much chance to interact with fellow players at the moment so can't comment on the community.

OrbusVR is the first ""real"" VRMMORPG. For a first one, it is absolutely great! It respects the codes of a MMORPG, and VR integration is awesome as they leave many choices to the player. For example, the game handles every type of locomotion : teleport, smooth locomotion, rotation by incrementation,...
Performance is now great, great job!

Sadly there are a few things that really bring OrbusVR down.

First: the character should not slow down when entering a battle. I keep dying in battle because my character would suddenly stop moving.

Then, I think this game deserves a real map. The compass alone can only give directions, it is highly limited. Frankly, I have no idea where I am and where I want to go.

Finally, Teleport is also weird, as I have to wait for the ""teleport zone"" to reach the point where I want to go...

Really, if you can rectify that, the game would be near perfect to me.","May 3, 2019 at 8:16 PM",4, 2,

Next, the player customization. It really bugs me when you can't have spaces in an MMO name, a character that you role play as should be able to have a last name, like come on. Face shape choice? Gender choice? Why are my iris and my pupil flip flopped? Hair choices, shape and color, look bad as well. Miis have better customization than this as well.

Next, the tutorial, short sweet and to the point, I like it.

Next, the inventory, design is average, love the large amount of space compared to every other MMO out there however. Needs a sort button.

Next, community, I've met a few people and they were all pretty nice, which is great, but any game is great if its community is great. 

Next, combat, as a scoundrel. Limited sprint, no. Cards that apply affects, cool.
Curving shots, useless. Sights, zoom scopes with above or canted iron sights should be an option.

There will be more VR MMOs in the future which will do everything twice as well as this one for half the price, the only reason this game is the top VR MMO is because its the only VR MMO.

After the Reborn update/re-release/refresh (or whatever you call it) I can definitely say the game is a lot more polished. Everything is better developed and it really feels like the team put their heart in to making this. 
Though i don't think i can give the game a 5/5. The game is still very similar in both good and bad ways. I was really hoping they'd improve more on the combat. They've added new roles/classes that you can play as, and this adds some more variety, but the combat still feel pretty slow and non responsive. This would be fine for most regular MMOs but when it is in VR it can feel a lot more frustrating. 
Overall an amazing game, and i think it is absolutely worth the money, but if you're not that into MMORPGs, i don't think this will change your mind.

Original reveiw:
There is a lot of issues with the game, but those will hopefully be fixed with the release of OrbusVR: Reborn in the start of 2019.
Currently the performance is horrible. 
     Sometimes i manage to hit the 90fps mark consistantly, until it suddenly drops 
     to 40, and stays there. 
I've also been experiencing a few crashes, but the devs have helpfull guides on how to fix them. 
The graphics in the game is pretty bad, and characters look generic.
A few of the mechanics in the game like AI, UI, and some fighting elements has too be worked on.

Out from this the game doesn't sound that good, but it will be. Most of this is being worked on in OrbusVR: Reborn, with a much bigger team. 
They have game coders, artists, and more.
This ""update"" (rather, new game) will have much improved performance, hand drawn art, new enemies, new story, and a lot of new content. 

All in all OrbusVr is still a pretty fun game, and I will continue to play it until OrbusVR: Reborn comes out, but I am so extremely exited for the update.","Apr 25, 2019 at 4:23 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 14:09:04.256010,AerialSnack,The only MMORPG is amazing!,"This is currently the only MMORPG available for VR, and thankfully it's pretty darn good. The three most important parts of an MMORPG in my opinion are Combat, Community, and Content (The Three C's of MMORPGs!).

Combat: Some of the best for VR in my opinion. Warriors swing a sword and have a shield, combos based on directional swinging. Archers work like normal. Musketeers have a gun they can load special ammo into the front of. RuneMages use gesture based casting for over 10 spells using their wand (more like drawing). With 3 sensors I have had no issues in combat.

Community: Literally the best community out of any game ever. You can go up to just about anyone and ask for help and they'll help you. If you ask a random person where something is, there's a 50% chance they'll give you directions, and a 50% chance they'll lead you there themselves. I haven't met a single rude person on here.

Content: The bane of many VR games is that they're good, but they're short. The bane of many MMORPGs is that there's more grinding that actually playing the game. A VR MMORPG has a lot of potential to be very bad, but thankfully, the devs understand what consumers want. The world is huge. Just walking without a mount, it'd probably take a good 15-20 minutes to get from one end to the other. There are a lot of unique enemies with different move-sets. There a ton of dungeons, and there are even world bosses. Grind is present, but it's not overwhelming at all. You can almost max out a class just doing the main story line. There are a ton of sidequests as well.

Finally, the #1 best part about this game, is the devs. They communicate a lot, ask what we want, listen to feedback, and constantly improve the game. You know what the devs are doing with the money they earned from early access purchases? Completely overhauling the game. Straight up remaking it to be completely better in every aspect. Better mechanics, graphics, customization, more classes, more content, everything.","Dec 30, 2018 at 3:25 AM",5, 51,

2022-05-28 14:09:07.360844,Kevtendo,Honestly not worth the $40 pricetag.,"So i've played the game and honestly the game looks and plays like it cost $40 TO MAKE. 
I know people will try to justify it as ""it's pre-alpha"", and to that i say, ""if it's pre-alpha, they why does it have a $40 pricetag, especially with this quality of a game."" and if it's not in Pre-Alpha that's even worse.
it's not that it's a bad game and i can't see no one having fun, the main issue is the absurd price for a game that looks like it cost less to make.
 If it were free, or even $10 dollars that would be acceptable.
 The only real fun you get is from playing with other people or raids. (any game is fun when playing with people no matter how good/bad)
 I hope the game gets fleshed out and updated to become worth $40.

Orbus - $40
Skryim VR - $60

2022-05-28 14:09:07.393756,JustAnAverageJoe,Honestly an amazing game!!,"When going into this game one of the most important things to remember is to talk to people, I am usually an anti-social person, I tend to keep to myself and not say much. when I first played this game I found it lacking, not worth the money, and overall not an experience worthy of all the praise it was getting. However, I recently got back into it because the soon to be released reborn update with is to come out soon and I thought ""why not give it a second chance"" well I quickly realized how wrong I was when I first tried this game.
    The core thing I was missing was just talking to people, saying hello to someone and them saying something back. I know how much of a ""well duh"" thing that is but it's so important. I was learning things from other people I was watching wizards sitting in a circle teaching on another it was all amazing. I was walking around with compleat strangers having a blast talking as they helped me out with low-level quests, laughing, joking, and just having a good time. this is a game you NEED to be social to fully enjoy if you keep to yourself and just not say anything to anyone you'll more then likely find the game dull and uninteresting.
     now as much as I praise this game for having the social aspect that it does it isn't perfect. I feel like movement could have been implemented a tad better in terms of the locomotion options it has and it's definitely missing some quality of life things like a timer that shows you cooldowns on abilities for the musketeer (at least I haven't seen it I could just be blind and never noticed it). Graphics aren't very good (at least at the time of writing this review ( before the reborn update)) and there are some things that really aren't the games fault but limitations of VR itself.
     despite some of the problems I've mentioned and many more others have pointed out it is an amazing experience well worth the money and time you put into it, just dont be afraid to talk to people.","Mar 1, 2019 at 1:02 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 14:09:07.410711,HUGEnormous,Needs a lot of work.,"VR's only MMO leaves a lot to be desired. If you're a seasoned RPG/MMO player looking for an immersive fantasy experience that incites a sense of wonder, danger, magic, and rewarding combat, then Orbus -- in its current state -- may be very disappointing for you.

Once you familiarize yourself with the core mechanics and gameplay (by the time you get to Guild City), you may find yourself asking, ""Why did I spend 40 bucks on this game?"".  Here is why.

Immersion:
Everytime you open your journal and see an untextured square block of a page with an arial'ish type font on it; everytime you loot an item and open your inventory only to see a plain, uninspired, blocky-MS Paint-interface; and everytime you exit your house and have your eardrums ruptured by the random conversations of other players, your experience suffers. 

What little immersion the actual world of Orbus provides is quickly ruined by their horrible UI, graphics, stale combat, boring storyline (the physical in-game characters look nothing like their art in the cutscenes--Oscar has an earring in-game but doesn’t in cutscenes?), poor voice acting that doesn’t match cutscene art, and the mics of surrounding players (yeah, you can just mute everyone but still).

Combat: 
Boring. Once you figure out how to use the weapons there isn't anything exciting about your interaction with monsters. They come toward you and you spam them down. That is it. No satisfying dodge or timed blocks, no reflecting magical attacks, no grappling, controller buzzing when you release your drawn arrow. There is absolutely no difference in monster behavior. They all feel the same and you will feel the same despite leveling up and collecting gear.

Graphics:
This game very much looks and feels like Nintendo 64 Pokemon. If you’re a 32 year old man like me, this isn’t nostalgic, it is depressing.","Feb 9, 2019 at 12:00 PM",2, 9,

eg. As i'm playing FalloutVR i can be facing ANY DIRECTION, be close OR far from the sensors, lean over, back, under and over with ZERO sensor or controller latency. And the graphic are so much more cpu intense then this game. But yet its still increibly polished and smooth. The only reason i bring up another title is if THEY can do it then it can be easily done - if the Devs care, leaving me to assume that it is low on the Orbus very long ""todo"" list.","Feb 20, 2019 at 3:35 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 14:09:10.508013,Darkamisama,"Great concept, need improvement","I think the idea of open world mmorpg is great, but the combat in orbus was not as fun as I imagined (I think karnage chronicles has a better system when it comes to combat mechanics).

IMO, I liked Karnage Chronicle’s combat more because the monsters showed some reaction animation of being hit and some blood when I slash them with a sword. This small detail really makes it feel more immersive and REAL when compared to simply seeing damage numbers and health bar decreasing (currently, the monster show no animation of being hit and the only animation is when it dies).

I am not a tech guy, and I am just saying what I feel is lacking in the combat of orbus and why I don’t find it fun (so please don’t get offended if you believe the combat in orbus is perfect and believe it’s not possible to improve). In others word, I’m just saying what I think can help make the combat system more fun. Here is a link of what I’m talking about when it comes to animation of monster getting hit (maybe less blood if developers find it inappropriate). https://www.vrfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Karnage-Chronicles-Gif-1.gif 1

Some people mentioned to me that making every hit causing a monster to flinch (animation) is not possible (ex. the ranger can constantly deal hits and if the monster flinch every time it would break the game). IMO, rngeus can work and only have some atk make the monster flinch and the others just merely showing the monster reacting to the hit where the second animation doesn’t affect the monster hitting you (in other words, the first one actually have some battle advantage and the second is merely cosmetic).

All in all, combat is really a core component of mmorpg, so I really hope for the developers who are reading this review will consider adding more animation of the monsters getting hit to the combat (verses no animation or reaction right now)! This would make the combat more fun and the game 5 star!","Feb 15, 2019 at 7:23 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 14:09:13.705536,Mr.Ducky,Both 5 & 1 Star reviews are right.,"I took a moment to read through what other people put in their review to see if my experiance was atypical. And what it all comes down to is mindset and expectations. So I'll play devil's advocate here, and detail both sides of the good/bad argument. I've only gotten to level 10, about half way or what feels like the start to the rest of the game. Although, I haven't touched this game in weeks. 
The good; ------~
-For VR being a new frontier, no matter what the gripes are it's still a little bit stagering to enter the world and have so much freedom and control. Combat can be satisfying, if a little exausting if you play a melee class, which I do. Crafting is the start of something we all dreamed of if we've ever tried crafting in other mmos; you can physically drop ingrediants for a potion in yourself.
-Community; I've found nothing but friendly people when I needed them. With the expection of 75% of people with their kids screamin dogs barking or eating chips with their open mic stuck on. But that's open mic in a nutshell of any game, and why I never voice chat. The devs are amazing and are everywhere on the forums. Respondin to constructive criticism and outlining roadmaps for future updates. This game constantly updates and probably has a long future ahead of it. 
The Bad; -----~ 
Graphics; are absolutely attrocious. Not in presentation, but in design. Although, I can justify them in my mind. Picture, if you've ever seen them, the Miis from Nintendo's Wiis and onwards. All avatars are basically Miis. Smooth, detailess, generic. It's all kind of cell shaded with very few polygons. I like the idea of whats under the few polyons, and I know it's to save performance as VR is super demanding early on, but it's the one thing that keeps me from playing, it is just not fun to look at. At all. Some people won't mind, I can't stand it. I don't need AAA FX, I need something that doesn't feel like an elementary school education game. Anywhere in the middle I'd be happy with.","Aug 11, 2018 at 6:55 PM",3, 592,

Coming across Orbus VR was a dream come true, the first time jumping into the game and wandering around the town, just to have someone walk past and say hey made me stop for a minute and just take it in, later that evening I spent about an hour or so fishing with a couple of other low levels just chatting and helping each other out. This is the first time I've felt so connected to a living breathing world, where you can chat to travellers along the road help each other out with quests and knowledge and team up in such a natural and realistic fashion.
The experience is incredible, the combat feels engaging and challenging for most classes, the world while a bit bare feels so alive due to the people you meet along the way and the emphasis on cooperation and collaboration works so well with how helpful and engaged most of the community is. 
The game isn't perfect, but it gives a glimpse of what the future holds for vr multiplayer games and I honestly can't wait.
The devs are active and engaged with the community, the majority of players are either long time MMO players who've been waiting for a game like this for years, or new players who've become immersed and involved with the game. So the vast majority of the community is excited, happy to be there and help out. 
The only major issue with the game as I see it is the reliance on the community, there's not enough substance to get an enjoyable gameplay going at it solo, and there will be a point where you become blocked off from content unless you join up with other players, which as with all communitys is mostly great but with a few jerks scattered about and an early players experience with the few bad ones will likely ruin their impressions of the game.","Oct 6, 2018 at 1:49 PM",4, 5,

The feed is super choppy, killing most of the critters outside of the intro town takes a miracle, and with super basic graphics, it feels like highway robbery. I wish I read up on Oculus's return policy prior to blowing my money on this game and keeping it past 14 days. Considering how much money they're asking for, you would expect a much better game.

2022-05-28 14:09:29.572107,owen.corstens,Game of my dream,"To kick off my review I would like to tell everyone that this is the start of every gamer his dream!
****
Every gamer must have dreamt of being able to fully walk through a world and kill monsters and do stuff as if it was real. I'm glad to tell them that this game is the very beginning of making that dream come true!
***
Ive watched SAO, sword arts online, and I was so hyped about that serie because it was what I would love to be and do aswell. I was wishing for such a thing in our lifes. I bought VR especially for this kind of games!
***
Now over to my actual review... I must say that I'm impressed with the game, if you know the size of the original team and the work that has been done then I can only bow my head in respect. Though beside that I still want to highlight some working points which Ive found out after my first 20hours ingame.
***
The locomotion system is pretty good though the interaction with the surroundings and your character is on many places quite messy which forces you to use teleportation which is quite the anticlimax whenever you're in a battle or hyped up part of the game. If this only could be fixed then most ppl would probably stay only for that already. 
***
Another point is the grinding. Ofcourse teamplay will be the main thing in this game but I think solo'ing should be possible but the way the experience works it's way too hard for starters to get these levels up without doing quests which forces them to do soly quests to get the levels and even then it can be quite tricky to complete the quests. 
***
Another few things are some possible updates - like a way to locate yourself on the map, can be quite hard when you log in after a couple of days as a beginner. - when completing a quest sometimes it can be hard to figuere out where you started it and so hard to claim the reward -
***
There are many other things but these caught my attention in particular.

4stars worthy and 5stars, hopefully, incoming! gratz on this game so far!","May 16, 2018 at 8:21 PM",4, 19,

My first ever was FF3 on SNES. Orbus gives you that. Face to face action with mobs and giant bosses is amazing. The game mechanics arent set up so you hop on your first time and just kill everything. If you want that go play a game that has a easy setting. This game is as close to real as possible. Your not gonna pick up a bow in real life and be on target it takes practice but its not hard to get in game and there is always someone around to help you out. The community in game is full of ppl that want to help new players get on their way. Thats something else that make this game amazing. This game is what I thought it would be. What Ive been waiting for since I was a kid. And the good news is that it is only getting better and better with each update.,"Jun 19, 2018 at 10:16 PM",5, 13,

They've repeatedly hit every mark on projected new content (including total mechanic overhauls in addition to exciting new content) while addressing bugs/glitches/complaints/community mentality on a daily basis.

Not to mention:
Horrendous controls - cant turn with controler so dont even bother if you dont have 3 sensors, menus are impossible to navigate, moving around is annoying and interacting with anything in the game is a pain.

Terrible graphics - Iv seen roblox games with nicer looking graphics.

Forgettable and unbalanced game play- beginner mobs will kill you 70% of the time unless you use the sword. Unintresting gameplay.

2022-05-28 14:09:39.071688,gridcaster,,"Okay.  As always, keep in mind that this is an early access review.

I've been playing Orbus through the beta/alpha and now early access.  My core responses are that I love this game.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves the mmo, fantasy genrre, or loves VR. 

This is a true VR game.  It isn't a ported over MMO converted to run in VR.  The game was designed from the bottom up with all the mechanics developed to be used in a VR environment.  They have proved that this genre (VR MMO) is not only workable and possible but extremely fun.

Having said that, this game is a not a AAA mmo.  Anyone who is coming to it with  the expectation that it is going to be a big release with dozens of servers and thousands of players is totally misunderstanding the niche that this game is playing to.  To be frank, if this game were just a regular 3D MMO (as in, totally remove the VR component) then it would be mediocre to laughably bad MMO by standards of 2018,  

Make of that what you will.  It is the most addictive game in occulus that I own.  I have probably played it more than any other two games that I own combined.  If you love VR, have even a passing interest in MMOs or enjoy fantasy RPGs then this game will easily be worth the money you spend.

I've only given it 3 stars because the game itself just isn't there yet.  Too much simplicity in the classes.  There is essentially no development in play from lvl 1 to 20...the same abilities you spam at lvl 1 are the ones you'll spam at lvl 20 (they do more damage or heal for more --- but its the same ones).  Rune Mages can cast the same spells at lvl 1 as they can at max lvl (the system is based on the physical drawing of runes with the wands --- if you can draw the rune you can cast any spell in the game at lvl 1.  again, the damage scales to lvl but not the spell itself).  The lore is relatively simple --- matching the charm of the simple graphics. 

The community is genuinely kind and helpful.  5 stars there for sure.","Apr 30, 2018 at 11:29 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 14:09:39.089640,subroutine,"Fun game, needs Oculus optimization","So let's get the obvious out of the way - this is not a pretty game.  The graphics probably would have been an embarrassment on the original Wii.  That said, the graphics are at least consistent, and it comes together to create a not-bad asthetic overall.  Second, this feels like a very direct port from the HTC Vive, with controls that don't work well with the Oculus.  It's still not terrible, and you get used to them with time, but it feels like it would be a semi-easy thing to optimize closer to other Oculus games (like using the joystick to move/teleport, better button mapping, etc).  I'd be especially interested in a control scheme like The Wizards, with one joystick for teleport and the other for slide movement.  Now, all that being said, the gameplay for this is a lot of fun!  Each class certainly feels very unique, with their own learning curves and challenges.  Memorizing sword skills or runes for casting, or just learning to get the proper distance and aiming with the bow feels like a fun accomplishment.  Being able to switch between classes with separate leveling for each one works very well, much like FFXIV.  The opening quests are a little tedious and almost turned me off to the game, but stick with it and bring a friend, because there are good times to be had (and it becomes SO much easier in a group).  All in all, this one is a good bet as far as early access games go.  Though I doubt the graphics will ever improve much even in the final version, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they'll figure out better Oculus controls, and then I'm willing to up this to 5 stars.","May 8, 2018 at 12:40 PM",4, 16,

Four stars still because it's delivered a unique experience that my entire VR library hasn't captured yet...a socially organic way to play with people. I was fishing off a bridge and someone walking by started chatting with me, then they pulled out their fishing pole and we became friends. Or you find someone combatting the same monsters so you team up. If you like social experiences or the challenge of figuring things out on your own, you may like this. Better yet, if you liked early MMORPG's (like early Runescape), again this might be for you. Combine that with the fact that the developers have been pretty consistent with delivering a solid amount of updates in a timely manner and you have a fairly impressive VR MMO to dump your time into.","May 8, 2018 at 12:23 PM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 14:09:42.267986,Bru.Warden,Basic MMORPG - Cons and Pros,"Descritption: Its a basic MMORPG, nothing special. Tank, DPS, and Support. Walk around in a visually simple world and kill monsters ... and of course ... ""Fishing""!
   Cons:
1 - Very basic graphics - But in in VR you don't need impressive graphics. Simpler is better.
2 - Solo play - Not meant for this, it gets boring. Game was not designed for this.
3 - Warrior combos - Spamming combos is what you do. Repetitious and will make your shoulders hurt. In combat you can hear the warrior pant. Game needs to abandon Combos and try something else.
4 - Lack of in game feedback. Not sure if combo works or if you have been hit. Attacks from behind go unnoticed until too late.
5 - Lack on instructions - You got to figure much of it yourself - In an MMO, asking is solves a lot, so don't be shy.
6 - Mage - I drew the glyph exactly as shown to no affect, but a mashed up version works. Game needs improvements here.
7 - Bugs - Voice thing stops working, can't walk through place, but teleport works, etc (Its an alpha build).
   Pros:
1 - Its an MMORPG - Even if you don't like this specific one, supporting it encourages more to be made.
2 - MMO - This is a Pro /Con depending who you meet, but once you find your ""Group"", its great.
3 - Not spoon fed, its ""Old School"" - Your map does not show where you are. You need to solve and figure things out on your own (or ask other players). Its about exploring and working together.
4 - Alpha - Its developing and improving. Devs take feedback and are working hard. Ran into a Dev cahracter in game and chatted with him (friendly and informative).
   Conclusion: The Con list may seem long and the Pro list weak; but its interesting and fun when playing with others. Curently, as/is its a 2/3 star, but with Alpha development, its looking like a 4+ game. Did I mention its an MMORPG?","Apr 24, 2018 at 10:19 AM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 14:09:42.285937,RogueSlayer,Mage class needs work,"The mage class in this game can be one of the coolest experience, however it needs some work to make it where it should be. The spell detection, as mentioned by others too, not working well. it doesn't work majority of the time no matter how accurately you cast them.

The game has alot of potential. Hence why I didn't refund it. But the devs really need to work on core elements of the game such as the classes before rolling out new things which might complicate things even further.

Another problem I would say is the lack of animation in combat. When you hit a monster, it really should have some form of reaction animation. Please add some animation to them as it can add tons of immersion into the game.","Apr 12, 2018 at 6:41 AM",2, 18,
2022-05-28 14:09:42.303889,LuridFTW,A simple and shallow game.,"OrbusVR just isn’t what we want out of an MMORPG game yet. While it’s still in Alpha and does offer a lot of features that MMORPG games do, it’s very simplistic and shallow without much customization. There is still a lot more they need to add and change to justify this $40 price tag. Class skills are given to you from the start, for example archers receive a handful of special arrows which they can equip 2 of at a time. As you level up you never unlock new skills/arrows, you just keep using the same handful throughout. This makes for very boring and repetitive combat. Runemages need to have a complete rework on how skills are handled and casted, or a much higher leniency when trying to draw a pattern otherwise you'll never cast consistently. You do not acquire skill points, and items do not have varying stats. For what it offers and the steep price tag you can’t possibly say this is more than 3 stars. I think people forget that 5 stars means perfect, which this game is not, as I said earlier it’s very simplistic and shallow and missing a lot.

So if you are intrested here are some pros and cons so you can decide for yourself ;)
PROS:
-Easy controls, and alot of options to change it to your liking.
-Lots of people, so there is always somebody to help you
-Cool combat, especially the runemage, where you have to draw your spells in the air to cast them, and you have to search all over the world to find new spells on stones.( you can also learn them from other people in the game)
-Big world(dont get on the airship unless you want to get lost XD)
-Very good crafting system
-All four classes are balanced and have their own cool mechanics to learn
-Everything you want from a basic mmo, grinding, leveling, party's, trading, markets.
CONS:
-The game has a very specific art style, you love it or hate it( doesn't take away from the emersion, exept the sheep, those look hilarious XD
-Not a very big tutoriol and you often have to find out what to do on your own, you can get lost quick.
-The runemage is aloooot of fun, but it can be frustrating to learn some of the spells, people that get angry quick might want to stay away from that class.
-It can get buggy and sometimes there are some lagg spikes, but it is still in development so that is to be expected.

I personally love this game, its like a kids dream come true. and i love the runemage. practicing spells for hours with other people is really a blast. I hope this review was usefull for some of you and sorry for any typo's :p","Mar 18, 2018 at 4:58 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:09:51.789460,GameAdam28,Version 4.8,"I have played this game over 100 hours. I have a level 10 Musketeer and level 15 Ranger. It is in early access so there are some bugs and incomplete things about the game, hence 4 stars instead of 5. That said this is the best VR game I have played in terms of gameplay. I don't regret paying $39.99 for this game. My favorite MMO was Final Fantasy 11 and I haven't enjoyed a game since then as much as I am enjoying this one. Runemage (DPS & Support) was hard at first so I quit for a while but came back to it and started mastering the spells, now I do so much damage those redtails can't touch me (level 2). Musketeer (Healer) was hard at first until I learned how to use the orbs in a rotation that worked. Killing things is a little slow but its a very survivable class. Later on it is impossible to kill healer mobs by yourself at around the same level as you. Ranger (DPS) is now my favorite class. It doesn't do as much DPS as a mage but it is more forgiving and I can usually kill things that are higher level than me (red mark). I haven't spent too much time playing warrior (tank) because I play sitting down in a swivel chair and I have a very small 5 x 5 space where my desk is. Warrior is a very demanding class albeit fun from what I did play of it. I will move my setup so that I can play it more at some point. Talent systems have added character progression in this version that didn't previously exist. 

In short this game is in early access, so if you buy it expect to be dealing with some bugs and minor nuissances. If you love mmorpg games though, there currently is no other game like this one.","Mar 26, 2018 at 7:36 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:09:51.809406,DeviliveD666,Give it a try!,Well first time I started the game I thought ffs what is that cheap style... But I gave it a try and you will feel the more you play orbus the better it looks and the beetter the immersion gets. But put the graphics to at least high or it looks cheap and kills the athmosphere;) It reminds me a bit of kal online which was the first mmorpg I ever played and I think it was one of the first ones (long time before WOW). I'm new to the game and main archer for now and it's really fun to play as archery is one of the best immersive things to do in VR so far imo. Today I was invited to a party for a harder beginner quest that is not doable solo and it's such a big difference to desktop games as you really manage this by walking to someone and asking if he / she wants to do the quest with you (so no clicks and chats and more like real life). Another point to mention is the locomotion system. I have chosen the option to move in the direction of my controller and it's really nice and smooth! In games like from other suns or the new locomotion implemented in Rec Room (move where you look / move independent to sight / controlelrs) it doesn't make me motion sick. Another amazing part is that your quests are written down in a diary and you have to coordinate by a compass and a map (the map is also in the diary). It feels like Morrowind and I missed it so much as you don't have the big bright arrow over your head making you rush from objective to objective without using it (your head). The crafting system is a ... let's say revolution in crafting systems in MMORPGs as you pick the ingredients from a table that is stocked with stuff you deposit in the appropriate chest that is standing beside. Especially alchemy  is whole new feeling in MMORPG crafting as you have the recieps written down in your diary and have to put the ingredients in the pot in the right direction and at the right moment (depends on the temperature that is displayed by the colour of the liquid).,"Mar 19, 2018 at 7:20 AM",5, 11,

The graphics are meh (why Unity, why not UE4?) and there are a lot of bugs and glitches, but the game mechanics and player interaction are very solid. Questing is fun, while there could be more quests, if you ask me, but it is an early access game. 

This game is the 100% proof that there will be a great VRMMORPG in the future! I played a few nights now and I mean nights from like 22PM to 8AM (this is when my US buddies are online, I'm from germany). It is absolutely addictive when you interact with players. Also becomming a decent rune mage or any other class is a real challenge (rune mage is hardest).

I seriously hope somebody at blizzard tried this game and saw we need WoW VR. 5-10 Blizzard devs and artists can hack together something awesome with their 3D Model database in just a year and everybody will play it night and day I promise. 

Downside is I just came away from my WoW addiction like 8 Years ago and now I know the first real good (not Orbus, but it is a good start) VRMMORPG will kill me xD

2022-05-28 14:09:54.936658,Bobukanator,,"Being a part of a game like this reminds me of the good old days when I started playing text-based MUDs. At the time, there was no internet but once you found a BBS with enough nodes to host multiple people the experience was fantastic. Then came Diablo and LAN parties and finally when WOW came out, I really had to figure out how to have self-control so I could continue to level up in real life. 

This game brings back those early feelings. Adding the virtual layer on top of an MMORPG is terrific! The community has been helpful, and the development team is entirely involved and responsive. I am thrilled that my investment in my Oculus has finally paid off. 

If you can relate to the good old days I have described, you have no choice but to try this game. Just a warning that some self-control is necessary if you want to continue leveling up in the real world.","Feb 4, 2018 at 10:17 PM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 14:09:54.954610,Ahnzoog,"Great Community, and great mechanics","I've played lots of MMOs and this definitely reminds me of the start of many MMOs out there... like Everquest and to an extent WoW in its early days.  It's not super easy and feels rewarding as you get the hang of what each class can do. Runemage is locked behind a quest, which is good, because if it was your very first try, you'd probably give up in frustration... just know it's the highest damage in the game once you get the hang of it... but it takes a lot of practice to master it. I think there are about 20 spells. I'm proficient in all but 1. you switch classes by switching weapons. so 1 character can play all 4 classes.   I love this game and the developers are VERY good with their open communcation on their forums.  I'm sure that anyone that joins will find lots of people willing to help them out and show them the ropes.","Jan 24, 2018 at 3:37 AM",4, 36,
2022-05-28 14:09:54.972562,Signor_Issor,Hope to see much more,"Update 13.03.18:
I am now level 14 (of 20) mage with knowldege but sometimes no skill of my casts :-)
There are quests to do in game to get to this level but not enough. But I read that there will be more coming so future people may find it easier. So I spent several hours in killing Mobs. It made more fun while i was in a group.
To my surprise the story of the game really started at around level 8 ... there were some news coming which I was not expecting. So now I want to see more and get deeper into this story.
I also made the first dungeon which was an interesting experience. If the Tank always jumps in front of the Mob and your cast goes into the Tanks back. You need to find a good position.

It still makes fun playing this game. Not comparable with WoW or other games like this but a good first VR MMORPG.

Old review content:
I play various MMORPGs and you can not compare this game to big developer studios games. But as a first start i really like it and hope to see more in future. I think the price of 40 Euro is high (compared to other VR games) but I also see it as an invest in the future (and i know that developing software costs some money).

I needed 3 Chars to get all information from the beginning as i sometimes was too fast and not willing to read. But to be fair most of the information you need to start is explained in basic tutorials. And in case you search for information I can say that the WIKI is helpful.
The game itself has limited graphics andgameplay but still makes fun after several hours. I really like to act as the character e.g. you need to dig if you want to harvest some herbs.
The game itself was stable for my computer but I am running a High-end PC with High-end graphics and lots of memory:
- i7-7700k CPU at 4.2 GHz
- 32 GB

2022-05-28 14:09:54.991511,Vaeloron,Great potential!!,For where they are at in development I think they deserve 5 stars.  There are some things that I think need to be done better but I can't complain at this point.  VR is not taking off the way it was hoped it would however games like this have the potential to make it happen if they can keep polishing it.  The interactive combat systems are excellent.  You will hear many people complain about the spell casting system but I love it.   A runemage can do a lot of damage if you take the time to practice the spells and remain calm when you are casting regardless of the incoming attacks and you have to remember that you are casting your runes in a 3D world and not 2D so if a spell is flat cast it flat and if it is a 3d spell cast it in 3D.

As for combat, it's extremely hard to run away, if you play a warrior it basically forces you to sit next to mob and swing until either you or the enemy dies, there's no real tactics to it other than memorizing combos, which don't always seem to execute if your timing is slightly off. If your fighting and another mob wonders over to you, forget about it you're dead. The magic is teribly imprecise as well, some spells I can cast, but apparently I can't even draw a simple ""M"" to cast a spell, which happens also to be the first letter of my name.

This is not like World of Warcraft, but it has a sense of discovery, exploration, community and unique combat styles that have inspired me to play as much as possible. There are so many improvements the game can use but it is proof that VRMMORPGs will be immensely successful when the technology becomes more affordable.","Jan 27, 2018 at 11:46 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 14:09:58.167150,Arvomus,,"If VR wasn't a component this would esentially be ""babbies first MMO"". Wich isn't necesarily a bad thing since you gota keep it relatively simple for a first attempt. It has some unique ideas though that only work in VR. Spellcasting is very interesting because you have to wave the wand in specific paterns to cast different spells. Archer and musketeer are as expected and fun with VR.

Where I think things need dramatic work is melee. Part of this is a problem I have with most VR games, and thats there is very little feeling you're actually connecting when you swing a weapon (and trying to remember the combos in this is absurd). Another problem would be movement. This game uses the standard design of point and click movement or use the analog stick for incredably fast and jenkey movement. They also use this bizzare system of you moving in the direction of where you hands are pointed rather then the direction of the sticks. Range classes I don't feel are effected as much by this. But in any game melee is dependant on movement. Untill they can work out a better system, this class is very boring, or frustrating.

Overall this is still worth a try for the sake of its potential. Either the potential of this specific game or of future games like it. 

Side note, it would be nice to have an in game option to adjust perspective if you're sitting. Most people don't want to play a MMO for a few hours at a time standing.","Feb 24, 2018 at 1:03 PM",3, 12,

Level progression, loot, gear, crafting, etc. I've spent more time in this game in the last 3 days than I have any other game in the 6 months I've owned the oculus. This is seriously addictive and fun! It does seem to lack a little polish, but it makes up for it with available playtime, classes, quests, online presense, etc.

It's very tempting to skip past a lot of the text when you first start... don't! Read it all the way through - the game is confusing enough and lacks direction a lot of the time, so if you don't pay attention, you miss things pretty easily. 

BE ADVISED: I'm not sure if this will happen for everyone, but I couldn't move or do anything in the world without first configuring the controls (something the game doesn't tell you anything about until you open up the settings). 

Very worth it, very fun, lots of positive, supportive, helpful players online ALWAYS.

2022-05-28 14:10:04.495445,OoaliceoO,Simply Awesome,"YES unlike other games Orbus is not learnt in an hour, or even several, practice is everything. That said it got everything an MMORPG needs and is really not that hard. Some classes (like musketeer) are so easy they don't really allow to die if you quest in areas which fit your level. As in any other RPG, use your abilities (orbs) correctly, specially the shield one and the turret set to healing NOT dmg. Easy to pass through all the mobs, solo, quickly. Ranger isn't much harder, this one does a ton of dmg, I'd perhaps watch some videos first to get a grip. Now the mage class is hardest and hidden behind a rock and quests for a reason(!), this one I would not even try before leveling another class at least to level 5 or 6 first. Then again it is about figuring the most effective order of spells, and practice. The warrior is kind of exhausting, I chose the girly-class (healer/musketeer) which I like most so far and well, i'm just not sportive enough to play the others more than 1-2 hours in a row :). The biggest advantage: Most VR games are cool, but either content is done in few hours or shorter or they get boring. Orbus will keep you goin for 100+ hours I'm sure, once you got the hang of it. Graphics are rather simple yet I prefer a stable server featuring multiplayer over a fancy bells-n-whistles game which crashes all the time.

yes i know this is early accsess and i will change my review when it gets updated and issues resolved

suggestions:
more forgiving with the runemages spells.

add a msg opption (like a chat bubble for people who cant use and/or dont have a mic.

a 2nd way to interact with an npc incase of glitch or lag.

a page in the journal to show that tell u where u get the ingregents from or show it on the map

more space in some area between moster spawns and where some people walk (near the noob town heading to the witchs cave or harvesting the reedflute in that area kept getting killed by much higher lv crabs then i could even chip away hp on)

a basic attack for mage (even if very low dmg, i have died with the monster on a few pixles of hp left and didnt have time to cast even a lv1 fireball or frost)

thats all for now","Jan 30, 2018 at 4:05 PM",4, 4,

Every gaming skill you do requires your hands. There are no hotkeys. 

The gameplay/combat is amazing. The game does NOT hold your hand. You have to figure stuff out, read, and investigate.

If you want a true skill based vrmmo, this is your game. If you want all the answers spoon fed to you, then you'll hate it.","Dec 16, 2017 at 6:12 PM",5, 11,

I have been invovled since alpha and have met some wonderful and helpful people who make up the great community of orbus. 

You can PvE, PvP and create your own backstory to roleplay in this immersive environment. 

Come on in and join in the fun. The first of its kind for a virtual reality experience. Support the developers and they will continue to improve and build upon this concept. The core mechanics set the base for future workable VR MMOs.","Dec 16, 2017 at 1:10 AM",5, 10,
