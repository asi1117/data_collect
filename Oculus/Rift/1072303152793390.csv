2022-05-28 16:33:19.820202,AussieGuy92,Altspace has perks over other platforms,"You can build worlds really easily using the built in world editor. Most of the functionality of managing worlds is done through the AltspaceVR website and you can join public groups to grow your asset collection and obtain new worlds to call your own. There are plenty of events around the clock but mostly during peak times, these events are different to other apps. What makes AltspaceVR great is the merge of world building and events. You can have your own private worlds or make them public. You can also grant flight and other building permissions to get others to help you. If you are into Unity3D you can use the uploader tool to upload your own world. If you want to implement user functions you can use the MRE SDK to code apps that can extend your ideas.

The platform isn't perfect but for an adult social VR app this app is often considered a hidden gem. Before joining, just be sure to toggle your Early access program and Worlds Beta in your menu. This will allow you to see user-generated worlds and this isn't toggled on by default and a key reason why people skip this app.

There are reviews regarding issues with this platform, Altspace has improved a mile with their accessibility and fixing most glitches. This platform isn't perfect but if you give it time it will weirdly grow on you. It has done some things that other platforms haven't done well and deserves a chance.",Mar 31 at 9:36 PM,5, 2,

I met so many cool people on Altspace since I first joined back in March 2021 and attended all types of events: clubs, birthday parties, holiday concerts, arena sessions, karaoke nights, bridal showers, church, shopping malls, etc. The avatars are the best I've seen compared to the other social apps. The Altspace developers are constantly updating the app making our VR experience even greater. There are amazing world and kit builders on here and some of the places I've seen are breathtaking. This is not the app for kids though--this is a grown up experience and it's so worth it. I love my Altspace family! #ChrisChris",Jan 16 at 11:59 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:33:19.879044,martin.renew,My number 1 VR place (Rift CV1),"I've made friends & worlds. After 2 years, still makes me go wow. I sometimes think I've seen it all then find the best world ever - again. The beauty of worlds brings tears to my eyes. I've been part of a group that made a film. I've met people from over 20 countries & learnt all sorts of things from the people I've met. There are interesting events on many subjects. You can do events yourself. I've been clubbing. When real church was in lockdown, I was able to go to VRchurch. I've spoken to some Italians, thanks to the translation feature in some worlds/events. People make me laugh with what they create. Some worlds don't just amaze me from a technical point of view but leave me wondering how on earth they came up with the idea for the design in the 1st place. There are opportunities to make money but there's no need to spend money if you can't or won't. Seen 3D worlds, pictures & films. You can take photos & look back on good memories with friends. Almost everyone wants to be your friend. No annoying kids like RecRoom. I've been to talks about things I wasn't interested in, only to find they were interesting. Art galleries not only made me go wow but the gallery itself was a work of art, & you can fly around & get another angle on things. Been able to get access to people with degrees in lots of subjects & learn from them - people you'd normally never get to talk to & they're so helpful. Been able to help others. I heard a frustrated world builder say, ""You can't do that in Altspace"" & was able to take him to a world where it was done & introduce him to the builder who taught him how. I heard another say, ""When someone says, ""You can't do that in Altspace"", she responds with, ""Challenge accepted"". Even with problems, I know there are people working on solutions. Even after listing all these reasons for liking Altspace, I'm sure I'll think of more later. Thanks to eveyone for making it what it is.",Nov 11 at 6:43 PM,5, 8,

2022-05-28 16:33:23.046573,kriszvandaar,For quest it's actually 5 stars but...,"Maybe I'm wrong and I'm doing something not good but this app was one of the first that I started to use 5 years ago on Rift. It was really amazing, as I could set my own environment with an online player, where I could make my own parties. I used YouTube, and it worked so well! Now I returned back into the world of alt space with the quest, and I found it amazing. The places are smaller, but the characters look much more better. I tried to make my own home place again the same with music etc, but I couldn't. Some people told me that it was still possible, it just more complicated now... Okay, I thought that I just had to connect to my pc, to get the well used beautiful environment and the very useful features but whatever I tried it didn't work anymore. The graphics looks cool on quest, but to see the rift's version, I have to realise that it downgraded like hell. Again: it was much more beautiful 5 years ago, and it was a lot more easier to use YouTube videoplayer. To see those back steps made me extremely disappointed, and I really can't understand the reasons. 5 years ago, I used a geforce gtx 970 gpu, and I had no issues at all. Now I have an rtx3070 with I7 CPU with 2xmore RAM, and it has performance issues as hell, and yet the app became 20times more ugly! How is that possible?? I'm really sad to see that, something that was amazing became just a little funny thing. And it's free, so quest users going to enjoy it a lot, and I suggest to get it, but as a Rift user, it feels like it has lost its superpower, that I find very sad thing...","Mar 15, 2021 at 6:20 AM",3, 13,

I had high hopes because clearly they have money backing because they're owned by Microsoft, but the app feels ""stuck"". Nothing meaningful ever seems to change. It feels like (and not saying it's the case - but it FEELS like) the app has been abandonded by the developers. Apart from that they MUST change their advertising. All the banners and front page picture do NOT match what you're seeing in the app. I'm woefully reminded of what it felt to get your first sea monkeys thinking that they'll look at least similar to the pictures of the advertisements. AltspaceVR looks NOTHING like the banners would suggest. The Avatar graphics look like you're using an alpha build of an app and the graphics have not changed since 2018. My advice to the developers: pull this app into the 21st century, overhaul the graphics, spend some money on content, stop fixing things under the hood where we can't see it and make it obvious you're working on this.","Nov 3, 2020 at 10:55 PM",2, 32,

Now... with the removal of the web browser from Windows VR, you have Quest users vs Rift/Vive/Index. PC users typically have to rely on buggy Multimedia Consoles made by the staff or higher-ups, whereas Quest can still enjoy the classic player that worked very well. Also, due to this, all but HAH games are gone. Sure, you can make a world easily, but without even basic entertainment, it's become nothing more than a meet-n-greet. I would not recommend this unless you are a Quest User, and can use the classic players.","Sep 12, 2020 at 10:33 AM",1, 7,"Hi Shilar, thanks for the feedback.

We removed the web browser from PC/PCVR due to security changes that needed to be made. Using the Multimedia Console, you can display images and play videos from YouTube, Twitch, etc.

Removed stuff over the years.

#Arm and leg tracking
#Leapmotion support
#A decent back end SDK to develop on
#The best user created world editor *Shanes Editor* (replaced by a Chinese knockoff)
#Realistic spacial audio
#2D android support
#The most wildly used and loved avatar robots removed completely
#Soon to be gone, GearVR and Go support, as you don't know how to scale rendering
#The legacy movement and grab mechanics
#Marshmallows you can roast in the campfire
#Loads more other things too, but i'll say no more.

They have moderators in there at almost all times, but if you're getting harassed then the moderators will do nothing about it and they'll also go out of their way to protect pedophiles that abduct and groom children. You read that right, there's already been one instance where a child has been abducted by someone they met on this app and they refused to help out in the investigation.

2022-05-28 16:33:32.458399,GoodMew,Unsafe Space,"I've been playing AltSpace for over a year, very often. It was a great cross-platform app for socializing, games, and creativity. Surprisingly, they managed to keep the community wholesome, friendly, safe, and comfortable. But with recent updates, they destroyed this app. With the new avatar update, the tone of the community is rapidly changing. They took away ""our"" safe space, to create ""their"" safe space. For example, I wanted to be neutral, so I was a robot avatar. Now they force me to be a human, and I can't even select my gender anymore. I can't be myself. Sad to say, I'm uninstalling this app, along with many other content creators.","Jul 17, 2020 at 3:07 AM",1, 14,

2022-05-28 16:33:32.519236,LuckyNZ,My experience was bad.,"My experience with this app goes as follows
Installed the app because I am interested in an ADHD seminar held the next day.
Next day I open the app for the first time and do the tutorial. It's fine so far but doesn't explain menus.
After tutorial i'm sent to a room (hub world maybe?) with other people in it... omg already? I'm a very shy person so this is kind of jarring. Oh well.
I walk around a bit by myself and hear a couple of young kids SCREAMING into their mics. Sounds terrible. But ok, it's a free app so it's a pretty common problem. 
I decide to sit on a chair (for immersion) and figure out the menus. I mute my own mic because I don't know how I feel about the app yet.
After about 2 mins of literally sitting there and figuring out how to join the ADHD event I was there to join I had to make an account before I'm allowed to enter. 
Started to make an account.
Person walks up to me.
Screen goes dark...
Message: You have been kicked for microphone abuse.

Mod kicked me. Missed seminar.","May 4, 2020 at 7:37 AM",2, 26,"Hey LuckyNZ. Thanks for the feedback here.

The beautiful view of Campfire, the best place to hangout - if your microphone is mute otherwise you will get ban. (unless you suck up to the Moderators)

Be completely socially connected in a virtual space - with underage children and Admins. (unless you make a private space and invite your own friends)

Let your creativity kick in from VR world editor, take your experience to a whole new level - only if you like looking at lowpoly objects (limited 200<) Controls are a pain in the backside and it crashes if you upload more than 5 pictures. (unless you let Altspace tell you what you should build)

A powerful event section full of exciting places - that kids come together and  harassing eachother (unless you want to Meditate with Jeremy)

Sadly there is no possibility to upload our own textures and mesh objects for avatars - in that regard  I prefer VRChat, Sansar and NeosVR.

Someone kept kicking a kid from our game and for no reason whatsoever the kid thought it was me even though it wasn't. I assume the kid must have then reported me to a mod as I ended up getting kicked and barred from the server. They need to something about it as you could tell that everyone feels on edge all the time worrying they will get banned etc. The community and general game are good though, like a more close knit version of VRChat  (albeit very quiet, there are barely 50 people online most times I go on)","Nov 26, 2019 at 11:52 PM",3, 31,"Hey NemoNine88!

I have had no problems and find them both helpful and friendly and always ready to assist.

The world building is one of the most confusing things. What I think is intuitive: a palite menu with some defualt objects e.g. a cube, a plane, a cone, a spot light and a plus button at the top to import your own. Seperate to a details pannel that shows the options for the object selected. You should also be able to push the selected object away with the joystick (similar to oculus home).","Jan 7, 2020 at 3:21 AM",5, 2,"Hi I_Electron_I. Thanks for the great feedback.

2022-05-28 16:33:48.319976,cybernettr,,"I like the “events“ option. If you’re not interested in “socializing“ with strangers, attending an event is a nice alternative. The tutorial was good and useful. The interface seems logical and well laid out. It has a lot of user created worlds, but finding a particular world of interest is not easy. The thumbnails don’t give a good idea of what a world looks like, and it doesn’t remember the place you left off last time, meaning there’s a lot of scrolling. I was trying to find the Halloween environment that drew my attention to the app in the first place but wasnt able to. Finally, the app seem to lose track of my hands a lot. Granted, I was sitting, but my left hand kept flying off to the right of me. I went into the Sensor Bounds app afterwards and admittedly, my left hand did go out of bounds when resting on the arm of my chair but it still did a better job of remembering and tracking where it was.","Nov 2, 2019 at 10:28 AM",3, 0,"Hi cybernettr!

I was pleasantly surprised.  Again, I'm not really very ""social"" and I know that's what the whole point of this app is, but I can still get something out of it by attending events, casually running into others and saying ""Hey"", and basically observing how others interact with each other.
I would love for there to be more events since that's really what I get out of Altspace the most.  So I'll keep coming back to see what events are coming up.
Oh, and by the way: That's an AWESOME option to be able to see what events are coming up.  For someone like me who's really mostly interested in events, I don't want to have to go into VR to find out what's coming up.  Getting on the web and/or getting email notices about upcoming events is an extremely valuable feature.

2022-05-28 16:33:48.383804,corprinus,The best VR social app. Period.,"Wow...I'm writing this review after my first night in AltSpace and it will be one that I will never forget...in real life or virtual. AltSpace has proven that virtual experiences can be just as good or better than real life when it comes to the social space. For about 4 hours I was literally in another world, I started the night off by attending an open mic session which was jam packed with people doing music and comedy while the crowd gave much love to each and every person who got on stage. I made a friend after the show and we talked out in the lobby for a few minutes just to realize that we were the only ones still in the building. We agreed to go to the campgrounds and see what was happening there. We saw several groups of people but then proceeded to this particular group near a fence. For the next 3 hours, we played trivia games that was hosted by a single individual like a game show and I have never seen anything so naturally happen in video games. The whole night was just like going out on the town in real life, you don't know what will happen and who you will meet. This app has repaired my social life to a point where I would rather meet and hang out with people in AltSpace instead of doing it in real life....it's that good of a VR app. Don't know where any negative reviews are coming from but this game is super mature, accurate with making you feel like you're really hanging out with people, visually appealing and downright fun. Get this app now.","Oct 10, 2019 at 3:50 PM",5, 4,"Hi corprinus! Wow, it sounds like you've really been getting the FULL AltspaceVR experience.

2022-05-28 16:33:54.651041,Gecko-VR,A more mature and civil social game.,"I have four main social games that I play: Rec Room, VR Chat, Bigscreen, and AltSpace. AltSpace has by far the most mature audience and players. You can get away from most of the children under the age of 13 in this game. You can find people of all ages up to 60 that I've seen. You'll join in a world and find people talking with each other and you can just walk right up and join in the conversation. 

This game also features events that people can host and schedule such as weight loss discussion, meditation, and even an LGBTQ+ community room. The avatars aren't too annoying and pretty basic yet unique. I also love that this game supports the Oculus Go and Gear VR so you can talk with people using all different tiers of headsets.

I really appreciate this game for what it is, and I think most people will to.

2022-05-28 16:33:54.682956,Hanover,"You've Come a Long Way, Baby","I've been an AltSpace member since it started.  During it's early days, many of us who were early adopters of VR felt like we were pioneers as we walked through the spaces and played endless rounds of Cards Against Humanity while listening to music.  Unfortunately many of us dropped off and lost touch. 

I hadn't been on it in almost a year and what a nice surprise to see how much AltSpace has evolved since those early days.  The experience is more streamlined and they now make it easier to customize your space without having to learn their ThreeJS-based API. There is a lot of creativity afoot now and tons of new spaces to explore...even Cards Against Humanity (now known as Cards Against Reality) has been given a facelift.

If you want a relatively friendly space to hang out in VR, I would definitely recommend AltSpace VR.","Feb 17, 2019 at 12:46 PM",4, 10,"Hanover, thank you!

2022-05-28 16:33:57.788649,VeryCreativeName,The most average Social Game.,"In my experience AltSpace VR has been what I can only describe as a very... okay experience. The game works fine, the controls are solid, a decent few items are interactable and private worlds allow for some party games or cool effects. And because this game features on mobile and standalone theres alot of opportunity to meet a more diverse crowd of people than you would in other games. Where this game falls flat though is there is almost zero room to be unique or give yourself individuality. Alot of the unique props and avatars have long since been purged from the game so most players look the same. This means that any interaction you have is soley based on your charisma and nothing to do with your creativity. Even the party games mentioned before suffer due to this as they are all only avaliable in private or hosted worlds which means you can get kicked before you even load in or not even allowed to play because a majority of the participants have to vote you in.
In short, if you like talking to people and meeting new people this game is fantastic but if you're the kind who wants something to do with you newfound friends theres better alternatives out there.","Jan 23, 2019 at 5:44 AM",3, 0,"Hi VeryCreativeName, thanks for the feedback!

User interface is clean & crispy. Tutorial quick & comprehensive. Was excited. Went to the campfire & see a bunch of dudes huddled around some chick singing the shape of you. She had a nice & generic disney channel voice .  I cried from the back of the crowd ""GaaYY!"" with 
comedic intentions. Turns out she didn't like it so shhe lectured me on the ""community guidlines for lude & unwanted behavior""  & blocked me out of my account.

To the development team: Hello, AltSpace development team. I read through the comments and saw that my issue is shared by others. I wish you guys the best in fixing it, and I look forward to hop back on when it is fixed.
Incase it helps in any way, my experience with it is this: I oppened the app. It got all the way to the loading screen and went black with the hourglass. It caused my entire PC to freeze up. Sorry if it doesn't help much.","Jun 4, 2018 at 9:03 PM",5, 4,"Allo ZaneKata, thanks for the feedback.

2022-05-28 16:34:19.920455,YiKwang,Holding the VR Front on Every Side,"There are no 2 ways about it, Altspace is the pinnacle of VR Sociality. Some networks offer you greater personal customisation, but invariably come with greatly reduced connectivity. Some provide a greater focus on games, mini- or otherwise, but often come with less developed social personalities amongst their communities. Altspace VR offers a wide variety of experiences, games, social settings, community outlets and development opportunities, without pushing the system so much that it is as unreliable as other apps. Overall I find Altspace to be the perfect place for the present era of VR technology and functionality, a place that is always growing and filled with rich and creative citizens. PS: It's also very easy to avoid and/or remove yourself from the kind of moronic, adversarial children that often swarm social networks, definately not the least important reason on my list...","Jan 18, 2018 at 12:18 AM",5, 1,"Allo YiKwang, thanks for the feedback.

I hate to say it because this would have SO MUCH potential, but you're essentially playing a ""phone app"" on your $700 Oculus (or Vive for that matter) which imho is a joke. I do understand however that currently  most people are checking out VR on mobile devices and that a social VR platform right now cannot just ignore the mainstream users. If you're fine with low poly, very limited avatar choices and simply want to chat with people I guess it's ""ok"", simply because it's the VR app with the most people right now.

When you try to log in, a virtual keyboard pops up, but this keyboard intersects with other UI elements which makes it impossible to actually hit all the possible keys.  In order to log in, the only way is to use an actual keyboard, but if you take off your headset to do this it becomes impossible to log in because your headset is no longer ""looking"" at the menu so you can't see it on your screen.  At times parts of the menu system simply stop loading (I had this happen several times with the window where you are supposed to be able to customize your avatar) and your only choice is to quit the app and reload to get working menus.  Using the actual ""quit"" button in the menu doesn't quit the app, it simply crashes it so you are left with a black screen and the only way to get back to Oculus Home is to take off your headset, and kill the app in Windows.  When trying to grab objects (like glowsticks and torches in the various rooms) the detection radius for grabbing is incredibly small which makes it super awkward to interact with anything (if your controller is not in the perfect position, it simply won't register despite my characters hand model intersecting with the object I'm trying to grab).  Many apps and games in the Oculus store are incredibly polished and have a great UX. This is not one of them.","Dec 22, 2016 at 3:36 PM",1, 7,

I've never seen so many people on so many different VR devices hang out in one spot. I've met a ton of cool people and seen some big stars right in VR. 

Hands down most hours spent in VR to date in this app.","Nov 14, 2016 at 3:07 AM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 16:34:48.398287,Epoxian,Not very polished,"There are characters with four hands at the moment. A while ago they had a talk about how much love they put into creation of their character models. Seriously? I wanted to participate on two live events (which are at 4 AM for me), one was delayed by half an hour and the other one was delayed by an hour and then canceled without futher information. This needs much more love. I fear this is a typical unfinished unity prototype, which will never be really bug-free.","Dec 30, 2016 at 8:54 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 16:34:48.416239,Welby,Cool but not beatiful,"Altspace VR is probably one of the best social VR platform you can have right now. Lot of different places and people to meet,tons of devices supported with motion controllers as well.

My only complain is on the artistic side. With such a wide and well-done VR support they could have took a better approach/quality to the visuals. The avatars are too often with some bad textures quality and even the choice of them sometimes are just not well fit in VR. Too much weird avatars and isn't always so simple to interact with other people when the avatar is so weird you can't even understand where they're looking.

The overall quality of the places and look/feel should also go a lot higher to meet the standards that the application has in other fields. The lights are often dull,the 3D assets too much low-poly especially for PC. It looks like they just made few amateurish scenarios in Unity just to be ready as quick as possible but i think it's now time to improve a lot this aspect.

I'd rather prefer 1/2 well/high-quality scenario instead of tons of low-quality ones.","Nov 16, 2016 at 5:51 PM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 16:34:48.432196,Shallowkal,Good but Rec Rooms is better,Deleting until they stop pushing updates through because its getting annoying. Save your updates and push them through as a proper patch rather than daily.

Watch YT or netflix, play some (simple) games or share your web browser with friends. If you know java and html and want to go a step further donload the SDK and build your own Room.
A nice mancave or the model of a molecule,
maybe. The choice is yours.
Oh and one last thing, I love the (experimental) Kinect support. Feels so wierd to use my real arms in VR... �","Nov 25, 2016 at 11:26 PM",5, 6,
