2022-05-28 18:23:21.624769,MegaFlops,Nice!,Interesting puzzles & nice graphics. I got it on sale for a few bucks and it fullfilled my expectations. Just hop in and play a few cubes ...,"Dec 2, 2020 at 4:50 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:23:21.639728,Deeperbeige,"Good ideas, flawed implementation","Wonderful puzzle ideas, but I've experienced 2x off-by-one errors in the first 10 levels that forced me to restart the game, as it put me outside the arena.

The presentation could use some work too. It's all so gloomy, and there's nothing to distinguish the cardinal directions. I'd have liked to have seen different colours for the 6 sides of the arena, much like Manifold Garden does, perhaps as glowing lines between the floor tiles.

Anyway, props for trying something different in VR!","May 24, 2020 at 5:19 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:23:21.655686,FknNuts,Wow. I love it!!!,"I've had this game for a while. But yesterday was the first time that I played it. I was amazed at how well made it is. It's genius.
Yes I played it with just one button (X). You can physically turn in the direction you want to go and press X; or simply look in the chosen direction and press X.
Thank you to those who made it.","Jun 11, 2020 at 3:34 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:23:21.670646,Cesare.DellaNoce,,"Having problems with Oculus touch controllers, only one button work, and it seems that you hadn't answer any of us who have the same problem, that's not a serious actitude, not a serious developer","Sep 11, 2019 at 10:02 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 18:23:24.778334,Lalle75,Touch controllers nearly not possible,"The touch controllers are reduced to the buttons X and menu. Rotating is not possible. Unplayable for me.
Until it's fixed, I won't raise the amount of stars.","Aug 13, 2019 at 10:44 PM",1, 7,

2022-05-28 18:23:24.808254,I-M_BlackShaddow,Ouch! Was that a Crate?,"Using only the Touch controllers, I related (eventualy) to what was going on.
Put me in mind of the 'Sokoban' type puzzels. 
Finished in a few sittings, (Power & Local RADAR) play havoc with equipment, here!

Can we expect more levels, or is it hackable for addons?

Will make an amusing demo, when I get to show my rift to visitors.","Oct 25, 2018 at 1:47 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:23:24.824212,FastLawyer,Best played with Xbox controller,"Not only is this best played with an Xbox controller (with Oculus remote being 2nd best option), but it's best to use the directional pad to turn left or right and using the triggers to move forward.  Using the joystick will lead to several missteps as it is too sensitive.  I was not really enjoying the first few levels.  I was really confused about what the game was about.  But then the game slowly starting adding more elements to the puzzles.  The nice thing is that when these elements are introduced, you get really easy puzzles.  Complete no-brainers.  But after each stage, the difficulty slowly ramps up.  Soon I was seeing the solution in my mind before even moving around.  I new the steps needed to solve the puzzle and it was just a matter of executing them correctly on the controller.  I don't normally like this type of puzzle game, but what this game does right is that VR actually adds to the gameplay.  A lot of puzzle games you have to wonder what if anything VR brought to the game experience.  Not the case here.  I just wish that it felt more like you were a person actually walking these seps.  Maybe with gravity boots.  It did feel nice when you fell into traps.  But I wanted more of that feeling throughout.  That it's you having to solve these puzzles or else.  Often times it felt like you were just controlling a robot or empty space.","Dec 17, 2017 at 4:34 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:23:24.839172,kingtut_uk,Liked it.,"I came into this game thinking about the film ""Cube"" then after a short while getting used to the controls the game was finished. A shame, but I do hope the Devs add more levels, as just going round and round the current levels is not really enough to make me want to come back to it any time soon.
Still a recommended game to pass a bit of time.","Jun 9, 2017 at 7:22 AM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 18:23:27.959825,GreenSquid772,"Decent, atmospheric VR puzzler","‘Neverout’ is an atmospheric puzzle game set in a mysterious testing facility made up of cube-shaped rooms. You are able to walk freely on every flat surface in a room, and gravity constantly reorients itself according to your facing. This allows you to fling around objects and avoid hazards.

The graphics are simple (this was originally a Gear VR game, I believe) but handled well, with clear visuals and effective use of textures creating a good sense of presence. I also felt the developers did a great job creating a sinister, foreboding atmosphere that really makes you feel like you are a lab rat in some sort of strange experiment.

It’s a shame that the excellent atmosphere never pays any dividends on the story front. In fact, apart from an incredibly brief opening scene and an abrupt, ambiguous conclusion, ‘Neverout’ has no story whatsoever. I didn’t buy this game expecting an intricate plot with dozens of characters, but a few more nuggets of story or a couple of non-puzzle interludes would have been a welcome addition.

As for the gameplay... it’s fun, but don’t expect any fiendish challenges here. The overall difficulty is fairly low, and there is nothing in the game that really requires you to manipulate systems in unusual ways or think outside of the box (literally, in this case). A few of the later puzzles are more challenging, but for the most part it is fairly simple to identify the required end-state of the room and work backwards from there. Still, I did find the puzzles satisfying to solve, and the game was absorbing enough to compel me to finish it in a single evening. Based on that, I feel confident recommending it to others :)","Jun 17, 2017 at 11:36 AM",4, 15,
