2022-05-28 14:54:28.847512,JCat,The E-Ticket of Theme Park fun!,"I purchased this when it first came out - many moons ago, and since then, the devs have updated it so many times, adding more themed attractions. It's kind of an experience/game hybrid. Walk around the park, ride different attractions and play many of the boardwalk-style games. There's a decent amount of content to explore and it does give this immerservie feeling of being at a theme park. 

The two AAA must-see attractions: The RollerCoaster and and this underwater sub-type ride. The underwater attraction alone is worth the price of admission. You'll see what I mean.... (watch for the big surprise). The Rollercoaster is more fantasty than realistic, but it's smooth and  doesn't get you sick like some of the other badly made crappy VR coasters at there.  I love just standing in front of the park map to plot out my course. The only thing I don't care for are the other park folk. They're well animated, but a bit on the creepy side. At one point, I was looking at the park map, only to turn around and have this dude right up in my face. He scared the heck out of me, to the point I screamed WTF are you doing, man?","Nov 23, 2020 at 5:07 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:54:28.863469,BrittaMcMorran,The VR Gold Standard for Amusement Parks,"If you like the amusement park/county fair experience and all of the games and rides that go with it this is the place to go.  Hands down no other VR amusement park game comes anywhere near it for quality or the sheer number of games, rides and experiences available in the park. 

This is not the kind of thing you will play through in a few hours or even a few days, at least weeks i would think, if your like me and want to get perfect scores thru all of the mini games and challenges it will probably take months.  The games are easy to understand and fun to play but quite difficult to master, not all of them but enough to make you work for it.  There are several well done play throughs on YouTube you can watch to give you some tips.

A few of the games are very replay-able and could be stand alone games sold separately.  

The developers have added two free expansions to the game that i know of.

The underwater experience/ride is incredible, don’t miss that.

You won’t regret buying this.  It will take quite a while to earn all of the achievements and find all of the hidden easter eggs (and stuffed monsters.) but it will be fun.

*No i don’t work for the developers i just really enjoy the care they took with every single detail and wish there were more games like this.","Sep 16, 2020 at 6:04 AM",5, 4,

I really wish you could ride the Ferris Wheel since it's the first biggest attraction you see. I hope you can add that as a ride in a future update! Defintely missed a huge part of the amusement park feel by leaving that part out. Also, wish the rollercoaster had an intense mode without motion sickness protection. Lastly, there should be a trigger for the fireworks show once you unlock night mode. I just want to be able to lay back in my chair and enjoy it. Still a fun game, defintely recommend.","Jul 25, 2020 at 3:29 AM",4, 6,

Only 4 stars, because some mechanics feel clunky/stiff. The other guests in the park seem very robotic and do not interact with the environment at all (except for staring at each other sometimes).
The newly added Sports Island is a great addtition, but the physics feel off in my opinion, but it's overall a great, free expansion to an already diverse game. I'd definitely pick it up for it's full price (about 20$ as of the date of this review), yet alone when it's on sale.","Mar 29, 2020 at 2:56 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 14:54:35.216187,terbiume65,Beautiful theme park with its flaws,"The game manages to build a dream theme park - way too dreamy and colourful to a point that it may make you feel creepy and motion sick at times. For the most part I enjoyed the game. You can tell that a lot of effort is being put into the environment and texture design. It puts you in a beautiful theme park with all the experiences that you would expect from one. You can play with theme park games, rides, fully interactive objects like popcorn, balloons and gumball machines. There's always a bit of fun here and there and the environment is very beautiful. Nevertheless, there are some flaws. I have experienced two bugs in my first 20 minutes of gameplay. One of the AI twitches in front of one of the entrances, and the shooting game doesn't work as three sets of gun showed up at the stall and none of them shoot! (I only saw a shooting cursor from one of the guns for a split of a second all so but ultimately nothing works despite my attempts of trying to walk in and out of it). And I would agree with others that some of the stars are too difficult to get as well. One more thing is that some of the places, for reasons unknown, give me motion sickness. I found that kind of weird as I have never experienced motion sickness in VR before. There's something with the colours of sports island that just mades me sick as soon as I walk around it for 2-3 minutes. Even the roller coaster didn't cause me that. I don't know if it's just me or if anyone else has this issue too.
A further suggestion to improve this game would be adding partial multiplayer so that you can hang out with your friends or even a date in this beautiful theme park.","Feb 10, 2020 at 6:30 PM",4, 4,

The rides are fun, half the time my eyes are wide open in surprise/enjoyment.  The atmosphere is semi-great.  Only in the lacking of multiplayer.  This place feels like an amusement park that's about to shut down due to lack of patrons.  Virtually no AI, no MP, so nobody is present.  Who the heck goes to an amusment park ALONE?

2022-05-28 14:54:44.646299,Lunaste,"Worth It, but not all of it","Would like to start off with a very well put together experience and a thank you to the Developers.
My credentials for a reliable review is that im a connoisseur of the Disneylands.
The opening gates and ambient sounds of people enjoying themselves was fantastic. Felt excitement from the beginning. 
The inclusion of NPC's walking around was a fantastic idea because it would be very offputing if it was a ghost town.
But about the content.
You put almost a dozen well put together games into one. Like The Climb to name one. 
But after my joy and fun of this game, i don't feel like there was enough to it. I dont think it was quite worth the $20 I spent. It was lacking in putting depth into the attractions (the space one).
The Maze just felt like hard work with no rewards (visual, points, temporary apparel or gags).
 I think linking any of the scores of the mini games to a leaderboard would even add a nice touch.
I may be ignorant of the activity of the devs, but I hope my contribution is motivation to add more playable content instead of overpriced DLC.
TLDR:
I dont regret buying it, but the rides are a one time enjoyment, but to get its worth ill have to watch friends and family enjoy it until more content is released. 
Thank you for your hard work on this game!","Mar 12, 2019 at 12:59 PM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:54:44.662256,Dirckinator,"Definitely worth the price, lots of fun","My partner wanted a roller-coaster VR experience after reminiscing about the Tokyo SkyDeck/ SkyCircus VR experience, and after looking through the roller-coaster options we decided to buy this. Although the 'normal' rollercoaster is only fairly good (the speed seems off a couple of times), the rest of the experience is excellent (although maybe the 'steady-hands' maze thing could be improved). This game has been the most used VR game in our house so far, followed by Skyrim VR and Robo Recall. The semi-hidden rainbow unicorn ride is a great alternative to the 'standard' roller-coaster too. I hope the developers provide updates or even create expansions and I'd happily pay for them if they did.","Feb 18, 2019 at 10:21 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 14:54:44.694171,nightcat.mau,Open Letter To Dev,"Since your website refuses to take my e-mail: 

To Whom It May Concern,

I'm wondering if it would be possible to unlock the night mode in the game. As I stated in a previous review via the Oculus Rift I have vertigo and other disabilities which make some aspects of the game unplayable. Try the shooting range with essential tremors (shaking hands) and you’ll see what I mean. There’s no way to control the tremors so it isn’t a case of me having to “get gud”. 

And my vertigo makes the tower impossible, I can’t even get on a step stool in real life and there’s really no fixes you can do on your end for either problem. So I’d appreciate it if you’d consider making night mode possible. I’d fix it myself to save you any effort but someone was smart enough to code the game in advanced gobbelydygook.

The Space Adeventure, while short, also has lovely graphics (they all do really), and if you're a Batman fan, you'll get to ride through Gotham on his Batbike.

Essentilly this is collection of experiences/mini-games tied together and packaged into a theme park.   The sit back and enjoy rides are all pretty good and the games are all fun very varied. One minute I was bopping penguins on the head, the next trying to climb up the exterior of a light house.

The downside is that it won't take you a huge amount of time to complete and once you do there is perhaps little repeat value but it works well as a demo to show off to friends and if you have kids I think there is far more longevity as the games are reasonably difficult but would be challenging for kids.

2022-05-28 14:54:50.994089,FastLawyer,Updated game is much better,"UPDATED REVIEW:  

First of all, the underwater submarine ride has been updated and it's now better than ever.  The gotham bike ride is also better.  The rollercoaster ride is also much better and vastly different than the original.  The shooting game is still not so good, but it's better than what it was.  You get to punch squirrels.  Seriously.  You get to punch squirrels for points.  There's a climb tower game that looks awesome, but the climbing could have been done better.  You get to whack moles with two mallets!  You enter candyland and bat candies into huge targets.  It's a very beautifully rendered candy land.  You ride a unicorn while jousting in a retro neon style that may make you go colorblind or make you think you are tripping on shrooms!  Amazing ride.  You throw a ball into lava holes.  You look for lost toys.  And best of all ... .they took out PewDiePie!  WOAH!  I added one more star just for that.  

Old Review Below: 

1.  Underwater ride - You are in a an old-fashioned, small submarine taken on an epic, wild ride, where you tour an underwater world full of mystical creatures, plants, and ancient, mysterious structures.  You'll want to show this ride off to friends and family to show the power of VR.
2.  Gotham ride - you are in a batmobile like ride/vehicle where you zip across the streets and subterrenean areas of Gotham city.  This would have been awesome if you could actually drive it.
3.  Rollercoaster ride - a pretty well done rollercoaster experience across the amusement park
4. A below-average shooting gallery where you can finally use your Oculus Touch controllers to shoot some cardboard things that pop up and move around, you can also shoot the cowgirl next to you (but no damage to her)
5.  An awful VR cinema experience where you're basically watching YouTube ads for G2A.com and Pewdiepie ... Just avoid this altogether, they should pay you to watch this","Mar 4, 2018 at 3:49 AM",5, 9,

Probably not a lot of replayability, but I spent an hour in it easily checking out all the experiences, and I've done them all 3-4 times. It is pretty decent graphics and it is fun to stroll through the tiny little park. There is a pretty awesome submarine ride and batman motorcyle ride. There is a climbing wall, shooting arcade, and several wack-a-mole type carnival games all with touch support. If you are looking for a fun roller coaster, don't bother. Coaster is totally unrealistic and in my opinion just ridiculous.","Mar 31, 2018 at 1:41 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 14:54:57.296343,MAJ161.RED,Can't get past loading screen UPDATED,"I loved the original version of this and was thrilled to see it was being updated with more content. When I tried to run it, I got the loading message but the screen froze.  It didn't load. UPDATE:  I deactivated the new Oculus Home and went back to the simpler Home menu (the room with the rug) and Summer Funland loaded with no problems. Since then there was an Oculus update - and I reactivated the new Home menu (with rooms and stuff). Summer Funland still loads fine. Whether that's because I restarted Home or because of the update, I dont know.
Well - what do I think of the experience? As I said I loved the original version. It was one of the first experiences I would show friends - after First Contact and The Blu. The rides were  a great way to introduce newbies to VR.
The underwater ride is still great but seems to have improved sharper and clearer graphics. I'm noticing things I didn't before. Same for the Batman bike ride. Also, the way they are presented -in a lobby, with models of the sub and batbike to look at, puts them into a much more interesting context. The roller coaster too benefits from clearer graphics and and a lobby. The new ride, set in space, is de;ightful - and the way it unfolds is spectacular.
The old, really bad, cinema experience is gone - replaced with a smaller cinema showing game credits. I think that's a wasted opportunity and the screen could be put to better use. Game or film trailers perhaps.
The shooting range is much the same but now the guns reload themselves.
The new funfair games are fun though you probably won't play them more than once or twice. Younger children might like them.The lighthouse game is interesting. I only tried it once and didn't reach the top yet. It could be a good ""beat your last score"" game. The Rainbow Unicorn ride is fun, though I won't play it again. 
All in all, it's much better.But is it worth the price? I got it as a free upgrade of G2A LAND. I like it.","Feb 26, 2018 at 4:28 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 14:54:57.344215,grekb,Its kinda old,"Most of the attractions are not interactive and the graphics are not that good. Even if you enable supersampling 2.0 from oculus tools its still not that good and gives you the impression its from an old graphics engine. The interactive minigames are ok but nothing special. Compared to NVIDIAfunhouse, witch is free, they are not that fun. It was also weird that in a fun park there were no kids, just adult ""babes"". Overall the ideas behind the minigames and the scenarios of the non-interactive attractions(especially the underworld and the batmobile) were good but it seems that they werent executed that well and they were lacking polishing. If you want some minigames for your kids get NvidiaVRfunhouse for free. It has better graphics, more games, more fun. If you want to see some non interactive scenes for 5-10 minutes i guess you have a reason to buy it.

2022-05-28 14:55:00.468466,Nytek12110,Beautiful - Vast Improvement,"This new update added greater detail, clarity, and pixel density than most of the other VR titles that I've experienced so far. The underwater ride,  cycle, and rollercoaster were given a superb nip and tuck. The new unicorn joust is surreal and gorgeous. Being able to cram that much detail and smoothness into these brief experiences makes me wish the company would put out a full-fledged AAA title.

Update: What happened?! 
The update with the new attractions and graphic refresh (1.1.0.10737) was amazing. Then there was another update the next day (1.2.0.2524) which just put back the original version before the update. Please tell me you're going to put the updated version back. It was the best collection of experiences I've seen on the Oculus so far and when I went back to it again, they were gone.","Feb 11, 2018 at 3:48 AM",4, 5,"Thanks for the feedback, we're so happy you loved the update!

Check out his solution and see if it works for you:
""I deactivated the new Oculus Home and went back to the simpler Home menu (the room with the rug) and Summer Funland loaded with no problems. Since then there was an Oculus update - and I reactivated the new Home menu (with rooms and stuff). Summer Funland still loads fine. Whether that's because I restarted Home or because of the update, I dont know. ""

2022-05-28 14:55:06.850574,alrick3000,Underwater attraction is THE BOMB!,"If you are a sucker for VR experiences, then by all means get this (at it's current sale price of 4.99). The underwater attraction is THE bomb! Definitely one of the most immersive experiences I've had in VR. I daresay it may even be better than theBlu when it comes to eliciting awe. The sound design is topnotch and very well complements  the above average visuals (slightly inferior to theBlu's). Unfortunately, it is the only attraction worth paying for. The rest felt like free demos. At it's sale price, this title is a no brainer. Take note that this is more for people who enjoy VR experiences, not gamers. It is hardly interactive, if at all.","Sep 29, 2017 at 1:44 PM",4, 1,

That is pretty much what it is. The cinema and shooting range are rubbish but the rides are great. I enjoyed the roller coaster and Gotham ride scene but the star is the underwater scene. I've personally done it three times now and the big sea monster makes me jump every time. Not sure if I'd pay the standard price but in this weekend's sale if you're looking for a few quick experiences to demo VR to friends and family I've not come across much better than the underwater ride on this.","Oct 1, 2017 at 1:11 AM",4, 0,
