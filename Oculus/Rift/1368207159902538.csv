2022-05-28 18:26:10.574887,FastLawyer,Nice brawler,"As other reviewers have mentioned, if you like brawlers like Double Dragon then this a modern take on the brawler.  I say modern because there's more combos, unlocks, special moves, item pickups, etc.  Also the boss fights are interesting.  There's a lot of enemy variety and also interesting locations.  The reason I only give it 3 stars is because I don't think VR gives any special immersion to this gametype.  Honestly, this game is probably more fun on a flat screen or at least it's easier to play that way.  And yeah, if you have friends as well it's probably more fun.","Nov 27, 2017 at 6:20 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 18:26:10.589848,Bloodymorgan,Like Double Dragon in VR,"Great game overall, good art design (excellent  humour), solid gameplay with a fantastic sound track. If you like old school beat'em ups like 2 crude dudes and double dragon you'll love this.","Sep 13, 2017 at 8:40 AM",5, 13,
