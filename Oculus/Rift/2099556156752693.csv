2022-05-28 19:47:10.574068,GrIppE91,great and innovative concept,"Dont get me wrong, i really enjoy this game and the concept behind it. But there are things which needs to be included for an even better experience. I figured that there is no heigh-tracking/adjust options implemented, so smaller persons (not me) will have trouble or cant play the game at all. The more important part for me is the lack of music variety in this game. The ingame tracks are really good but getting repetitive pretty quickly for me. How cool would it be to jam to your all time favourite bands or some new ones which you recently discovered? A cheap way would be some ingame audio options to rise/lower/mute the volume of the music, so you can use an external music player with your favourite tracks while playing. Or implement a feature which lets you add tracks from your computer to the game for example an ""external music folder"" which you can turn on/off in the options. Im looking forward to the progression of this game and will edit this review with joy when new features like the mentioned above will be implemented into the game.","Dec 23, 2019 at 7:11 AM",3, 2,

A battle progression game with a unique movement mechanic.... that's right, you beat your drums to move, avoid and attack.
I have not seen this done in a VR game before and it's pack full of satisfaction and fun.
