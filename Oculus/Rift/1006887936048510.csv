2022-05-28 16:50:40.656849,Warthog175,Not All That,I am new to the VR world and found this to be a sort of entertaining.  It did show me some of the possibilities that VR will offer but with the video being less then quality. The biggest disappointment was the fact that the audio track was totally out of sync with the video and hearing things during one scene that belong in an upcoming scene. This was a total turn off of the enjoyment of learning what VR has to offer.,"Feb 23, 2020 at 8:45 PM",2, 13,

Higher resolution and higher framerate makes this look much more realistic, and the 3D effect is very noticeable. Definitely recommend to have a benchmark on what 360º video should look like.","Jan 17, 2020 at 7:04 AM",4, 6,

However throughout I experienced bizarre distortions (stretch/squash) in the image when moving my head, resulting in a slightl;y nauseating experience (and I am quite experienced with VR, so this was a surprise!)
Secondly the audio appeared to be completely out of sync for the length of the film. Finishing about 30 seconds early. As there are no settings and no menu to even press play, I could find no way to resolve these issues.","Dec 29, 2019 at 10:02 PM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 16:51:09.086809,innovacy,"A better title would be ""Introduction...","A better title would be ""Introduction to 360 Video"". It's good. But it gets 2 points less because it focus on only one very narrow point of VR only. On viewing things in 360, but not more than that, showcasing nothing regarding interaction in VR or even movement through VR. It is actually just a short (a bit too short for the size it is) presentation of travelling on some places on earth with the help of VR and being in space and not much more, then the likes. But VR has so many more applications of different kinds, which this is not even touching, unfortunately. So, if it wants to be a presentation of the possibilities in VR (by the definition of the creators) and an introduction to it, then it gets simply not far enough, covers maybe only 20% (if even that) of what VR is and can do, it simply reaches not it's goal. Based on this view, 3 stars are even much. Otherwise it's good and for those relatively new in VR it would be cool to check it out. Just once.","Jul 10, 2017 at 7:53 AM",3, 3,
