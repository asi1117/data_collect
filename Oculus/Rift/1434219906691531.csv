First of all this game is quite fun, the first levels pretty easy but it gets harder over time. I simple describe the game as arcade, shooting gallery type of game. Having said that it does the job pretty well in compare with other shooting gallery games. 

I experienced it as pretty accurate and appreciate the realistic running around of the enemies instead of plain standing objects in some other gallery shooters. Its really fun to safe the hostages and the allover agent idea is entertaining.

Yes, it could have more content, yes it could be more complex but then you cant complain about the price! For just a view $, this is a great fun game to have. 

Also easy to play, and friends who have not much experience with VR, get it right away and start shooting stuff without the need to learn first complicated reload, etc. buttons.

The graphics and game handling are also pretty good for a cheap game like that. I give easy 4 stars and the only thing I wich is actually MORE (content) to have some more fun with it. 

The developers should be proud of this little shooter, since its much better then many others available which are more expensive.","Jul 25, 2020 at 11:29 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:25:23.050000,Jake_Dragon,For the price its a fun game,"So I got this game for $5 and played for 20 minutes, it did lock up on me once.
I look forward to more content but even if this is it I appreciate the game for the price.
Well done

Thanks for checking out our game. Sorry to hear you didn't like it.

Our goal was to make a shooter with puzzle elements. This is among the reasons why there is no movement in the game."
