2022-05-28 19:33:02.414373,ZAF,3rd attemp,So I tried this game with Oculus head gear then with RIFT and just then again for a 2nd try with RIFT ... This is not only the worst poker game but the worst game I have ever tried ... I lost all my chips trying to use the controls then tried to put in requested email to get more chips - also a complete failure ... AGAIN I un-install this bad experience ....,"Dec 29, 2018 at 6:36 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 19:33:02.430330,CmdrRiker,One of the best social VR experiences,"A great poker game with some nice VR touches, as you can see from the video above. There is a great community of players. Also, the Devs listen to feedback and are actively looking to improve an already fun game.","Nov 1, 2018 at 11:28 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:33:02.445289,HiThere_,Best looking VR poker platform,"The PC level graphics and advanced player interaction are it's high points, also you can have up to 8 players per table (instead of only 6)... But when it comes to respecting poker rules on minimum raises or folding in turn, or bothering to perform a rollback when they mess up big time with their latest patch (which they do)... well that's where you're better off looking for a VR poker platform with worse graphics and less interaction, but proper poker mechanics and game management.","Aug 18, 2018 at 12:08 PM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 19:33:05.578534,Heathen_OG,My favorite VR game,"I've been playing Metatable Poker since I got my Oculus Rift in March of this year and it is by far my favorite game and the only game I play multiple times per week.  The poker play is real and it does not cost anything unless you choose to buy chips.  Most players will help new players starting out to build their bank rolls, which leads me to the best aspect of the game...the social aspect.  As a regular player, I have become friends with several people in the game and look forward to playing with them when I log in.  It's amazing that we all come from different parts of the world, yet we feel like we're sitting in the same room together.  It's a fun social game.  I highly recommend to poker players of all skill levels.  The developers are very active in communicating with the players and getting feedback for improvements.  I've seen this game improve in a few short months and I can't wait to see what's next.  Love this game!","Jul 29, 2018 at 8:41 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:33:05.593494,OculusAbsolute,Lets hope a better poker game arrives...,"You only get a few thousand free chips every 24hrs, farming the AI bots is not hard so it boosts your cash, most players only play in the higher tables, and theres not that many of them online, most are usa timezone, therefore at the lower tables is not so easy to get a decent game going...

the system for picking up chips aint perfect and glithces out a few times and its not a exact science either so everyone just flings a stack into the centre.

its alright the game looks good enough, its fun with a freindly community all be it extrememly tiny and its worth playing, speaking of cash to buy chips they want a $100 for 1.5million on pokerstars that would cost me around $6 

not happening !!! 
(not forgetting PS free chips = every hour)

as the title says lets hope a few rivals come along, because whilst decent its aint all that great either...","Aug 16, 2018 at 3:27 AM",2, 3,

They give 5k every 12 hours for broke players, rift+gear+go can play together, the first winner of the first tournament got 3millions reward, promising more tournaments in the future, and many cool things that you should check them out","Aug 7, 2018 at 1:52 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:33:05.623414,radfera,My second home,"Very realistic!!! Reminds me of the good old days when I used to play poker late nights with my buddies.  I like being able to throw my chips and cards along with other items I can purchase with chips.  I play this game more than any other game.  

The only thing I would change is giving people who lose all their money more than $1000 after 24 hours.  Maybe even giving it to them within 12 hours instead or even better one thousand every hour so they can build back up to the starting amount of ten thousand.  I don't mind giving people who are about to lose all their money free handout, so they can continue playing uninterupted, but I would rather not if at all possible.","Jul 29, 2018 at 5:43 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:33:11.949800,Dropla,Super fun!,"It's great when you get into a table with a bunch of witty BS'ers and have at eachothers chip stacks ~ Fun handing them a pile of poo to eat after a bad hand and also fun to throw hats upon thine enemy's heads ~ just lots of fun ` worth playing for sure!

 For those complaining about wanting more free chips in the free game to start with, umm, maybe don't go all in with a 7 3 off suit hoping to scare someone off and actually build your stack? These devs cant be expected to work to make this game for free for you and never charge a cent. You get free chips daily and start with some...just play poker and not bingo, and you should do alright ^.~","Feb 22, 2018 at 9:53 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:33:15.080005,danmoore.cts,No way to get more chips except to buy,"There is no way to attain more chips except through microtranactions which is ridiculous. 
You start with 10,000, and there are maybe one or two other players playing at a time. Usually one or more of said players will have 1,000,000+ chips and just bully you out of the game. Good concept but poor and greedy implementation. One star. Wait for a better No Limit Hold 'Em game.","Jan 13, 2018 at 3:23 AM",1, 2,"We are sorry you had a bad experience. All new users can gain 5k additional chips by entering their email address. In addition, you will be given up to 1k chips per day to play with for returning to the game.

2022-05-28 19:33:15.095963,74Loki,Great customer support,This still has some kinks to be fleshed out in it but it's a great poker platform. I've had a few bugs but the developers have always been quick to respond and take care of things. The only downside is we need more of a player base. If you enjoy texas hold 'em then you should check it out. Those complaining about only being able to buy chips after busting out are generally the all-in-donkeys who it's nice not to have to be quite honest. They have since added a daily bonus though that you can get 1000 chips free a day. The only reason I give it a 4 instean of 5 is because there are still some bugs to be worked out but the devs seem to be working on them.,"Jan 17, 2018 at 8:15 PM",4, 2,

It has a few glitches, and is a working progress, but the developers are quick to address the issues and fix them. They are also eager to take feedback and suggestions to make it better. If you have a problem with the game, the developers will make sure you are taken care of. 4 of 5 stars due to some bug issues, but 5 star for customer service. I love playing this game, and the interactions between players is really fun.
