2022-05-28 15:20:22.104459,holyraine1,its fairly good,this game is basically a mini legend of zelda where you go through a course killing all monsters in your way with either your crossbow or sword. it got a little repetitive but i still enjoyed it. i really liked the god powers mechanic and how the majority of powers you got were useful in combat as well as being necessary to traverse the landscape. the game was pretty short for the price (my complete playthrough was only 4 hours) but i could definetely see myself replaying this sometime,"Jul 2, 2020 at 3:25 AM",4, 21,

2022-05-28 15:20:25.223118,taquitobuddy,Competent basic RPG/action game,"This one is a light-rpg game with a decent amount of content (about 6-8 hours) and some variety to the gameplay.  The graphics are quite simplistic and the combat is passable but not much better than that.  Still, for a low price it is a decent all-around title.","May 3, 2020 at 11:57 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 15:20:25.237080,toaster_mmmmmm,"I have the game, but its not installing","I installed the game and played for a few mintutes and then closed it. I uninstalled it to make space for something else and ever since then I haven't been able to redownload it  (and yes, I have enough space for it now)","Mar 22, 2020 at 10:22 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:20:25.252040,Wunderbear,Nice looking game,Only played the very first level and really liking the look of it. No motion sickness as others have stated. I actually love the graphics. Thew Crossbow is nice to use.  One small problem. Can we not have forward movement on both sticks or a choice of either. Have you tried moving and using a sword with the same hand? It's not very practial. I'm keeping the game for now in the hope that you add this. Will update my comments when/if you do this!,"Nov 22, 2019 at 5:23 AM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 15:20:25.267000,TheAllStarr,Beautiful game and a must have for Quest,I've played it on both the Quest and my PC through the Link and it still stands as one of my favorite. Highly recommended. It has a lot of artistic stylings and heart.,"Dec 13, 2019 at 11:30 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:20:25.282957,Tygron,Loved it,"Great game, definitely worth picking up. Would be nice if the saves crossed over to my Quest so I could have continued at work, but that's fine. It's just a fun adventure with a cute little story. There are a few moments where I feel there's not enough cues on what to do (the last bit took me a minute to figure out what I was doing wrong) but there's not too much of that. I've seen people compare this to The Legend of Zelda type games, and I see where people are getting that but I wouldn't quite make that comparison myself. It's definitely a step in the right direction for that and I hope the devs make some sort of sequel or something with the same ideology behind it.","Oct 27, 2019 at 10:45 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:20:28.392640,DAN_di_WARhol,,Good. Frustrating gesture mechanics mar it. Trying ten times to get a gesture just right in the heat of a battle is annoying. That led to me not using gestures at all.,"Apr 5, 2020 at 3:31 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:20:28.407600,GreenSquid772,,"The dream of going on immersive adventures in a fantasy world is one of the main reasons why I got into VR. ‘Journey of the Gods’ is one of the best attempts so far at fulfilling this dream.

The gameplay is a nice translation of Zelda-style combat to VR. You need to stay on your toes and effectively use your sword, shield and crossbow to counter each type of enemy.

The graphics look simple but they work incredibly well in the headset. The environments are actually quite beautiful and give a sense of vast scale. The sound design is great and really sells the illusion that you’re journeying through a lush forest or claustrophobic dungeon. 

The African-influenced setting was refreshing. I also enjoyed the ending stretch of the game – good finales are quite rare in VR games, but I got pretty hyped up here!

My main gripe is that the “God powers” don’t feel all that useful or satisfying. Also, I wish the NPCs had deeper personalities and proper dialogue – although I did enjoy their lively animations. 

While I greatly enjoyed the experience I got, I wouldn’t have minded a longer game. I would LOVE a sequel to this, with a bigger budget to allow a longer campaign and expanded game world. Oculus, please make it happen!","Aug 3, 2019 at 1:45 PM",5, 25,Thank you so much for all the feedback and support!!!!
2022-05-28 15:20:28.423557,ARMOR210,"Wish I could give it a 5, so close!","All it would take is to add a jump button. This is just a nitpick I have about all VR games that don't allow you the ability to jump, nothing more immerion breaking than not being able to jump onto a rock that is next to you. That being said, this game is one of the best VR games out. I have both the Quest verison and the Rift. Both are great but the lighting, increased folage, effects, and detail makes for a huge step up on the Rift S. 

Hey dev's! Just add a jump button and it's a 5*

Another thing, this would make a great open world RPG or even a MMORPG.  :)","Jun 19, 2019 at 4:55 AM",4, 61,
2022-05-28 15:20:28.437520,Masamune5454,excellent zelda homage.,"just plain beautiful and fun. the graphics are what you see in the video above.  theres a nice vibe coming from this game, and the hands and overall looks are cool to me. im not sure how long the game is, and i wish it was a open world game. i dont understand why it isnt actually. teleporters and powers and equipment, i mean they could make the missions be dungeons and add a big open world connecting everything together, using the teleporters. if they decide to add stuff, the first thing i want is a inventory system. it would be sweet if all the  arrow powerups and weapon upgrades were able to be forged at the people, but insstead monsters drop items and you can farm them and physically place them in bag. also more stuff like tools or weapons would be good, then you could buy them sell ect. just to add replayability.","Jun 19, 2019 at 12:32 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 15:20:28.453478,morningland,I am finally Link!,"When Twilight Princess came out on the Wii in 2006, I recalled being so excited to finally swing my sword around as Link thanks to the motion controls.  Once I actually played the game I instantly realized that the tech wasn't there yet and swinging your sword was little more than twitching your wrist.  It would take 13 more years for the technology to provide the experience but here we are!

Do not be put off by the simple graphics.  For one thing, the game looks beautiful but the thing that really impressed me was the gameplay and how natural everything feels.  I've gotta say, this and Moss have got to be some of the most enchanting PC VR games I've played.  This game is absolutely worth every single penny.  Don't hesitate to give this game a try!  You won't regret it!

I can't stress enough how perfect the game play feels.  The game is also very challanging yet never frusterating and the developer included enough customizations to the gameplay and difficulty to suit almost anyone.  I finished the game in about 6-8hrs which felt like the perfect time for a VR title.  

This is a must own and almost a required purchase to help support the development of high quality VR titles!","Jul 6, 2019 at 6:53 PM",5, 14,Wow! We really appreciate the love and support!
2022-05-28 15:20:31.525262,superpozition,Simple ****ing amazing,"Just get it. If you want Zelda in VR, this game crushes everything out there. The graphics are crisp perfect and the immersion is spot on. You’ll feel like a god, like Link, and like a hero.","Sep 6, 2019 at 9:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:20:31.541219,ParadiseDecay,Cool Zelda Vibes in this adventure romp!,"My Initial Impressions:
OK so this might just be a Quest port with additional effects, and the effects on the Rift S do add a bit more depth and immersion, but at the heart this is a cool fantasy adventure in the style of Zelda from the creative developers who brought us Face Your Fears.  I really enjoyed the story, atmosphere and creative direction of this game.  If you can look beyond the graphic syle on offer here, you are in for a treat.

2022-05-28 15:20:31.570141,RuneSR2,This isn't VR,"Actually I don't really know what this is - I feel it's something wanting to be a beautiful and artistic VR game, but it can't be. The graphics quality is so extremely poor compared to other Rift games that it simply kills presence. Although the game performs perfect 90 fps even when using super sampling 2.0 on my 1080 GTX, the graphics quality is simply horrible. There're no real textures in this game, there're just colored surfaces, and the polygon count is extremely low. If this was a game costing 10 bucks, I would have awarded 3 stars, but 30 bucks is close to the price of Lone Echo. And two games couldn't be further apart when it comes to presence. Sound is great in this game though, and tracking was fine, but graphics are like 10 times worse than Vanishing Realms - and that says a lot ;-) Add grass like in Ethan Carter and photo-realistic textures like in Mage's Tale and this game could shine on the Rifts. But shine is the very last thing this poor game does on the Rifts, and I really feel sad having to refund a game I had such high hopes for. This feels like the Quest version, I can't see that the devs made any significant changes trying to increase details on the Rifts.","Jun 19, 2019 at 5:18 AM",2, 18,
2022-05-28 15:20:31.585101,nickrei250,Honestly i was surprised,"A lot of people were saying that this isnt a visually appealing game , but that just means the art style isnt for them. This game is beautiful in its own right, and the combat feels fluid and rewarding. Definitely happy i bought it for my Rift S .","Jun 19, 2019 at 11:13 AM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 15:20:34.722709,Sollith,Worthwhile purchase,"Journey of the goods is an enjoyable adventure game with a fun art style. While not quite 4-5 stars on a technical level, the game is enjoyable enough to warrant a purchase by almost everyone.

The gameplay is very polished and works well. Swinging the sword around feels good; speed and distance is indicated by an increasing glow and hum of the blade. Blocking with the shield feels nice too; it only takes a certain number of hits within a given amount of time, which keeps the player on their toes instead of turtling the entire time. The crossbow is also fun to use and require the player pulling a lever to reload it.

God mode provides the player with a number of abilities from manipulating the landscape to throwing lightning and charming enemies to attack each other.

The levels are very linear with a few collectibles used for minor upgrades, so the main appeal here are going to be the boss fights. Each boss has a different mechanic to beat it, similar to some fights in the Legend of Zelda games. Sometimes you have to attack certain weak spots on a boss, wait for those weak spots to be exposed, attack certain spots to stun the boss and expose thier weak spot, etc.

I do wish there was a jump button for a little more vertical exploration and maybe some more puzzles. Level design could have been more expansive and with a greater variety, such as exploring ancient temple ruins or something.

The game is ported from Quest, so it seems we are confined to the limitations of that device going forward for anything funded by Oculus.","Jun 20, 2019 at 5:07 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:20:34.738667,Book0fThoth,Definitly Worth A Playthrough,"I thought the game was great but i do have some minor things i think could change. i think that there should be more enemy types and longer story but other than that it is a good game. and maybe lower the price to like 20-25$

Edit For Dev Question: The first and last boss are super fun and you have to think quick to beat them. I also like how there isnt any ""hand holding"" through those boss fights. if you did add some content to the game I personally would like a bow with special upgrades. i really enjoyed the game would love some more to play from you guys :)","Jul 12, 2019 at 5:41 AM",4, 2,Thanks for the feedback!
