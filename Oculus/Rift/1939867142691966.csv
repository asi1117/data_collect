2022-05-28 17:50:49.128996,Rudalpl,"Ok, I bought it...","Ok, I have to change my review of this demo.
While the demo is prety good and works flawlessly the game itself isn't.
Ep.1 is bugged and broken, almost unplayable. Don't buy it.","Jan 27, 2019 at 3:19 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 17:50:52.250647,lch6257,Super creative,It’s a puzzle and just drops you in with little direction. This is part of its charm. The graphics and atmosphere are amazing. I am planning on purchasing all episodes this is incredible with room scale! My jaw dropped with this.,"Oct 20, 2018 at 10:19 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:50:52.264609,JohnnyLee,Pretty cool,Very short demo but cool gameplay. Would definitely wait for these devs to put the two games on sale before purchasing.,"Nov 12, 2018 at 3:02 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 17:50:52.279570,Royman011,Had to load but. . .,"Ok. The first time I loaded the game, it sat there for maybe 10 minutes before it opened but now it opens just fine. The actually game, well, I wouldn't pay $30 for it but this demo is awesome!","Sep 30, 2018 at 5:21 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:50:52.293532,ZaneKata,Broken Game,"Refuses to load. I had this on Steam, and it worked just fine. I try downloading it on Oculus, and it acts like it doesn't want to open. Get the Steam version of this if it's not working on here.","Jul 17, 2018 at 10:18 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 17:50:52.310487,jayhawk,Does Not Need Tutorial,"For those saying it needs more hand holding, I'm an idiot and made it through the demo so there. 
I was entertained by the demo and just loved the 'pass the stone though the obstacles' door/chest keys. I have never done anything like that in VR and it was way cool.","Jan 8, 2018 at 10:07 AM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 17:50:55.425157,FastLawyer,Future of Oculus home page,It's not bad for being free.  Really shows off how nice the graphics are in the actual game.  Has some puzzles and backstory to the main game I suppose.  I managed to open 2 of the 3 doors.  I have no idea how to open the 3rd door.  Maybe I missed something.  You have to put balls in the right place.  I didn't see where to put the extra balls I had.  But there's nothing here to make me want to push forward.,"Dec 19, 2017 at 12:32 PM",3, 22,
2022-05-28 17:50:55.440116,HeyJesseAe,Outstanding!,"Very well polished game demo. The movement is a bit hard to pin down as it doesn't reorient you on jump, but it's still good. Very fun, worth your time.","Jan 21, 2018 at 10:47 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:50:55.454079,AuralGasm,needs tutorial,"the actual game might be good, but this ""demo"" is terrible. no idea what i'm suppose to do. the minimal tutorial doesn't help. spent the entire time confused until i had enough and quit.","Jan 2, 2018 at 11:15 AM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 17:50:55.468041,Omitteddruid653,crashes,the game doesnt even start for me every time i atempt to play it the game just becomes unresponsive,"Jan 16, 2018 at 7:34 AM",1, 3,

2022-05-28 17:50:58.563762,want2fly1,Emberstone a lot of game for free,"Hard to enjoy all of the game, needs more help or hints to get to everything. Could very easily be 5stars.","Dec 25, 2017 at 6:34 AM",3, 0,
