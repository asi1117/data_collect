In this game, you really have to run in place.  You can't just wave your arms.  I was able to run in place with 2 sensors and standing room only, but I wouldn't recommend it because you really need some room space before you accidentally knock something over as you'll naturally move even when trying to run in place.  Nice cartoonish graphics (I'd love this game with realistic graphics though!).  There are two modes.  One where you just run in traffic and avoid getting hit by cars or jumping on logs, etc.  The other mode is that plus avoiding getting hit by alien lasers by continously running as much as possible.  Anyways, you'll be sweating after a few minutes.  Only way I know of to trick your brain into having fun while actually jogging.  I hope they add the ability to add your own music to listen to in the future.  There is a leadboard as well (not sure if it's just local or online as well).","Sep 7, 2017 at 10:01 AM",5, 8,
