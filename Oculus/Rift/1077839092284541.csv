2022-05-28 16:41:44.006683,MysticLlama99,Strangely Addicting,"For as simple as this game is, it is oddly addicting and one of my most played titles.  It has a kind of racquetball feel and is the closest thing to racquetball in VR I have played.  There is some kind of backstory about an AI that is forcing humans to play this game and I think humans who lose might be eliminated or something, if you win you win your freedom and a new car?  Strangely, the plot and the AI's snarky comments are also compelling.  I wanted to pretend I was just playing racquetball but I eventually started getting into the game's backstory too.  Definitely recommend.  A huge playspace helps as well, taking my PC out to my garage where I could hit overhand swings and had a large play area made it almost a different game.","Sep 12, 2020 at 1:45 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:41:44.022641,SebastianIhrig,Best VR Game Out There,"This game is by far the best game ever, I spent so much time on it and have completed all the completeable challenges as best as possible, just wish more people played online. I am yet to face off against another player","May 24, 2019 at 9:39 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:41:44.037601,IndigoTea,"Fun VR workout, but missing features","The game's great fun, as a physical embodiment of Pong, and can definitely get the cardio up if you're looking to add a game to your VR fitness routine. However, there's a few missing elements that most other games allow for that would bring it up a notch.
1. Allow separate volume settings for game music vs. game effects - sometimes they overlap in a way that doesn't add to the experience, but just becomes annoying noise.
2. Provide a graceful way to exit the game; once you're in, there's no way to select a game menu option for ""Exit Game"" - at least, not that I've found so far.
3. Adjust for player height - it's clear that the game is designed for taller players, especially when reaching for the overhead shots. 
4. Allow player to select racquet mode; some might prefer a single racquet, for the additional difficulty level.

Additional notes: the game does give various achievements, but I've got to wonder why it gives awards for beating ""Easy"" and ""Medium"", but not ""Hard"" or ""Expert"".","Feb 11, 2019 at 7:27 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:41:44.053558,brainbox,Great game,This is a great game in all aspects. It transports the right 80's feeling and is just fun. Recently i noticed a very annoying bug where the ball just explodes after hitting it or after the ai were hitting it. Makes it unplayable at the moment for me. Please fix this.,"Jul 6, 2018 at 2:03 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:41:44.068518,raph81,Boring,"Gameplay is dull dull dull, graphics (as advertised, to be fair) poor, SFX are nerve-sawing. Much better options for racket sport games in VR. Got it on sale, still not worth the price in my opinion. Got bored after about 20 minutes, uninstalled and never going back.","Dec 8, 2017 at 11:55 PM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 16:41:47.206126,m1cr0star,Really fun...,"I can only play one level, though. When the name entry comes up after winning (or losing) and I enter my name nothing happens. I've tried everything. So, I have to quit the game and  load it back up and nothings saved so... I wouldn't recommend it and hopefully I can get an answer because I really would like to play this game.","Jun 19, 2017 at 12:57 PM",1, 2,This has been fixed :)
2022-05-28 16:41:47.221086,MervinRae,Really Cool and Engaging!,"First for the bug the last two reviewers do mention:

The Dev responded yesterday on the steam forum that he will look into it and fix it the same day: ""..sounds like there must be an issue uploading scores to Oculus. Will fix today!"". (It is now fixed!) 

This is really a cool game, looking forward to play it over the next years every now and then : )
The AI is good, the visuals are spacy and Tron-like and the progression is cool when the playfield itself changes to become more difficult. This is a natural fit for VR and the gameplay, as simple it may seem, is more elaborated then you would think and it is a lot of fun. This is no Shovelware it is actually made with deep and effort, and as said, the AI is really good. I haven`t tried multiplayer yet but I think that can be very fun as well. This is a game you can play over the years and so it has a great value. My recommendation! : ) p.s.: I forgott the mention the music which is really great as well (Tron-like 80ies) It is all very atmospheric.","Jun 22, 2017 at 6:23 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:41:47.236046,Innero,"Nice idea, but tracking issues ruin it.","Game feels nice. The main idea is to hit the ball hard. But unfortunately when you do that, the paddle is not being tracked precisely enough to put the ball in any predictable direction. It got old after 30 minues.","Jun 26, 2017 at 5:51 AM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 16:41:50.344731,Microserf2005,My favorite VR workout,"Love this game. It has started crashing for me only here on Oculus (works on Steam), so hopefully they keep fixing both at the same pace!","Jun 4, 2017 at 12:34 AM",4, 1,Should be fixed now.
2022-05-28 16:41:50.360688,hkarrson,Way better in VR.,"You would think that a pong game for $15 sounds like a bit much, but in this case, you'd be surprised. I don't like to workout, but this game is definitely a bit of an exercise. At the same time, it is an extremely engaging and fun game to play. I can see many people getting the hang of this game even if they are trying out VR for the first time, because you only need to know how to use the trigger and how to move your hands, which everyone should know how to do. Definitely worth the money if you want a fun and simple game to get the hang of.","Mar 24, 2017 at 12:34 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:41:50.375648,BobTagab,I Keep Coming Back,"This is probably one of my favorite games for the Oculus, and it's so simple, hit a ball back and forth against a somewhat snide square. I find myself sweating after a while playing this, and eventually coming back again and again to try and just get a few more points in endurance mode. It may get a bit exausting after half an hour of swinging your arms back and forth, but it's fun as hell.","Feb 24, 2017 at 9:00 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:41:50.389611,JoshuaTLand,More addicting than you'd expect!,I picked this game up because it was highly rated and seemed like fun.

2022-05-28 16:41:53.486329,Matahashi,Great game. Needs so QoL things.,"Fun racketball type game. I had some issues with the ball just going in seemingly random directions when ever I go for a hard swing though. Itd also be nice to add an option for only 1 racket instead of always having one in each hand, found myself hitting the ball with the racket in my left hand on accident a couple times. It annoyed me enough that I just put my left touch to the side but that could be why my hard swings were a little weird.","Feb 6, 2017 at 5:10 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 16:41:53.501289,vahdyx,Very fun,"I highly recommend you guys clear more space than you have though. I did punch the crap out of my wall. 

Fast pace game and the only way to play. However I have discovered a sure way to win and I hope the devs work this out in a future update. 

I won't spoil it, but a small hit, ""you don't need to hit the ball back, just ricochet it back""","Feb 6, 2017 at 4:34 AM",4, 0,
