2022-05-28 18:25:17.841929,MisjaKlomp,Beautiful dance experience,"I knew before purchasing this app that it was a short experience, but as a dance enthusiast I'd say it is worth the price. If you are on the fence, however, I would recommend going for the second Firebird experience (The Unfinished), which is less expensive and an even more magical experience. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this and hope that there will be more to follow!","Jul 27, 2020 at 3:43 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:25:17.856889,MarquisDeSang,Give me my money back and my time back,"Ugly graphics, ugli design, not the music in the trailer and it's boring. The only interesting part whas at the end when the game offer you to exit the game. Even 2 years ago, it would not have been good. There are tons of better music/vr experiences that are free or cost 2$. I feel like I have been victime of a scam.","Aug 19, 2017 at 10:28 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:25:17.876836,guruflorida,Ug. I just paid for this?,"Very short for $10, and yet not short enough. I was glad when the curtain fell.","Mar 4, 2017 at 1:04 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 18:25:17.891796,Bel-garath,"Way too short, but very well done","This was a very well put together demo, but in my opinion demos this short shouldn't be more than a dollar or two. I mean we have seen other very well done demos on the GearVR and Rift that are free. Had this been at least 30 minutes long (preferably longer like a movie), something of this quality would be 5 stars. However, the first 3 acts are ok but nothing spectacular with the best act being the last. The last act with its two different endings was amazingly well done. The whole 10-15 was beautiful to look at even if the first 3 acts were a bit sleepy. I'm looking forward to seeing what else like this is created.","Dec 24, 2016 at 10:01 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 18:25:17.906756,bk227865,To short,"Beautifull , but i can't give it 5 stars because the story is soooo short , it's feels like a demo i just payed money for. Also i don't really dig the jumping back and forth between 2 roles.","Jan 28, 2017 at 12:05 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:25:21.033394,nrosko,A glimpse of where VR can take you.,"Ok so it is short, yes, its another one of those VR demos & you think uh i just paid money for a 10min demo. But i think this is very well produced experience with a great deal of effort gone to the presentation. I felt so part of the exprience that this alone has convince me that VR has a big part to play in story telling & animation. I think the developers who created this have done so with passion rather than to make a quick buck from VR. I hope they continue to delve into this new medium & create more feature length experiences in the future.","Dec 24, 2016 at 1:14 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 18:25:21.049351,Rezon8,,Far too short and basic mechanics that are not that interesting to play through.  This is basically a mediocre demo and not really worth the money spent.,"Apr 28, 2017 at 10:39 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:25:21.064310,Polylop,Doesn't work properly on the Rift,"The height setting of the Oculus Rift configulation isn't refelected properly in this experience. It makes some scenes unplayable  for my setup. Just a rough port, not worth the money.","Jan 4, 2017 at 7:57 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:25:21.078273,OliverMcSpinach,A refined story for eyes and mind,"A great VR experience. I would very much like to see more experiences like this. Price seems a bit steep for play time, but a great narrative, refined story and well executed VR interactivity.","Dec 21, 2016 at 9:16 AM",4, 5,
