I so 'do'  love my Gothic atmosphere and this game is my favorite go-to when I am idle or a bit drum ho hum. It is a bit bothersome that there is not more music toggle options. I just love this game dearly. I wish there were more like it. Truly.,"Jun 4, 2019 at 11:27 AM",5, 3,Thank you!!
2022-05-28 13:58:24.418335,aelizacook,Great game!,"Some of the reviews say that you can't play this game with Oculus Touch controllers, but I've not had any problem with the Touch controllers. There's a tiny bit of a learning curve, but I've been able to do everything fine once I spent the few seconds to figure out which buttons did what. The atmosphere is wonderful. The only thing I would say that needs improvement is the music. It's great for a few minutes, but it does get old quickly. I've just turned the volume down and played my own music, and that works fine.","Sep 20, 2018 at 3:28 AM",5, 4,Thank you!!!
2022-05-28 13:58:24.433295,Sl0thz,meh,I guess its ok but they really gotta lose the annoying music.  The death march will drive you nutz after a while. Can't believe you can't change the music to your own liking. Plus seems like its hard to win. Atmosphere is spooky.,"Jul 28, 2018 at 2:22 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 13:58:24.448256,Danbo342,Very unfinished,"You cannot play fully with only Oculus Touch which is very horrid. No possible way to press the restart tab visible during game play and not even clickable with mouse or keyboard.

The song(s), are one and a half songs that continuously loop. There's the death march and something I can't name, but the unknown one has a piano trill that you will start to hear in your sleep because the song list is so insanely short and you will thus be forced to hear it so often.

Very sad really, because this would be awesome otherwise. Great atmosphere and audio but the lack of Touch support and song list makes it awful.

A bonus would be to play your own music. Perhaps a setting to browse to a folder of choice, or have the app have it's own default folder that you could simply drop in your own music.","Apr 14, 2018 at 9:38 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 13:58:24.463215,Alkhemist,,"It's funny to read that others ""can't win a game."" I win about 75% of the time. I have not run into any ""time's up"" issues whatsoever.

I would give this 5 stars if it didn't have the same music over and over. I still play this game quite a lot, but only on mute, which is unfortunate because there are other sounds that would be nice to still hear, like the fireplace or the crow. (Devs, PLEASE change this or make a music-only mute button!)

The little storyline is a nice extra. It adds to the haunted atmosphere. Beautifully done.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves solitaire.","Feb 10, 2018 at 12:58 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 13:58:27.596972,ronmoes80,Shivers...!,"I got some shivers while playing, I won't spoil it but first time in vr i got those and i'm not faint of heart at all. The game looks very visual pleasing and i can't say anyting more than what others have been saying I hope the developer will get an option in the menu to disable the background music all together.  but then again playing with my favorite music isn't bad at all!","Mar 24, 2018 at 12:51 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 13:58:27.625894,SpicyAftermath,,i love the atmosphere. really right down my alley. It really needs the option to turn off the music.,"Mar 1, 2018 at 7:46 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:58:27.641852,Darklasombra,Easy to play and relaxing,"Nice atmosphere, very little activity needed. Only needed one touch controller to navigate. Resetting game was as easy as looking to the right and pressing a button. 
 All I could ask for in solitare. Minus one star only because music got repetative.","Jan 4, 2018 at 5:37 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 13:58:27.655814,becklarae,fun game,"Really fun game, the music gets a little annoying at times, but in the background there are people dancing, and a lady playing the piano. free game, must get.","Dec 31, 2017 at 3:19 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:58:30.753145,superdave132,Almost downloaded a non touch app,"Phew, I almost downloaded a non-touch app that would have caused me to use the horribly broken xbox controller.","Nov 29, 2017 at 2:05 PM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 13:58:30.768106,FastLawyer,Added a star because it's free,"So this game does have flaws.  First of all, I don't know why you couldn't use your touch controllers to move the cards around.  Also, not big on the teleportation around.  It seemed it only really distracted from the game.  The background story with the collectables is obtuse.  It's really the solitaire game we're here for.  Contrary to other reviews, you can win hands of solitaire.  However, you do have to play your cards right and you do need lady luck on your side because you do run out of turns.  Unfortunately, when you win not much happens, other than animations of the cards auto matching.  You then just start a new game and I found that very odd.  I expected more.  Anyways, it's solitaire and it mostly plays fine.  It's slightly more fun than playing on the desktop.","Nov 25, 2017 at 4:31 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 13:58:30.783065,dragonart777,Purgatory,"Purgatory because the same music is played over and over no option to turn it off.

2022-05-28 13:58:30.813489,kingtut_uk,Like the concept.,"Like the concept of moving around a location to play different games. Unfortunately it induces nausea in me, i think, because you have to use both sticks on the gamepad to move. If movement was controlled by one stick then that may reduce the feeling of nausea.","Jun 18, 2017 at 1:44 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 13:58:33.922826,Gatemoon,Great but...,"There's no way to turn off the music only. You either turn off all sound or you have to listen to the same 2 songs forever. They were great the first 10 times, but after that you kinda go insane. It's the only real negative about the game. Otherwise it's really well made and a 5 stars game.","Mar 24, 2017 at 4:48 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 13:58:33.937786,Zephyr92,get touch support,^^^this is pretty much what I say for literally every non-touch vr game...^^^,"Dec 10, 2017 at 1:15 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 13:58:33.952746,jayhawk,Lasted about 1 min.,"Not at all what I expected. I was at least expecting to be able to look select cards, but it's in the G-pad sticks/D-pad side scrolling through the cards to get to the set you want. why? With Touch out now, look select isn't even good enough now though. When this gets Touch control support then it will be worth spending your time on. Good thing I only paid $2","Jan 1, 2017 at 1:58 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 13:58:33.968703,Greyhawk101,Excellent,I dont know if anyone playing thishas discovered but you can get out of your chair and explore the game area. There are story items littered around and all sorts of things happening in the background. Plus different sittings you can use. This is the only game I have so far where you can actually move in first person! The developer needs to expand on the really atmospheric room and storyline into a game of its own. Solitaire is fine but the room for me is the best bit.,"Dec 31, 2016 at 8:44 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 13:58:37.071534,funkiestj,terrible UI,I didn't expect much but I expected to be able to use a head/gaze cursor to move cards.  I expected too much.  Pretty graphics though.  It would be worth the price if they improve the UI,"Nov 6, 2016 at 4:36 AM",1, 6,
