Seriously, this is a well-rounded and versatile music creation app. I've been using it since its debut on SideQuest and am overjoyed it's finally available on the official store for everyone (disclaimer here: I won a free key for the release). You can create your own music, do covers of existing music, and just play around and have fun with no specific end goal in mind. 

It's fun no matter which approach you take. 

The devs are very active, use the app themselves, and listen to their community. And the community is open and friendly and glad to help.

Like the new frames and effects!     I'm a piano player so it's nice to get some different sounds to stretch the imagination.,19 days ago,5, 0,
