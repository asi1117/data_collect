2022-05-28 20:41:34.326777,Muffled,Great game.. need a little improvement.,"First up I want to say this game was a blast because of one reason. Co-op. I played the entire story start to finish with a buddy and it was great, just exploring the subway or riding jetski's but I have one problem. The combat. It is wiggle swords galore and while you may feel feedback it just does not feel right I suggest trying to impliment weight (like twd saints and sinners) so you can feel the impact and to add some difficulty. Also a nice thing would be to maybe add some magazines to the gun (unless they are hidden somewhere) but my point is to maybe expand the guns more because they work pretty well and it was satifying to pop a zombie in the head. But thats it, otherwise this game is amazing and im happy to see act 2.",Mar 28 at 3:21 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:41:34.340740,meteoritecollector,Game needs some improvements,"Controlling needs some time for using and it is not smooth. This is the result of laying the turning and the straight movement on difference joysticks.  No idea how to eat and get healing points. No possbility for saving the game at position, perhaps not found. Game needs some improvements, if these are available the game can be great.
Relatively nice graphic, interesting game line.",Nov 1 at 9:00 PM,2, 6,"Hello ! Thank you for the feedback. To eat and heal, take an item such as a chips bag, and put it where your mouth is. Then release the grip button, the character will eat and heal."
