2022-05-28 19:34:29.392794,Hollywood_TG,"Good Tour, Could Be Better","It's such a tantalizing taste of what could be a great NASA VR experience, however there's some flaws.  If you get into the capsule, you can't exit the program or get back to the menu.  If you are anywhere in the VR experience, you can't exit to the Oculus software.  Would love to just sit in the crew module and flip switches and learn more about the systems.

Also the scale is off from the real world when it comes to your VR experience, everything is much larger than in real life to the eye.  Could do with proper scaling of the view.  Also would have been nice to have the VAB and Saturn V center modeled as well.","Mar 11, 2019 at 9:42 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 19:34:32.520995,ceoroyalt,Great simple tour.,"Nothing special, nice way of having a glimps of what VR is like. There's no interaction in this tour but the views are great!","Jul 1, 2018 at 3:38 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 19:34:32.536952,LKNANML,Download time is longer than play time.,"Takes longer to install that it does to go through it.  While free there just isnt enough content here to make the download worth your time. Edit. I need to add that there ""could"" be a good interactive experience here if they decide to add more content. Maybe something on the mission control side of the house.","May 6, 2018 at 7:38 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:34:32.552910,FolkSong,"Poor VR Design, Very Uncomfortable","This experience uses constant forced movement (eg. the ""camera"" pans and rotates without your input). This makes it pretty uncomfortable in VR, I had to stop after a couple minutes.","Mar 15, 2018 at 11:54 AM",2, 14,

2022-05-28 19:34:35.665717,FastLawyer,VR cinematic about NASA space launch,"This is a VR cinematic experience & the guided complete tour takes about 3 minutes. I thought it was interesting enough.  I recommend this for anyone interested in the space launch to Mars. Keep in mind, this is an educational virtual tour. There is no interaction other than using gaze operation to start the experience and choosing which one you want. There is no game here. I thought the visuals were pretty good. I'm happy I downloaded it, but I will be deleting it after my viewing. BTW, If you get nausea because the camera moves, I would recommend selling your VR headset and not reviewing games on Oculus.","Mar 16, 2018 at 11:22 PM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 19:34:35.681674,Kevin_Brook,Limited content. Very short.,"If you're hoping this is going to be another MIssion ISS level experience from Nasa, then prepare for disappointment. There's about three minutes of content, all non interactive. This kind of stuff gets me annoyed with Oculus. Not because it's so bad I wish I hadn't downloaded it, it was moderately interesting. 
However now it will be forever linked to my account and even though I can uninstall it, I can't ever remove it from my list of currently uninstalled titles. As it's now full of sub 5 minute garbage now this becomes annoying and makes me hesitant to download anything free any more.","Mar 16, 2018 at 8:31 AM",2, 9,
