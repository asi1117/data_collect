2022-05-28 15:53:18.725748,7diracseas,,Easily the best game on the oculus store.,"May 24, 2020 at 7:57 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:53:18.741705,Mirality,,"A great read, and a satisfying conclusion, even with some stumbles along the way (could have used more proofreading -- one of the bad endings is absolutely terribly translated, although the rest of the game is decent, with just the odd typo here and there).

Note that for the full experience you have to play the game completely through twice.  The second run is almost, but not quite, the same as the first.  The differences are important.","Jan 7, 2020 at 5:44 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 15:53:18.758660,FFLight,First Vr Visual Novel,"Completed in 20hours, spent at least 6 hours at a time playing.
Super engaging and thrilling story about a bunch a kids. (I'd like to forget just so I could replay it again.)
 Few translations errors  but no big deal.","Sep 21, 2019 at 1:59 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:53:18.773620,Daughter.LAN,Great Narrative Game!,"Pretty deep story and some great designs! Especially like the puppet memories! Scale of characters and areas could use some work, felt like I was surrounded by giants. Wrote a 25 pharagraph review covering the whole story and messed up my sleep schedule for this game because I wanted to know how it ended so bad! 4/5 gonna play more of your stuff!","Apr 19, 2019 at 5:10 AM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 15:53:21.900257,RikkaKami,Great for VN fans,If you are into visual novels this is for you. The only issue I have with this game is f* up feeling of scale and distance.,"Apr 1, 2019 at 5:46 AM",5, 28,
