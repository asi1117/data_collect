2022-05-28 15:54:22.257823,dz1000,Mindblowing,"Graphics are amazing.  One of the most memorable experiences I have ever had in VR.  

The only downer is that the maps where I live are several years out of date and some less populated areas don't look as good as they should and are missing the street view data even though it is present in the flat screen version. 

I am not going to deduct points for these shortcomings though as the overall experience is still mind-blowing on Quest 2.",25 days ago,5, 16,
2022-05-28 15:54:22.272782,TenTonTITAN,You CAN play this on your Quest / Quest2,"Just plug your Quest into your PC using the USB cable (or a longer one off Amazon) and when the notification to enable Oculus link comes up, just click 'yes' and now you're in Oculus Home and you can play any PC game you want, including GEVR. If the notification doesn't come up, just open your quick settings in your Quest and ""Oculus Link"" will be one of the options. Right now it's the big square on the right.

REVIEW:
After 5.5 years - Google Earth VR is still hands-down my fav app. You want content? Try the ENTIRE PLANET. I visit Japan on a weekly basis and spent 100's of hours there and found so much cool stuff - but still haven't even scratched the surface. I really wish Google would do more with this but even if they don't, it's still incredible and will never get old.",Jan 2 at 3:51 AM,5, 204,

I dont know if this is a thing but google should advertise for free contributors, I myself hold my own unpublished elevations of many buildings and sites that are shown in 2d texture within the maps, google should welcome and show to welcome input (from sketchup users would be easy to vet too).

The connection to Street view ist also great, especially for those areas that aren't very detailed from above.
My advice: When you want to check out a certain area/city, try not to use the search function. Try to get there on your own just by ´""flying"" there. You'll discover a lot of great places on the way!

2022-05-28 15:54:44.442486,HelloAlice2019,"Personally, my favorite VR experience!","I am in my mid-30's. Lived in Russia, France and United States (Brooklyn, Queens, Upstate NY). Traveled to many places for vacations and mountain climbing, so I have quite a few fading memories. And boy, did VR Google Maps revive those memories! I feel silly writing this, but I got really emotional revisiting some of the places I lived in and visited as a kid and young adult.

This app is incredible as it can let you travel the world in a doll-house mode format, but also dive right into the streets as if you are there. However, in my opinion it is much more powerful as a tool for revisiting where you lived and traveled to in the past than locations you have never visited before. I honestly did not expect to get as emotional as I did the first few times I tried it. 

To the creators, thank you for this experience :)","Mar 15, 2021 at 10:59 AM",5, 142,

Why not implement the user interface from apps like 3D modelers, like in example Gravity Sketch?
Two hands to zoom in and out, and to position it (pan).
One hand on the globe to rotate it.
That would be SO much more intuitive than all this point and click and drag.
Apart this, the flying mode is cool, but also this could be made more natural and comfortable.

The only way to see landmarks, tags, streets, town names, and so on is if you are looking directly down on things like a regular map. If you go into the MAIN REASON for this app, the VR 3D model type view where you can fly around... they take out all the markers.

You fly around, ""Oh cool, what is that?"" or ""Where is this cool looking place?"" you have to go to the other view looking straight down on the globe. When you change views, it can shift so your not where you were, and flipped the views (mainly using that straight down globe type view) makes me motion sick really badly. Just leave the tags and markers on things when in the VR fly around 3D view, thats all, and this app would be PERFECT!!

I could see our little umbrella in the backyard, and could put my head on the ground to look under the front porch overhang to see our front door. This was a staggering and very moving experience ... I hadn't expected anything more than tiny little blotches for each house. Wow!

When my wife came home I had setup Google Earth VR to be above our neighborhood then put the headset on her and asked her to find our house. She followed the streets around and could pinpoint it. I asked her if she could see our backyard. No, no, she couldn't see that much detail. I told her to get closer. ""What do you mean?"" she said. ""How would I do that?"" I told her to get down on her hands and knees. ""What? Really?"" But she did ... and then, ""Hey! That's my car in the driveway!

I haven't tried to figure out if there are ways of pointing at something and finding out details, or getting into Street View mode, but I'm excited to find out what else this app can do!

Not sure what I was expecting other than the typical street view that you would expect see from a web browser, it's so much more than that....

When you first boot up the app you’re presented with the tutorial on how to move around using your controllers, this guide was so easy to understand, and they have gone for a basic approach meaning that you can be jumping from city to city in seconds. 

Once I'd found my global wings then came the menu with pre-set famous locations, I like that they are set into categories and there's plenty to choose from.

Loving the fact it’s mostly a 3D surrounding which is packed full with detail; it really gives you a good sense of scale in terms of the size of the earth.

I was also impressed when I accidently went off track and found you could plonk yourself anywhere in the world not just the pre-set locations in the menu, soon I was off to visit my house also rendered as a 3D model,  the whole town was amazing and I'm honestly left speechless.

If you are flying around, dont get too close to things, then you loose the quality, for example getting close to a tree it looks horrible, you cant complain though when they are trying to map the whole planet in 3d you cant expect to see individual tree branches, (not yet anyway). You can also go into street view. The scaling isnt quite right in most pictures, eg, you are scaled to big or small for the image, but thats likly just down to of the different camera used and uploads from the public.

This is simply amazing. Just when you first see the whole planet in front of you, then you zoom in and the planet becomes huuuge spanning horizons. Then you visit a 3D scanned city and... are you familiar with those fake miniature city photos (tilt shift photography)? This is just like it in 3D. A roomfull of beatiful model city made of tiny boxes. And then, streetview. Although it is not truly stereoscopic 3D and you are at a wrong height (Street View car cameras are too high above walking person level), it is again another amazing experience, it looks completely different than Street View on the PC screen and the ambience noise make it just like if you were there.
Interesting that such a ""stupid"" app (this is massive downplay of the engineering and organizational feats behind even having the data in the first place) that shows photos from a street next door can bring more excitement than shooting robots on another planet in the future!

Some are sad that the mankind is not sending people to the Moon anymore, not even mentioning other planets. We don't need to. Just send a 3D scanning probe, make ""Google Mars VR"" with the quality of this and millions of people could experience it instead of one bloke phoning home ""yes, I am here"".

Yes, there are issues, the controls become unhandy at times (e.g. a rotation moving you centered at a point in the world instead of rotation moving the world centered at you would improve navigation), a lot of cities are not photographed in 3D in smaller countries, but this is still the coolest experience in a while.","Oct 11, 2019 at 6:53 AM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 15:55:50.744153,Chakalee,I am awestruck,"This app is the Eighth Wonder of the World as far as I’m concerned.  Much different from the Wander app available on the Go and Quest.  In this app, you're in a 3D world where you can fly around like Superman, checking out all sorts of famous places, natural wonders, old neighborhoods, vacation locales - you name it.  Fly in for a close view, or fly up for a big picture view.  All in 3D.  Trust me, you will spend HOURS using this.  Zoom in really close, bring your left hand up to your face, and you are immediately transported into Google Street View.  Otherwise, everything is rendered in a shockingly cool computerized 3D that makes it seem like you’re looking at an intricately constructed model of the locale you’re viewing.  

Want to see how your home looks from a height of a few hundred feet up (or a few thousand)?  Just fly up and check it out.  Want to zoom over the Colorado River as it passes through the Grand Canyon, with the canyon walls towering above you - go ahead and do it, nobody's stopping you.  Or fly down between city buildings and you’ll see a pristine version of reality, complete with miniature models of street signs, billboard advertisements, traffic lights, and even cracks in the street concrete.  Honestly, sometimes it’s a disappointment to switch from the rendered 3D environment over to the real world Street View perspective.  

Others have complained that the app can be improved in this way or that, and I’m sure there’s room to improve on plenty of things, but let’s be honest - this app is flat out amazing.","Jul 10, 2019 at 1:58 PM",5, 23,

Every time we take the Oculus Rift out, they ask me to choose this ""game"".  It is quite interesting and educational. My main goal for purchasing Oculus Rift was VR traveling and definitely not shooting or slaying monsters and zombies.  While the graphic level is better than my Everest VR, if it were just another little bit better, this game would be almost as good as real traveling without the need of dealing with airports, sweating with luggage, delayed flights, missed connections, etc.  Also, I hope that, over time, the number of cities  and locations that one can visit is going to grow, although the selection is not bad as is already. There is no application/game for Oculus Rift that is worth 5-star ratings yet, in my opinion, this would be the only one I would assign the 5-stars if only it were possible to get closer to objects and experience a tad more details. However, the ability to change the relative size of viewer and objects is enticing. Sometimes I take a stroll through the streets of famous cities that I have visited in the past. I find cities more exciting than some natural parks. For example, today I was hiking inside Bryce Park in Utah and the graphics did not feel really natural, the polygonal nature of details was too evident and I was not able to feel like I was really there, a park that I have visited several times in the past and in real life.  If the accuracy of details were allowed to be really fine to the point that one could look inside buildings, this application would be mesmerizing. Still. a solid 4-star ratings, one of the rare such ratings I feel like assignining. Plus it is free. If the level of details increased by a notch to, say UHD, I would not even mind paying $30-40 for it. Most other games I purchased, never really felt like money well spent. Google Earth VR would be the exception.","Jan 1, 2019 at 6:19 AM",4, 9,

I was trying to hold in my nostalgia and childhood memories from walking around my neighborhood and trying to get as much detail as I could of the enviornment. Even for something as lowpoly and low textured, it was enough to click the right spots in my brain to make me feel nostalgic. I wish only but more detail and improvement on the app, maybe a better camera feature other than the save location, I would also like to see pictures uploaded to Google Photos and automatically aligned to the position they're taken to help with the perspective.

Lots of people say VR needs a killer app, but what if I told you there was one? I'm talking about Google Earth VR. Now, I know what you're thinking, Google Earth is VR's killer app? While the desktop version is pretty cool, it doesn't blow me away like the VR version. In virtual reality, it will make your jaw drop.

Google Earth VR still uses the desktop version's satellite imagery, but in VR, you'll feel like you're flying around the world. Much of the planet is rendered in 3D using photogrammetry, which helps induce a sense of ""presence,"" or the feeling like you're really there. If you’ve never used the desktop version, you’d think Google Earth was built from the ground up for VR. I personally feel a bit like Superman as I soar through the sky and observe the vast expanse of the Milky Way around me. Enabling the app’s human-scale mode allows you to zip down into the nooks and crannies below. 

Google Earth VR excels at allowing you to see familiar places in a new light. People have also inadvertently stumbled across more efficient routes getting home using the app. 

It’s not perfect, though, and it’s definitely no replacement for actually visiting real-world locations. Its biggest flaw is that when you get really low into the streets, it starts to look a bit, well, post-apocalyptic. This is because Google doesn’t have enough low-level data from its satellite imagery. There are also some places, like Iceland and Columbia, that aren’t completely rendered in 3D. You end up with a 3D-mapped topology of the landscape, without any of the buildings or city infrastructure. 

But when Google Earth VR works, it soars. One aspect of the app that probably wasn't originally intended was its power to induce a tremendous sense of nostalgia. In a way, Google Earth VR is a time machine. It captures a snapshot of the world frozen in a moment. Waves on the ocean and cars on the road appear in a state of suspended animation.","Jul 28, 2018 at 11:47 AM",5, 17,

With the street view I was standing in the middle of my culdisac looking at my parents house, before my dad died. I saw his car sitting in the driveway and knew that when the picture was taken he was sitting inside the house. I know it's just a picture, but being able to see my old house in a virtual setting, with the concept that my dad was just on the other side of the walls I was staring right at, it overwhelmed me quickly.

You can fly over and visit your cherished places (including street views if available there),
The 3d modeling of big cities is so high quality that you can fly over it at low altitude and enjoy as if you were there (upon your internet speed, leave some seconds to download the 3d meshes of objects), 
Also, the 3d altimetry of most of the mountains allow you to fly right over or in between to admire the beauty of the landscape.
This is a very nice way to discover a place where you may travel later, thus having a ''pre-minded'' map of the places you want to visit.

When you're in Street View on the browser, you can click on the pic and move along the street. In this, you get a street view, but you must leave street view in order to get to the next part.

2022-05-28 15:58:03.878068,LuluViBritannia,"No, you're not dreaming!","When I saw Google Earth had a VR version, I thought : ""Ok, cool, but that's certainly something I'll try five minutes and then leave  behind..."". So, I didn't bother to download it.
Then I saw the marks and the critics here on the Oculus Store. ""Wow, is it really that awesome? Better check it out then!"", I thought.

So, I tried it... ""Oh.MY.God! How could I not try this earlier?"". I was amazed!

So, this may seem strange, but yeah, Google Earth is definitely among the BEST VR experiences you can get!

This software works just like the normal one : you travel through the 3D model of the world. Except it's in VR : your ""character"" can be put at human scale, then you can get besides the monuments of the world and feel it almost like you were really there!

The movements are awesome : you fly like Superman. Either you stay on the ground and feel the place like you were driving an invisible car, or you fly up in the air. You can even switch between two ""modes"" : either you're ON Earth and fly all around, or you're IN SPACE and make the Earth turn. This moment when you switch from one mode to another... really, I can't express how awesome that was. Like you suddenly lose (or regain) gravity. This is something to live. Definitely.

Besides, StreetView really shows its full potential in VR. I mean, like it was MADE for it.
StreetView allows you to see 360 photos of many places. But on a flatscreen, well... you probably know what this does : sure that's cool, but not really immersive as you move around with the mouse. In VR, the photo is AROUND YOU, and it really gives the sensation that you are there!

Now, the quality of the models and the pictures vary from one place to another. That's because of the nature of this project : it never stops improving.

So, if you hesitate : don't worry, try it out! BUT don't forget to change a bit the settings, to have human size.

Anyway, I can't wait for Google to implement other planets and satellites in this!","Oct 22, 2017 at 1:22 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:58:07.097457,CashTime,This changes everything,"I adored this app even before street view was added, but anticipated that adding streetview would elevate the experience to the next level. It has indeed done just that. I have never experienced such awe from any technology, nor did I ever expect to. Try going back to places you grew up in. Go to places you have travelled to, landmarks you've been to. Explore the place you are living in right now, and it's like going back in time a few years to when the 360 photo was taken.. 
These can be very intense emotional experiences.. It all seems incredibly surreal.
I come from a place with snowy winters..  Usually when I would view streetview there, it would be summer, but then i would move down the road a bit, and sure enough it would be winter, and you experience a whole different snow-covered landscape. 'Visceral awe' is not in any way exaggerating the profundity of the experience. 
 
This, to me, is why VR exists. Not just to play games and have fun and socialize, but to experience the ""real world"" from your living room.
There are still a few tweaks that need to be made, most importantly so the user can hop around quicker to the next adjacent street view without going back in to the satellite worldview map..  once that is added, we are all in for an even bigger treat (Developers please work on this!)

*If you're looking for a suggestion of a place to explore, my recommendation is Skellig Michael, a chain of islands in south Ireland. You may recognize the landscape if you are in to Star Wars :)","Oct 24, 2017 at 1:34 AM",5, 3,

It lets me fly through streets of cities I've visited in the past and on other continents.
2 annoyances though:
1: Why can't we use the stick to rotate left and right? It would make flying so much easier so you don't have to rotate your head or body anymore. Try flying in a circle with the current input controls and you'll physically have to rotate 360 degrees.
2: Why no Exit or Quit button?
When I press the Oculus menu button and force it to go to Home, Google Earth usually doesn't shut down properly and I'm getting a warning that it can give performance issues.
How difficult can it be to add a Quit button to the menu? I'm not sure why so many VR apps don't have one...","Aug 6, 2017 at 10:53 PM",4, 2,

Secondly there's no street view which is a shame, you can go to street level but everything looks like a ps1 era game.
 
Finally (this is my biggest complaint) nothing looks to scale, it's like flying over a model city rather than an actual city, you can be about a hundred meters up but rather than feeling like you are that high looking down on an actual city you feel as if you are looking at a model city from a few feet away,  untill you fly right up close where you can actually see the perspective change from a minature to full sized which is actually quite trippy.","Jul 24, 2017 at 10:45 AM",3, 0,

The way this app mitigates motion sickness is great as well.

For all of you who expiriencing an immediate crash by starting (or for whome the program won't start at all) - it is probably because your computer is using nvida optimus technologies (so it has two graphic cards). To make it work you have to go to youre program folder - select Oculus/Software/Software/google-inc-goolge-earth-vr, right click on earth and select with which graphic card you want to run the program (which has to be youre dedicated high performance card - most likely nvidia 1060/70 !!!). Then start the program from within the explorer window - everything should work fine and as expected. Good luck and enjoy. UPTADE: To save yourself the work of navigating to the program directory - you can also change the settings directly in the graphiccard settings(3d control)! Just select Earth VR and assign it to the nvidia processor. From now on you should be able to start it normally from within your occulus homescreen !"

Let's figure out why it is not starting for you. We need you to do two things:

1. Can you share the results of the Oculus Log Gatherer? It can be found at ""C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics\OculusLogGatherer.exe""

2. Once you have the log, can you try re-run Earth VR after you install the latest graphics drivers?

Please e-mail me results at perk@google.com"
