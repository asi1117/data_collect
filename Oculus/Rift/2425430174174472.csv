2022-05-28 19:32:13.275225,R2-3PO,Great trippy fun...,"This is an excellent visualizer.  Once you figure out how to make things work, sky's the limit.  You can have colors flying in all around you.  Really depends on what you're looking for.  Run your favorite playlist and have it sync to your music.  It's a very good way to chill and let your medicinals do their magic, lol.","Aug 30, 2020 at 3:48 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:32:13.291183,kame00,Great Music Visualizer,"I've tried other physics/partical simulator but this is one of the best. The UI is very simple and clean, yet does not lack in features. The tutorial is short because it's so easy to use, yet you can place objects that will playback your recorded motion so the experiments are endless.

I stumbled upon this simulator in search of a music visualizer, which I was not expecting much since it's not sold as such. But using the ""Audio Reactivity"" feature, you can use music players such as iTunes, to influence the animation speed. Turns out it's so much more stunning and mesmerizing than most dedicated VR visualization apps, at least in my opinion; granted that's a matter of taste. If you just want to chill with music and not mess with mind-bending physics, no sweat, just load presets and you don't have to think or do anything.

Whether you're looking for a physics simulator or just chilling with lovely music, or looking to explore your artistic side despite completely lacking such abilities like me, you'll be amazed what wonder PARTICULATE can do for you! One of my best purchases on the Oculus Store.","May 11, 2020 at 5:13 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:32:13.306142,mirrorman22,Speechless,This is one of the most fascinating VR experiences I've seen yet...  Beautiful.  Its incredible how mesmerizing this app is.  Wonderful work to any and all involved in making this one happen.,"Feb 7, 2020 at 2:46 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:32:13.322099,hilightnotes,Really engaging/pleasing - recommended!,"When it comes to VR 'particle physics sandboxes', I'd tried Chroma Lab, but couldn't get into it. Particulate, right from the get go, has a really comfy and engaging tutorial. And it feels GREAT. The UI is very well designed and feels easy to use in VR, and the tutorial immediately draws out creativity from the user, teaching them to create exciting particle streams all around them.

It might seem strange to get excited about a ""particle physics sandbox"". It's neither what we'd traditionally think of when we think of a 'game', nor is it what most would think of when we think 'art' or 'creative tool'. But through Particulate I've learned that this 'particle physics sandbox' concept is a unique and beautiful experience. It's its own genre of creative tools, accessible to anyone who enjoys 'playing with things', with its own kinds of expressive and experiential possibilities.

The tools themselves are really cool! It can really feel nice creating interesting 'particle art' or set-pieces and being among it (you're in VR, remember!). There's a variety of interesting tools to manipulate the particles, as well as a recording system to record movements with your tools so you can set up some interesting dynamic scenes.

There's definitely ways it can be improved upon. The 4 stars (instead of 5) is probably because I'm a very critical reviewer when it comes to creative apps xD I'm always thinking about features that could be improved or added! But what's here already is great, engaging, and easily recommendable. 

The priorities of my personal hopes are for the music visualization aspect (yes that's in it too!) to be improved. Right now it's kind of a subdued effect in my experience.","Dec 18, 2019 at 1:56 PM",4, 5,Thanks for the review and detailed thoughts! You've touched on a lot of what I was going for with this app. Making the audio reactive component more dynamic (while still retaining the general character of scenes) is on my list.
2022-05-28 19:32:13.338057,Borenberg,Fails at launch with Pimax,Getting ovr_CommitTextureSwapChain error when starting game and it shuts down. Could possibly have to do with that I'm using a Pimax 5K + and launching from Pitool. I'm not one of those who give 1 star because of a technical issue. I'm sure from what I've read that the game is amazing when it runs Ok.,"Dec 26, 2019 at 4:46 AM",5, 0,"Hey, sorry for the trouble here. I haven't tested with Pimax/Pitool. Please email mike@miketuritzin.com and I can see if I can figure out a fix. Also totally fine to request a refund!"
2022-05-28 19:32:16.469302,gomesh1977,Amazingly Beautiful,"As I'm working on my PhD in Design Art focusing on Virtual Reality as the medium for New Media Art, my aim is to explore the aesthetics of VR art form. I've been utilizing TiltBrush, Oculus Medium, Oculus Quest and Tvori to create different VF art pieces. Each program has its own place in my heart and all of them are being used for my PhD disseration exploration. A few months back I was planning to hire a company to construct me a particle based art program for my disseration but was busy on other things. (Thanks to that) A week ago, I came across this program and immediately purchased it. After I installed it and played for a fe hours....I realized It's pretty much what I was lookign for.  The program's simple, intuitive, and very elegant.  On top of that Mike, the developer, is super kind and very  responsive to my suggestions. As I have a few ideas and suggestions that could make the program very usable for artists especially very beneficial to my PhD tests, he listened and replied back with confident that those issues will be addressed. I'm so lookign forward to seeing this program evolve and become another top-notch art app. Kudos to Mike..the developer.","Nov 7, 2019 at 7:01 PM",5, 9,"Hey Gomesh, it is great to hear Particulate is useful for your art! Thanks for the feedback. I'm collecting feedback right now from people using the app for art to see what changes will make the biggest impact."
2022-05-28 19:32:16.485259,Artist3d,Galactic creator!,"Congratulations on presenting us with an excellent creative tool, yet another in a panorama of efforts to optimize the use of virtual reality's unique spacial environments for artists and builders working in this new, parallel multi-verse. I can see I am going to dive into this one and once again realize that we are indeed riding the crest of a wave of creative potential that knows no bounds. If you can incorporate a simple 8192 X 8192 over/under stereoscopic screenshot option to save our creations  to use and incorporate into our projects that would sweet. Maybe adding a particulate scaling option for a size-range of particles would be nice? but hey! Thanks Mike for a truly experiential creative application in the great tradition of InMedium TiltBrush and other VR tools that we find so useful.","Nov 21, 2019 at 4:01 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:32:16.501216,pinckneyb,Fun but Siloed,It’s possible to make mesmerizing patterns in this app—but there’s no way to show them to anyone else. Would it be possible to implement the ability to shoot 2D video or (even better) 360-degree video? Something like the output you can create with Tilt Brush. It would great to be able to make everything but the particles invisible and then make dreamlike music videos in 360.,"Nov 3, 2019 at 4:50 AM",4, 5,"Hey, thanks for the review! I like the idea of sharing 360 video, I am going to look into what Tilt Brush is doing. (And an option to hide everything but the particles is coming soon. (UPDATE: this is released!))"
2022-05-28 19:32:16.515179,ReinBijlsma,"Mesmerizing, but with some defects","I just bought this software to experiment ( as I do creating VR art  in Tilt Brush ) and to check if i could use scenes I created in other programs.  
Unfortunately there's no option to export videos yet, in 4K and 360 degree. I really hope that this function will be added in future updates, because it would add so much to the possibilities and it will allow others to watch what you're creating. 
Being left handed I also miss an option to switch controllers from right to left.","Nov 21, 2019 at 3:01 AM",3, 6,"Hi, thanks for the feedback! I am going to be taking a closer look at options for exporting. As for being left-handed, in the menus you can press a button on either controller to make it the primary (it defaults to right). The tutorial will use whatever controller was set to primary in the main menu. When in particle scenes, both controllers operate the same way."

In YouTubeVR search ""OPEN PC Reviews"" then select the channel icon (it's of an eclipse), then select PLAYLISTS and on the ""3D VIDEOS"" playlist you will find it there! It's extremely fun and mesmerizing!","Jan 30, 2020 at 11:05 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:32:19.616475,Nephtyz,Particule Sandbox,Particulate really shows that the possibilities in VR are endless. Who would've thought that controlling millions of particules in realtime would be so fun!? Everything in Particulate is well thought out and it's pretty easy to create amazing scenes. Just wish we could share them with others!,"Nov 12, 2019 at 7:48 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:32:19.631941,Echo12mm,Wonderful Art Game,"I absolutely love this game. I'm not the most creative type, but I had a ton of fun just moving the particles and making them react in different ways and change color. My personal favorite was to use the attract tool, gather a bunch of particles into a small ball and then repel them. It was like stars expanding, and was an awesome experience. It was a fantastic time and I can't wait to see what people come up with and create!","Nov 6, 2019 at 11:59 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:32:19.646901,yoogyart,very cool App,"its a lot of fun to play with the particles. Very relaxing and meditative.
Have a lot of Potential., i think. 
Maybe a Import Funktion for Obj,FBX and Png would be great .
The Particles can than flow around ...
And  transparent Mirrows to reflect the Particles... 
and a better Colormixer to change the Colors better.
And maybe a Bunch of Brushlike Alphas where the Particles come from in different Colors - i think about TiltBrush or Flame Painter.
And a Screenshot and Videooption ;-)
Hm- the Soundreaction could be a bit better ;-)
A very very cool App, that make a lot aof Fun. Gratulation to the Developer. :-) :-) Go on this way","Nov 9, 2019 at 10:22 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:32:19.662859,RocketMan9300,Great creative fun,"I've had a lot of fun with this game so far. It is simple but does not get repetitive because there is always a constellation of objects to be found, that will generate an entirely new scene. The controls are well thought through although I would like to be able to adjust the parameters of the placed object ones they are in the scene. Adjusting the intensity of the particle spawners with the trigger for instance, while placing them in the right angle is difficult sometimes. Maybe a sort of ""adjustment tool"" for placed objects where you can readjust the size, intensity etc. using sliders would be nice.

I have not encountered any bugs and would highly recommend this game, especially considering the price.","Nov 3, 2019 at 5:19 PM",5, 3,"Thanks for the review, glad you are liking the app! I have thought about adding a way to tweak tools (other than repositioning) after you place them. Will have to think if there's a good way to add that which doesn't add too much UI complexity. Appreciate the suggestions."
2022-05-28 19:32:19.678816,3DeMan,,"I have tried quite a few particle simulators in VR by now, and this is the best of them. 
4 stars (for me) means - definatly worth a buy, if this sort of thing interests you - If (like me) you are bored of shooting zomies in the head - it should interest you too. You will be surprised at how much time you can loose just messing around in creative 360 particle environments. 
Presentation is very slick and it shifts a lot of particles around withour breaking into a sweat.

One thing needs to be fixed - as others have pointed out - you need to be able to make the tools invisble (really there is no need to have the two controllers mapped out the same - have one controler as the primary, and use the other conroller for different functions - i.e. swaping hands, toggling the tools and little particle emitter  tubes off and on etc). Otherwise, it is like making a painting and stepping back to look at it, with the paint tubes and brushes still stuck to the canvas. The dev seems active and engaged, so I expect this to be fixed by the time you read this. 

That is the only thing that *needs* to be fixed - onto the wish list. 
It is nice to play your own music whilhe messing around - however, the particles do not seem that reactive to the actual music. I would like to see this aspect ramped up a notch or two - have the particles pulse more with the beat of the music - have the colours change according to (errr) another algorythm (example in DMT music visualiser, or Milkdrop visualiser from back in the day). 
A larger range of colous and tones would be good too - or have the colours of the particles mix when they collide. 

These two are from my personal wish-list - if they do not get implimented, the app is still very good and I will be spending more time in it for sure. 

Recommended for all those VR users who like to explore somethnig beyond the obvious.","Nov 4, 2019 at 12:29 AM",4, 2,"I was aiming to make the ultimate VR particle app, so glad you are liking it! Making tools invisible is coming soon (UPDATE: this is released!). I made the two hands duplicates with the goal that it would make real time ""performances"" easier, but yeah, not super useful when taking your time to build a scene.

I am likely going to add a setting for audio reactivity sensitivity (and possibly juice it up a bit more as well). Audio reactivity is most noticeable right now with that has distinctive beats like electronic music (with it you often get really cool stop-start particle motion)."
2022-05-28 19:32:22.771618,woozie77,Amazing creative app,"Didnt know that manipulating particles can be such a chilling and mezmerizing experience :) The particle engine is impressive, controls are polished and proven (similar to TiltBrush and SculptrVR) and it features audio reactive mode working with any source. I give 4 Stars due to rather basic feature set, but i'm sure the developer will add more stuff over time. Personally i'd like to see community scene sharing and auto-mode for music visualization, it would easily be a 5-star app then","Nov 1, 2019 at 1:50 AM",4, 2,"Thanks for the review! Outside audio originally was auto-detected, but I had to turn that off when adding sound effects and music to the app (because they triggered the detection). I am going to dig further at the Windows API level to see if I can differentiate audio sent to the same device.

(And also I do want to add community scene sharing if that is a highly requested feature.)"
2022-05-28 19:32:22.786578,jamesdg,Beautiful and Relaxing,I have really been enjoying this app. It's great to relax with at the end of the day.

After ,when You using a lot of manipulators that is a little bit annoying to see them. But nice!","Nov 1, 2019 at 9:37 PM",5, 1,"Thanks for the review! I have had a bunch of requests now to be able to make the tool spheres and other shapes invisible, so I am going to add that option (UPDATE: this is released!).

Being aware of fluid dynamics across scales is a wonderful way to feel connected with nature and the cosmos. The VR software Particulate from Mike Turitzin is the perfect tool to build the bridge between nature and VR. This powerful tool helped me to understand and feel the forces at play, building amazing patterns you can create in virtual reality and find in the physical world. I deeply recommend Particulate for digital artists who want to integrate the dynamics of particles in their art and connect technology with the Earth in a positive way.","Nov 12, 2019 at 6:51 PM",5, 1,
