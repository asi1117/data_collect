2022-05-28 19:38:18.972316,uftar,Funny game,"Not perfect (that's why I give it 4 stars) but really funny little game. It's like a mix between Elven Assassin and killing minecrafters instead of monsters. Several scenaries and stress increasing. Don't expect marvellous graphics (I must say I like this cartoony squared-head style) nor perfect mecanics but, for the price, I think it is a very good option if you like defend tower games and bows. Surprisingly enjoyable","Mar 18, 2020 at 8:32 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:38:18.987277,ktaylor2,Very entertaining,"It's really fun when you figure out how to play effectively. Sure, it's hard to hit the target every time when you shoot an arrow, but that's part of the challenge. You learn very quickly how to adjust your aim.  The controls are good and feel very natural. The only downside is my arm gets tired holding the bow. I can't fault the game for that, it's on me. It's a fun game and I recommend it.","Feb 7, 2020 at 10:31 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:38:19.002744,Basvdd,,"Nice game, stressful as it should be, simple in design, which I like.

Just getting really frustrated over grabbing the arrow, which seems to work everywhere, except near the bow. If you make a mistake, you have to realize, move your hand away from the bow and back, this takes too long. Further, it feels weird to release the arrow and immediately hold the trigger down again, like reversed gun shooting.","Dec 2, 2019 at 9:25 PM",3, 4,"Hi thanks for the review! There's an option in the game settings to use the quiver when spawning arrows which forces you to reach back over your shoulder for the next arrow, which you may find more intuitive. However with that option disabled (which it sounds like you have) you're able to spawn arrows anywhere except too near to the bow. This is by design and simply to stop the player from arrow spamming. Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 19:38:19.018701,chais82,"Game is fun, when it works","Only had the game for 5 days, worked for 2 of those days. Ever since, I go into the game and all the scores are zero. When I try to enter a level it spawns me in a random spot on the map. Nothing else loads. Just sits there, Too bad because its a very addicting game.

I wrote this two days ago, no response and still cant access the game. I looked for a direct contact for help, but I was not able to locate anyone. Why isnt it easier to reach out to the developers? :(

Edit: Thank you for your response! I was not able to get back here to follow up until now. I ended up uninstalling the game. Then re-installed it. Its been working ever since. I do really enjoy this game. Great job!","Oct 26, 2019 at 10:31 AM",5, 2,"Hi, sorry to hear you're having trouble with Keep Defending. To be honest, I'm unsure what is causing the problems you describe. Keep Defending spawns the player in a set start position for each level, there is no random placement in effect at all.

The fact that the game worked fine for a couple of days, and then has had trouble since, maybe indicates a change to your setup? Could you try running the Oculus setup procedure again, particularly the guardian floor/height positioning part of it?

The scores/leaderboards are fetched from the Oculus platform in the level select scene. If they are zero then that might indicate either an internet connection issue, or again, maybe the Oculus software on your PC might not be functioning right - please run through the setup procedure.

I'm awaiting Oculus to update the website links in the game's description, however please visit http://www.fastertimegames.com/kd for social media links (to contact me directly via FB or Twitter etc).

Unfortunately devs aren't notified when a new review is posted on the Oculus store, so it's more a case of us having to remember to check regularly. In my defence: it was the weekend! :) Apologies for the delay responding.

Edit: Glad to hear you've managed to fix things and are enjoying the game! Many thanks for updating your review - that's greatly appreciated!"
2022-05-28 19:38:19.034659,eerforce1,Oculus Rift Please Help,"Sorry , My bad.  All good... just need to follow  the directions LOL



Game starts , however I Cannot  use my Oculus Rift controllers.   I see a pair of hands but nothing is recoginzed when I try to  point or squeeze triggers.  The only thing that works is teleport. I recalibrated my controllers / room steup but no luck.","Oct 15, 2019 at 5:41 AM",5, 1,"Hi, sorry to hear you're struggling with Keep Defending. I'm guessing you're trying to move in the level select scene? If so then you can use the thumbstick to activate the teleport, or press the controller triggers and swing your arms to walk forward. Hope that's okay? Thanks for trying the game! :)"
2022-05-28 19:38:22.154924,Wigleow,Love it,"The game is beautiful, you get to do some exercise, and when you have a bad day, it is a good way to vent. 

I had a lot of fun and it has good replayability. I hope the game does well enough for the developer to add more units or maps or whatever, or even release a new game. 

Give a try!","May 20, 2019 at 3:39 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:38:22.170881,BigwoofGames,honestly seems like a very great game,"but it just doesnt work. when you try to move it gets very clunky and just teleports or freezes for a second. cant even start the level. doesnt show you how to shoot, and i couldnt figure it out","May 23, 2019 at 9:34 AM",1, 0,"Hi, sorry to hear you're having serious problems! There's an information panel in the start area with basic control information, and it's recommended you try the first level (called ""Homestead"") to view further hints regarding how to shoot and teleport between portals. I'm unsure what could be causing the freezes you experienced (no one else has reported these problems). Does your PC match the minimum spec requirements? Also check that other processes aren't running in the background on your PC. Things like Windows updates can cause lag spikes if they're hammering your disk. In any case there are several graphics options you can reduce in the settings menu to try and raise performance if your PC is towards the low end. Please try those out. Thanks!"
2022-05-28 19:38:22.186838,VibrationsOfDoom,"Obviously, my archery skills bite...","What a great little game!

UPDATE: My archery skills have vastly improved... You definitely have to learn how to aim up and down to make the arrow drop at a certain point, there are different skill sets for firing high up top of a castle wall and being only a short distance above the ground... 

It's my GO TO game... I finally beat the ending sequence ONCE, and haven't been able to do it again since! Be prepared: You don't win that endless onslaught of armies jumping up and down without buying LOTS of knights and a few cannons! I play this EVERY time I fire up the Oculus! FIVE stars instead of 4, what the heck was I thinking!>??!?!?


BIG shout out to the developer for the vibrational tactic in the hand controller. Man, it felt like the arrow really was sliding across the bowstring; how come no one mentioned THAT!? A main reason why VR with Touch is SO much more preferred! And don't forget to reach up with your hand to pull out an arrow before u notch it! Sometimes it felt like I grabbed an arrow and nothing was there, but rarely. 

There's so many scenarios that you won't get bored, I loved seeing the flying dragons! (Though I suspect they must be incredibly difficult to kill). Barely got my mechanics down on the first level, but will keep trying to get better! Can't shoot targets that are too far away yet... How do they do it?","Mar 29, 2019 at 10:35 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:38:22.201798,drewk2525,Great game!,"I just wanted to give a shout-out to the dev of this game.  I was very hesitant about picking up this game, but it was everything I wanted it to be for a VR archery defense game.  I've played through all the levels on hard so far and still struggle with several of them.  There is still an additional difficulty level, which I haven't tried yet.  Has great replayability, which is something many VR games are lacking currently.

Overall, this is a great title, and one of my all time favorite VR games so far.  Highly recommend this, and the price is a steal IMO.","Nov 1, 2018 at 10:54 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:38:22.217756,clerythecleric,Fun game,"Played the first level and half of the next. My arm hurts so much! First time playing an archery game. Got this on sale for like £1. Defo worth the money. Fun game. Not done REAL archery but feels pretty nice to shoot. Only critism would be better sound effects.

Isit a 5* game? No.. Hence why i gave it 4. 
Isit a 4* game? For £1? Sure... If i had paid full price, i'd of probz went down to 3. As fun as it is, its nothing special. Its still just a wave shooter with fairly basic models.","Sep 3, 2018 at 1:20 AM",4, 2,"You can play the levels in any order so try some of the later ones (4 and up) to give the TD side of the game a proper look!

Many thanks for the review!"
2022-05-28 19:38:25.302600,HiThere_,Great archery game,"Title says it all : The cheap price, cubic graphics and maybe even (basic) tower defense mechanics may put you off from trying... but the bottom line is that they don't get in the way of making this is a very enjoyable archery game, and I've played plenty of them. 5 Stars for being an all fun and zero frustration game.","Apr 16, 2018 at 5:30 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:38:25.319554,winston.gates,Really Good Archery Defender,"I purchased this on sale but it is easily worth the full price. You get a lot of content here for less than 10 dollars than some of the more expensive titles. If you like archery games or tower defence games, this is one to pick up.

The game works fine with a desk setup, you don't need a 360 setup to play. You just have to manually rotate your view so that the sensors don't lose track of your hands, rather than physically turning. 

All of the assets are basic and nothing to write home about, however they are all present. It doesn't feel like any sounds or crucial graphical details are missing, it certainly is a complete game and not an early access title.

Difficulty is great. There are plenty of choices to change the challenge of a given senario. I was pretty underwhelmed by the first map and easily was able to beat it on the hardest difficulty but now I am further along and they get really tough. The difficulty choices feel appropriate and good.

All-in-all a fantastic title for the price.","Apr 20, 2018 at 5:17 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:38:25.335512,Zekiah,Worth it! As an archery game,"I enjoy the unique levels and diverse scenery. I feel like the bow mechanics could use a little bit of tweeking to be more smooth but overall it's pretty comparable to all the other archery games I've played. There doesn't seem to be a lot of tower defense aspect to the game and I somewhat wish there was more but it's still enjoyable in its current state as more of a archery focused game and a little TD on the side.(I've only completed about half the levels so far so there could be TD more later on) For the price the game is definitly worth it.-------
Update(11/12) I've now made it through all of the levels and the later levels do involve some more strategy as more units are added. It's pretty long for a VR game with a decent amount of replayability with the leaderboard and different diffuculties. It's also a decent workout and will make you shoulders sore.","Nov 13, 2017 at 12:37 PM",5, 5,"Hi, thanks for the review! The levels introduce new gameplay elements and/or units as you progress through them so it's only the very last levels that have all units available. You'll need them too as it's impossible to complete the later levels without buying AI units to help out! :)"
