2022-05-28 20:15:06.725200,Dropla,Luke! Thank you!,"What a great experience! This is how it should be done! I So hope there will be more! I wonder if we couldn't get like those Peach blossom trees, or Cherry blossom trees? Sitting in those, petals falling, what I wouldn't do. I would pay for that. I don't know what you did to make this so much better than the rest, but, you nailed it! I feel like im there! I like the commentary too! Whoa, wait, there was one place, on a bridge, like i think it was the upper part, what was that walking wriggling dark thing to the right? I was hoping to find out, was it a person that you had to blur? Was it bigfoot? An alien? lol It was cool either way, I have ideas for you, im going to try to email you some ideas maybe. :) genius!",Apr 17 at 1:47 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:15:06.741157,DankyMcJingle,New to VR? This experience is for you.,When I first got my Quest 2 I was browsing the store for things that seemed interesting. I came across this and was pleasently surprised with how amazing the experience was. You really feel like you are at each location and it's incredibly relaxing. If you are new to VR I highly suggest getting this. You won't regret it.,Mar 10 at 12:30 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:15:06.757114,RuneSR2,Best photogrammetry in VR?,"I'm very thankful for the unique experiences - Claustral Canyon was great, Flume Gorge too - and especially Pompeii. But this one is my new reference, even if the content is limited. 
Looks great in solid 90 fps using Rift CV1 ss 2.0, but really blew my mind Revived using Index res 200%. Still got solid 90 fps with the Index - using a GTX 1080. 
You cannot travel as far as in let's say Pompeii or Claustral Canyon, but this app is free - and I've never seen better quality (using Index) - everything simply looks real, and I bet Quest 2 and Rift-S users may have a similar experience. Even Blue Planet VR didn't impress me more.
I'm thankful to Luke Farrer for bringing such awesome moments to VR. Especially in these Covid-19 times, where seeing the real thing isn't easy (or impossible). 
Also such apps may be of great importance for persons having difficulties walking - or for those needing calm places to find peace of mind. 

10/10 - especially considering the price ;-) This would easily be worth 10 bucks to me. And no, Farrer didn't pay me to write this review and sell more free stuff ;-)","Mar 27, 2021 at 1:53 AM",5, 31,Thank you very much for your encouraging comments. Talk about making one feel inspired to keep going! Luke
2022-05-28 20:15:06.771077,matabhaine,Love it,Wish there were more experiences for VR like this. Hope they add more to this. The animations take the already wonderful 3D locations to another level.,Oct 8 at 4:30 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:15:06.786037,TheDissonantEcho,Best Photogrammetry I've Seen!,"This is incredible. Top quality I've seen! I took someone elses reccomendation and put my Quest two to render at 2.0 and it looks simply amazing! BTW i only have a GTX1060 so you don't need a mega computer to do this. I'd love to see longer loops for the videos taken and maybe a few more angles so i can walk around my room and not get to the backside of a rock that wasnt photograpphed! anyways...nobody is doing VR photogrammetry as good as this guy, this is the closest to being there without actually being there!","May 28, 2021 at 3:59 AM",5, 1,We hugely appreciate your positive review.
2022-05-28 20:15:09.900816,Frodosw,Well done!,Very much looking forward to your new locations as you progress your experiences. It's nicely done so far and provides a much needed escape during Covid for those that are at high risk whether they have the vaccine or not. I applaud your efforts for creating this free experience. I think I enjoy the free roam aspect the most. I wish all locations had it. I would suggest the ability to control the volume from within the app as I've seen others mention in their reviews.,Aug 23 at 2:22 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:15:09.915776,Sushifirefox,Been waiting for something like this,"Among the 360 videos and nature photogrammetry type of apps that I've tried so far (and I've tried many, including paid ones), this one is the best, and the only one that I actually enjoyed. Thank you developer for your hard work, attention to detail and such a good quality environments.

In terms of feedback, I'd suggest to have an environment selection as a typical menu with thumbnails of each environment lined up, rather than user having to look around for the links that are scattered across the rocks. Also, the HUD (with sound/music volume, etc.) could be attached to the left arm rather than float in the air, but this isn't that important. Another thing that could be improved is the sound quality. For some of the scenes, sound of the rushing water is a bit too loud, doesn't sound particularly pleasing, and blocks off other ambient sounds. Perhaps it could be recorded separately a bit further away from water, and the quality itself could be enhanced. Volume slider in the UI may be helpful as well. These are just some ideas of how some of the basic features could be improved. 

But overall it was a great experience. Looking forward to seeing more environments! Thank you and keep up the great work!","Mar 28, 2021 at 1:01 PM",5, 7,"Thanks for all your suggestions, they are incredibly helpful. We are making improvements to the user interface, as well as the sound. Really appreciate the positive review! Luke"
2022-05-28 20:15:09.931733,chuck.ungar,Sharpest quality nature app I've seen,"Since I'm cooped up in my house until my vaccine kicks in, the last couple days I pop on the headset at lunch and just sit for half an hour in these beautiful lush landscapes. Totally realistic and relaxing environments. Well done .","Mar 27, 2021 at 4:55 AM",5, 9,Thank you for your positive review! Luke
2022-05-28 20:15:09.947690,Slick1984,The chosen places could have been better,"The videos were clear and sharp. However, some of the places shown were lackluster, IMHO. I will continue to look for updates and hope that the places that are video'd get better. Please keep trying. I want you to succeed.


UPDATE: +2 stars

It looks like Luke is all in on this and I applaud his willingness to travel the U.S. looking for beautiful nature that many of us never get to visit. The views are always clear and he adds some information. Can't wait until you can travel further. 

The U.S. has many caves to explore. Kentucky comes to mind and of course the Southwest.","Apr 29, 2021 at 8:03 AM",5, 0,Thank you for your honest and encouraging review. COVID has forced us to stay local and our choice is limited. Please email me at luke@lost-eagle.com and let me know what ideal places you have in mind for this technology (especially places within the US). It would help us a lot. Thank you.
2022-05-28 20:15:09.962650,krisvdvijver,Quality VR exploration!,"Luke’s done a great job with this! In fact, it’s one of the most immersive experiences in this style that I’ve seen. I don’t even know if I’m looking at photogrammetry or volumetric video, but I love it and I hope many more locations will be added. I wish I could have done this years ago while traveling and integrating portraits into the environment of some of the people I met while being on the road.","Apr 1, 2021 at 11:46 PM",5, 1,Your work sounds really interesting and I've love to know more. We'll be adding more environments and speeding up the creation process in the months ahead. Thanks for your positive review! - Luke
2022-05-28 20:15:13.074981,TimelordQ,"Thank you, Luke","Photogrammetry at it's best. Very, very inspiring work here and something to show off what VR can do to my elderly folks who lack the mobility to see amazing places like this. 

Thank you, Luke, you rock and I'd gladly pay for your next efforts should you decide to expand your offerings and take us to new places.","Mar 31, 2021 at 2:31 PM",5, 1,"We'd love to see this technology being used in old folks' homes. In some ways senior citizens are an ideal end user, especially those who loved the great outdoors when they were younger but who can't move around now. Stay in touch, please, and thanks for the positive review! Luke"
2022-05-28 20:15:13.089942,XtremeHardcoreGamer,I love it!,Obvious passion photogrammetry project from someone who knows what he is doing. There are crashes for me clicking on the nav bar but who knows what is causing that.,Aug 3 at 5:03 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:15:13.104901,smi1ey,"Great experience, but needs work","If you're contemplating if this is worth downloading the answer is yes, but don't expect to spend more than 15min in this. This app does a great job of placing you within a scene although you will notice see through trees and rocks that magically end showing the hillside behind it. Although the problems with the geometry are destracting it is the menus that truely let down this application, they are poorly designed and leave you wondering if there was content that you missed. The audio of the environments is great but when you begin the narration it is completely drowned out (the audio levels need work).

Despite the ovbious flaws with this app it presents a exciting glimpse of what will be possible as technology progresses. I hope the developers continue to refine their product adding additional environments, and polishing the menus, because once they do this will be a VR must have.","Mar 28, 2021 at 6:10 PM",3, 1,Thanks for the constructive feedback which will help us improve our experiences. We will be making significant improvements to the user interface in the near future. Luke

2022-05-28 20:15:16.270591,masterchop,Great nature app!,"This is the best nature app i have tried for the following reason:

-photogrametry resolution is pretty good.
-expiriences are good, not the best but good enough.
-tricks like motion and water is outstanding. <-- this is the best feature.

What is the problem with all nature apps.  I am limited to what ever is put on them.
And this app as been the best needs to change the dinamic of this apps i count on you Luke.

Look your tech is great but you are limited to your team and budget and i guess that you are doing this to make money out of it at some point. So here is the solution.

Make your tech available to the mases but! and the big but is that it will only work on your app.
In this way you can come up with a subscription system like you can upload 10 expiriences but if you want more you have to pay. you can make them private or public and in this way you can make money and the app will cover the whole world and it wont lack content.","Apr 28, 2021 at 3:15 AM",4, 0,We really appreciate your insights. I think your idea is a very good one.

Please continue to have more of this type of VR experience for everyone to enjoy. 
There are so much to see and to learn about the environment of the earth. It is an eye opening and educational VR experience.   Keep up the great work and thank you again.","Apr 25, 2021 at 9:37 AM",5, 0,Thank you very much for your positive review!!
2022-05-28 20:15:16.302506,barrychristie,Almost Perfect,What really amazes me about this is that I usually have a good idea exactly how things were done but in this there are the odd thing that I actually dont know how they did it. This is something I would love to show somebody if I am trying to convince them how real things can be. The only flaw I have spotted is the bird stuck in the sky and this is a rare point in which I think other apps have done it better but considering this one was actually free it is actually amazing how many times it betters its paid conterparts. Really amazing stuff.,"Apr 7, 2021 at 5:23 AM",5, 0,"We really appreciate your review - thanks. Yes, the bird looked pretty bad. Luke"
2022-05-28 20:15:16.317466,GLITCHEDMATRIX,This is very relaxing,It has great potential to be what I always hoped VR could be. The ability to travel to different remote parts of the world and get away from it all in an instant. I really hope for more places to explore in this way. It almost feels as if i'm right there. My constructive feedback is to work on looping the sounds and animations seemlessly and avoid capturing people or animals in the shots if they aren't moving. PLEASE keep this project going. I will use this regularly to check on the progress.,"Apr 5, 2021 at 4:47 PM",5, 0,Really appreciate the feedback. It helps us keep getting better and better.

2022-05-28 20:15:19.435729,cestomano,Just Gorgeous,"Photogrammetric VR experiences are wonderful and getting better and better. And this is a good example of them. I wouldn't mind filling my hard drive with gigs and gigs of photogrammetric data to enjoy these natural environments at home.
Please! More, moreeee :-)
(tested with Quest 2 and Link)
PS: Of course, all experiencies have things to improve. Size in Canyons doesn't seem to be correct. Looking at the trail and the backpack it seems like I'm a gnome ;-)","Mar 27, 2021 at 4:43 PM",5, 0,Thanks for your positive review and the feedback! (loved your comment about the gnome!) Luke
2022-05-28 20:15:19.451686,cav800,Lots of bugs that need to be worked out.,"The few environments that are here are indeed photo realistic and well done. However, as it stands right now you can only teleport to very few spots and these spots are very close together, which makes very little sense. In the beach scene, the narrator encourages you to explore the beach and then leaves you there staring at like three dots all grouped together where you can teleport with none of them actually on the beach. I also could not get the winter scene to load and the sea inlet scene is completely static with water that doesn't move. You are literally looking at a photo and listening to water sounds. I am interested to see if this software can be further developed, but I believe I will have to uninstall for now.","Mar 26, 2021 at 6:53 AM",2, 0,"Just uploaded a new build with a bug fix for the video, and the winter scene shouldn't have been there, and is for the next release - apologies for the inconvenience and appreciate the candid review. Further releases will allow for much greater exploration."

All graphic drivers are updated.,"May 1, 2021 at 5:02 AM",2, 0,"I'm sorry about this! Are you logged in to Oculus, and running the app from Oculus? If you're not logged in, it can sometimes abort. Also, what anti-virus do you have installed? This can sometimes cause issues. If neither of these solutions work, drop me a line at luke@lost-eagle.com with more details of your system and we'll work through it together. It must be something special with your system, as no one else has reported a crashing."
2022-05-28 20:15:19.483601,Aquavemo,Stunning!,Did not expect to find one of the best photogrammetry i have seen so far -  in a free(!) app. That canyon scenes are indeed very suited for VR. 2 minor things: the music in Waterville is too loud and the audio/video clips seem to end a few seconds too soon.,"Mar 29, 2021 at 1:45 AM",5, 0,"Thanks for the positive review and the feedback!
