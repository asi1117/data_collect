2022-05-28 18:35:52.613170,szy33,Great idea.,"It looks very good to see that girl talking and interacting.

The agent's body is a bit annoying. The subtitles are a little bit too low. Also, I have trouble following the story, as I was trying to watch the girl when she's talking. Looking forward to further visual novels.","Oct 4, 2020 at 5:21 AM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 18:35:52.643089,Chrisc1978,Story was enjoyable.,"I was sceptical if this visual novel would be any good, I watched Spice and Wolf VR also by Spicy Tails that I liked so I gave it a try, but honestly I liked this story more. I am going to keep an eye out for more VR experiences like this. The price is very reasonable for how much work went into it.

If I had to say if their was anything I didn't like about it I would say. The agents body was anoying if you try to change your veiw angle.","Jun 30, 2019 at 10:20 PM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 18:35:52.657052,Chris2033,One for the sci-fi fans,First some difficulty. To navigate the save/load menu I had to hold the down key to stop the cursor returning to the top item. Maybe a hardware issue of mine or a touch control issue and a bug? This will not make it easy for me to get all the endings. Otherwise a well written sci fi short about a human who lives in isolation from an AI dominated society. A touching story but what can you expect from the writer of Spice and Wolf. I have read visual novels and realise to get different endings you can skip chapters and a bit of trial and error is needed. But with this menu bug I can not even think about it. Lucky I got the good ending in one sitting. And yes that means...,"Feb 18, 2019 at 5:44 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:35:52.673009,Adeon55,Beautiful,"Wow, VN's in VR are great!

The subtitles don't hinder immersion, in the sense that it didn't feel like there were words floating in the room with me. My only personal problem is I'm not the fastest reader, and unlike normal VN's that just have picture shifts or brief animations, Lux is constantly moving & reacting to everything she & the protag say (in real time, all fluidly motion captured), so I often paused to read the longer bits of what was being said, because I didn't want to miss a moment of Lux's movements! :) But if you need the pausing like me, that is well executed, too. The only issue with the Eng subtitles was that 2 or 3 lines in the whole thing were missing.

Btw, the credits briefly roll between each of the 5 ""episodes"" (I usually used the ~30 seconds to take the headset half off and rest my eyes), so don't think it's over already when that happens, like I did. :P","Jun 30, 2018 at 11:49 AM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 18:35:55.826575,curtisee111,Great! - ... With some personal flaws,"Don't get me wrong, this is a beautifully well-made game, and I'm not saying it's ""bad"" whatsoever. It's got a bit of comedy in it, cute moments, a good story and all, but a few things could be better. For example, Having to reconfigure where the rifts sight was every time the protagnonist stood up and sat down was annoying, forgetting to save once and bam, 20 minute wait to get back to where ya were (no reminders to save D: ) and also,                                                                                              ***""Slight"" spoiler*** The decision you get to make in the end could of had a little more time to let you choose what ya wanted to do, as the options appeared and just before i knew what was happening, the game had seen me looking at the option I didn't want :(
--END of spoiler--
If you're up for a story with a cute loli, then this is probably for you. Maaaybe a price drop tho? (Idk how expensive vr experiences can be so that could be normal pricing) :)","Jul 27, 2017 at 6:00 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 18:35:55.842532,crazymurdock77,Brilliant VR Visual Novel,"Not the longest game by any means (maybe an hour and a half), but if you think of it like a VR anime, then that's not that short.  
It's beautifully animated, and like nothing else I've played in VR.  
Trouble is it makes you realise what could be possible. Oh how I'd love a full Danganronpa VR (Not that this is anything like that).","Jul 1, 2017 at 4:11 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 18:35:55.856495,Z-ice,Amazing! The future of Anime,"This was really a master piece of a new way to watch Anime, to relly be a part of it, and allso make your own decision to affect the story, i thought that all her animation would be very repetetive in like 1 hour game play but it wasent, and her animations was in briliant quality, so it actualy gave her a bit of personality fealing, shure it hade some smal bugs and visual errors, but for this early days for VR its mindblowing! already looking forward to next Movie/GameMovie :D","Jun 30, 2017 at 3:53 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 18:35:55.872452,RikkaKami,Quite good.,"If you like visual novels then its for you. My only issues with it is fact that text is 2 low on screen, and most annoying part is players body. Would be way much better without it.","Aug 9, 2017 at 9:25 PM",4, 4,
