2022-05-28 15:42:17.103308,NotTheLips,Great for a stargazer!,"As someone who has spent many a clear-skied night gazing up at the stars, and a healthy subset of those hours peering through a telescope, I find this program does exactly what it says.

Sure, it's limited to just our solar system, but let's face it, we're unlikely to see anything off-planet in our lifetimes.  This is a nice taste of what that might be like.

Some might find it boring, because there's nothing to shoot at, but for the patient sky watcher, there's a lot here to enjoy.","Feb 2, 2019 at 1:56 PM",4, 20,
2022-05-28 15:42:17.118268,GamerSan,An amazing experience,"Star Chart literally lets you explore the whole solar system in 3D, stand on the surface of the moon & mars as well as the new Orrery experience which is a great way to view the solar system. I personally love holding planets, moons, asteroids and stars in my hands. This app is educational, beautiful, detailed and utterly engrossing. I love it.","Dec 23, 2018 at 12:38 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 15:42:17.134225,FastLawyer,More than just looking at stars,"So Touch controllers are fully supported. What some people don't realize is that when you're on the moon ... you press grab to get out of it. That's it. And for those claiming it is not accurate ... do you realize that it would almost be impossible to have the known universe to scale (and forget about the unknown universe which light has not reached us yet)? It has a pretty accurate solar system to scale showing the rotations around the sun. You can also see all the major constellations and the name of each star along with some limited info. Anyways, I love this app, especially the free exploration where you can click on any star, planet, moon, asteroid and get more information and even fast travel to that location. Beware though, this is mostly an educational app and meant mostly for science geeks. There is no game here. It's not a movie either. It's just learn to ""Look at the stars, see how they DON'T shine for you.""","May 27, 2018 at 9:17 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 15:42:17.148188,JonnyTenebrous,Doesn't Fully Support Oculus Touch...,"I didn't even make it past the moon (which is part of the tutorial) before getting stuck because it required me to press a button that doesn't exist on the Oculus Touch controllers.  The only option in this case was to quit straight out of the experience.  I thought the concept was cool, so was quite disappointed. This was purchased as part of a bundle so unfortunately can't be returned.  Hoping for a patch some day, but we'll see.","May 26, 2018 at 6:45 PM",1, 5,"Hi there Jonny Tenebrous,
The B button and the Grip button both function as ""back"" in that scenario. Please check and let us know if this is still an issue.
Kind regards, the Star Chart Team."
2022-05-28 15:42:17.164145,LT_Teamkill,This app is a scam.,"This app does contain some 3d planets, but the starfield in the background is 2d.  It is not VR by any stretch of the imagination.  I purchased this thinking that the stars would be in the correct locations and that they would be 3d, seems like a reasonable expectation from an Oculus Rift ASTRONOMY program... But yeah, no.  Not only is the starfield not 3d or VR, it is also not accurate. It is just a background image of stock photos or randomly generated noise, its hard to tell.","Mar 7, 2017 at 9:08 AM",1, 44,"Hi there LT_Teamkill,
Star Chart contains over 100 3D solar bodies (planets, asteroids, moons, etc.) all of which you can travel to in 3D and / or hold on your hand (requires a touch controller). All the stars are in the correct position, and are based on data from NASA, no random noise or similar - these are accurate to the night sky. Also these stars are all possible to ""hold in your hands"" in 3D on your touch controller. Apart from the Milky Way, the entire app is 3D and pretty much every object is able to be selected or held and or visited in 3D. There is no ""scam"" here, we have worked on Star Chart for over a decade across multiple devices and this version was built specifically for VR. We hope you revisit the app and explore some of its depth - the app is in fact extraordinarily deep, 3D and VR ;).
All the best, the Star Chart Team."
2022-05-28 15:42:20.275822,Brian1256,Travel the Solar System,"Love this program, closest to traveling the solar system you'll ever get! Learn the stars too! Orbiting the planets and the moons of planets is my favorite part. Awesome!","May 23, 2017 at 7:28 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 15:42:20.291779,hjlerwill,Must have pad controller,"I've never been able to get the xbox controller to work woth my PC, so I was pleased when I saw this supported the touch.

However, you are required to push a button that existsinly on the xbox controller.  If that does not work, this game is a waste of money.  

The one star rating reflects the fact that it is sold as a touch-enabled application when you cannot even start it with the touch.","Dec 24, 2016 at 4:43 AM",1, 10,"Hi hjlerwill,
Star Chart is best used with Oculus Touch controllers, but works perfectly well with both gamepad and the remote. Please revisit the app and try again.
Kind regards, the Star Chart Team."
2022-05-28 15:42:20.305742,Jacob1z,Wish you had more freedom,Im hoping the devs will make this game somewhat like Space Engine. But its very cool to go fly around the Solar System.,"Feb 25, 2017 at 11:26 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:42:20.320702,sbalko,Needs work,"Creating a VR experience that lets you zoom through the solar system is something of a no-brainer. If only the creators of this app had done a better job implementing it. Yes, it is easy to find all the planets, engage warp 9 and travel there. But the planet imagery is not any spectacular or recent. Case in point: Pluto's surface texture was not updated with the photos taken by NASA's New Horizon space probe. Also, traveling in among the planets, planetoids and moons is dull. Why couldn't the app creators built in an automated travel mode? Worse, circling around a planet is literally a neck braking experience, given that you have to twist and turn your head 360 degrees to go full circle.","Nov 15, 2016 at 7:07 PM",2, 10,"Hi sbalko,
We're sorry to hear that you are not enjoying Star Chart. However, just to address some of your points - Pluto's surface is absolutely based on the New Horizon space probe data. We have painstakingly merged the highest level detail imagery from NASA to create a stunningly accurate visual of Pluto - one you are unlikely to find anywhere else. In our latest update we've added an Orrery Tour which is probably something you'd enjoy - it targets your request for an ""automated travel mode"" - please give it a go and let us know your thoughts. And finally, I believe the control scheme has been updated since your last use - please give it a go :).
Kind regards, the Star Chart Team."
2022-05-28 15:42:20.335662,jimbydude,Superb Educational Value,"The amount of information tha the app has and the really nice way it presents it is very cool. However I would say mostly due to using Touch controls.

It is worth investing your cash I would say.","Dec 29, 2016 at 4:00 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:42:23.442353,EvilSpudBoy,,"This app is much better with support for the Oculus Touch.   The way the touch controls have been implemented is really cool.
The one feature I feel it is missing is the ability to select the time as well as move forward and backward in time at different rates.  I hope they add this in the future.","Dec 21, 2016 at 11:31 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:42:23.457313,wrenth,Dissapointing,"Guys, you have to do more to make it interesting. The ammount of information you share with your app is very low. The interface  clarity and the way we move around objects is very unsatisfying also. You did not added any additional content... is it really all you can offer in this exagerated price? HTC apps kill yours where you are standing. I hope that touch will change at least movent patterns but you need to make it reach of content if you want the stars!","Dec 13, 2016 at 8:33 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 15:42:23.472273,Patroclus76,enjoyable education,I am obviously more easily impressed than some of my peers here. I found this educational and inspiring. It is rather like having your own astrometrics lab without Seven,"Jan 2, 2017 at 9:35 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 15:42:23.487233,Hicks613,Don't bother,"There is barely enough content here for a mobile app.  Follow the ""Space Engine"" project instead.  It is free and absolutely stunning compared to this tripe.","Dec 6, 2016 at 3:24 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 15:42:23.505185,Wildfyre,Very disapointing,"$0.99 apps on your iphone offer more information.  The controls get stuck and you can't move around properly.  Rarely do I review things like this, but it was so horrible, I felt I needed to.  It feels like a Beta at best.","Nov 20, 2016 at 8:00 AM",1, 5,

There definitely is a way to turn around, but it does depend on the mode. Generally moving your thumbstick will rotate you or the object in front of you. Kind regards, The Star Chart Team."
