They feature the Sky Lantern Festival, the Land Lantern Fesitval, and the Night Market, the last of which is the only video to feature food. They are interesting peeks into a different culture - if that's what you're looking for, then check it out!","Nov 1, 2017 at 5:32 AM",3, 1,

This takes us to three places in China and Hong Kong -- Two lantern festivals and a food market. Although the 360 degree videos lacked the sharpness of the preview images, the narration really added to the experience. Some people might complain that the sky lantern festival is not environmentally correct, but I liked it!","Aug 21, 2017 at 5:28 AM",3, 1,
