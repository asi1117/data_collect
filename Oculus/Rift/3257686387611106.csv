2022-05-28 20:26:24.206799,True.Clam,Really good also tip for errors start up,"1. my experice so far
Its really fun, being able to create anything i want and to also play around like they are a kid's toy has really help me with stress
im going to see if i could take my creation and put the into other softwears so i could use the in games like VR chat but if i cant thats fine, i just like making things
my only problem is the controls are a little confusing even after the tutorial but im slowly getting use to them
2. Tip/help for people who are having start up errors
I use a Rift S, I havent had any problems when starting the game, I look into it and the program supports Rift and Rift S so if your using something different that my be the problem

Strange, but this is not a problem in the Oculus Medium.
It would be nice to add functionality:
- Pinch tool
- Real Clay Tool (that not just draw in space, but sculpts the surface, as in the Z-brush)
- Ability to export individual layers
- Retopology. Ability to set the direction of the grid. Probably something like Zsphere

First of all, brushes feel SO CLUNKY. Especially move tool.I can't get even a fraction of precision I can get in zbrush with my cheap huion tablet.
 Also lighting, it awful. It's dim and flat, and I don't know what kind of black magic it is, but I can better see form in zbrush on my flat screen than inside a VR headset. I got it, developers didn't want to implement matcaps for some reason. But give the surface at least basic shading! It's flat, 100% non-reflective with slight hints of shadows. 
 This program is still free and it's basic functional works, even though I don't like it. You probably can get used to it. And interface isn't complicated at all. So, two stars.","Mar 18, 2021 at 1:48 AM",2, 11,

2022-05-28 20:26:40.124992,Spikeenick,Zbrush + Photoshop,"Fantastic app. 

Imagine using Zbrush in VR but being able to grab your sculpt with on hand and use your other to detail, paint and more. 

Have been using this for a few days and the fact that this is free blows my mind. 
Everything about this app is amazing and when using on oculous you have the added bonus of being able to present your sculpts in your link home. 

Stunning. 

However the missing stars are because i would love to have a couple more tools and fetures. 

Please please please add the following ( devs ) to every one else reading this these are currently not avalable tools. 

- Material views - customisation. 
currently there is one set type of material, you cant ajust the specularity, opacity, ect. this would be a small addition but would make the biggest diffrance. 

- Hardsurface modeling - Vert manipulation. 
Having the ability to play with things on an even lower level before stepping up to higher levels or event haveing a anchor manipulation would be amazing. aditionally more primitaves to use as stamps ect would be super useful. 
( however you can create your own burshes to do this but that is alot of preperation work ) 

- Masking 
Such a basic feture that can not be understated when it comes to painting or event hardening an edge, having the ability to mask a section to then work on another area that may be contigious is such a powerful adition to a toolkit that not having it feels debilitating. but again with this being a free app i cant grumble too much. 

- Flatten Brush to folow surfaces or the brush. 
The flatten brus works at the angle being initialy aimed at if this could work with the surface this would alow hard surface modeling withch again would be a HUGE step and open up alot more to the community. 

Honestly if these things were added i dont think i would use any other program as this would just be better in every way. 

Regardless love the app and would recomend.","Nov 17, 2020 at 9:20 AM",4, 61,
2022-05-28 20:26:40.139951,RageEmittingDiode,Simple but powerful creative space,"It's not brimming with features, there are significant limitations. Generally speaking, you won't be producing high quality models in this without fighting an uphill battle.

But once you've figured out the nuances of handling its tools, it's a lot of fun and you can really pump out ideas FAST. It's GREAT for first draft models, or just fun personal/hobby work.

I hope Adobe haven't bought this package so that they can just forget about it - because I'd really love to see these kind of tools mature in the future.","Dec 26, 2020 at 10:43 AM",4, 8,

With the same gamer PC ... I still don't feel at all the 90 hertz or a satisfying FPS. It feels like 30 fps 50 hz max with link compared to a real good 90 with CV1 . We want precision on Medium and for the eye , I'm quickly tired of the ... slow FPS impression while working.

You have to plan your sculpting and having the ability to pull in several reference images and float them around you, is just next level. I really recommend this application. Currently using the Quest with Oculus Link has a weird stuttering bug, so I run the application using the REVIVE launcher instead. Revive is a desktop application that uses Steam VR.

It's better than ever, and the new feature where you get to import other sculpts into each other is something I did not realize I was waiting for for such a long time.

2022-05-28 20:27:11.785990,Boudichon,Fantastic tool!,"This tool is amazing. Very simple to use and can make great things very quickly. I wasn't expecting it to be that much fun to be honest, but it's awesome.

The only issue I had was that the game refused to boot at first. I didn't even get an error message. I could keep pressing start and nothing would happen. I had to spend over an hour and try a bunch of diagnostics and looking through the logs to find the problem.

Here's my fix for those that have the same issue. I ran the program (Medium.exe) from the command prompt (cmd), only then i received the error message that prevented the program from starting. For me, I was missing the file ""Vulkan-1.dll"". You can find and download this library online. Once I installed it, it worked perfectly. And even with this issue, I still give 5 stars because it's a really amazing product.","Aug 30, 2020 at 12:20 PM",5, 2,
