2022-05-28 15:52:42.547511,Nsidor04,"Seemed good, but broke my headset","After installing this game, my headset would constantly crash in any vr game after about 5-10 minutes. Im not sure if this is particular to my headset or if it will affect yours too. However, from the glimpses of the game that I got, it seemed cool enough, and if it works for you, it could end up being a fun game. (I know it was this game because after installing, the crashes would occur, and after uninstalling it, they stopped.)",Aug 30 at 1:19 AM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 15:52:42.562471,RandyMagnum007,It's ok,"Graphics are nice and the mechanics seem to be pretty solid. I can't get past the fact that this is suppose to be set in midevil times, with no electricity, yet somehow they have battery powered walky'talkies. That one little thing ruined it for me. Is that overly critical? Perhaps, but, for me, it completely destroyed the immersion factor.","Feb 10, 2020 at 12:39 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 15:52:42.577431,JeremyC85,That voice acting tho...,"This has been a game that I honeslty can't stop thinking about since starting and can't wait to get back to every time I stop... mechanics, graphics, setting are all SUPERB! 

Its set in a medevil castle is some alternate universe (because the guards all use walkie-talkies lol). You collect loot and sneek around. Some combat is available without spoiling much.

The game is not perfect, although I'm having a BLAST playing it. The voice acting is HORRIBLE. Its comical to the point where I believe the developer did this on purpose! Also, the loot has no purpose outside of 'high score'. Would gladly pay $60 for a second game with a fleshed out RPG element or store to spend the loot. 

All in all, GREAT game. The devs have released multiple patches fixing almost everything that other reviews have complained about when it was first released too! BUY THIS GAME","Sep 24, 2019 at 5:16 PM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 15:52:42.592391,drakeiddon,needs alot of work and devs threaten you,"to devs: putting a legal threat to players during loading screens just makes you out as idiots.

The start of the game is reasonably fun but there are tonnes of problems, i personally quite like the hood as it gives a sense of claustrophobia when sneaking, but here are a few main problems with the game, from biggest to smallest issue

-if your head goes near a wall you will be completely blinded by a bright white screen telling you to move your head, going from a dark room to a white screen is not fun, please make it a dark screen with white text, instead of a white screen with dark text
- Guards are sometimes invincible to being knocked out, automatically making you game over
- The pace in which you silently walk is slower than the pace that the guards walk, making it impossible to sneak up on them without distracting them, which would be that bad, but alot of the time guards will not investigate distractions
- sometimes if a guard almost spots you (red outline) they will become stuck in that location making it near impossible to continue without just resetting the level.
-levels can sometimes be insanely short and at the end of it all the score screen is meaningless, you cant do anything with the stuff you steal and there is no real reason to search for the hidden valuable loot

the game definately has potential and i look forward to it being improved, but the combination of immersion breaking problems and constantly getting reminders that the devs will sue you if you so much as talk about the later levels to other people has made me decide to drop the game for the time being.","Jul 6, 2019 at 4:19 AM",2, 184,
2022-05-28 15:52:42.607351,mishka11,Great Game! But could be even better!,"Im writing this review to counter some of the (IMHO) unfair negative reviews.  Because of those reviews....i almost didnt get this game and once i did, i almost quit. But I'm glad I stuck it out! By the 3rd level...I was hooked. 

The artwork and castle design is stunning.  In fact, once you get further into the castle,  you'll understand why they put up the legal disclaimer.  No doubt they want to protect their hard work and intellectual property of the art and design.   I found myself wanting to roam the halls and take in the scenery. Just gorgeous!

That said, this game has YUGE potential to become even more awesome. For all the work and effort the developers put into it...hopefully they'll consider making some small changes that would make huge differences and would address some review complaints. For example: 

- Finding/Stealing the Loot. There should be a reward for collecting loot. Giving the option to upgrade or purchase tools would take this game to a whole other level. Such as purchasing clubs/sticks, fire sticks, faster shoes, quieter shoes, concealing cloak, etc.
- You cant grab loot and run. Youre forced to stay and place loot.
- We need a percentage or total items at the end of each level so we know how much we achieved vs missed.  
- ""Thieves View"" should have option of toggling on/off seeing guards and seeing loot. Currenlty, it only shows exit and occasional guards
 - The clubs and candlesticks...should be more avail and should regenerate if you lose them. Also, they shouldnt disappear when you put them down either.
- More climbing would be fun.
- Hints/Tips should be available on main menu..not just load screen
- Decrease load times.  Yikes it takes a long time to reload after dying
- Storyline needs streamlining... when devs try to be clever and complex it can end up a confusing mess until the end of the game

Final note: Gamers are getting tired of Devs who keep pushing SJW grandstanding and virtue signalling in thier games. Just sayin","Aug 15, 2019 at 8:37 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 15:52:45.720027,OculusAbsolute,Shhhhhhhhh - this is not a full review,"At the end of stage six, we get a message strictly forbidding any disclosure about the game at all without devs permission. Since we cant discuss jack squat from stage seven onwards this review is only based on the first six stages... 

A game with only six very short levels and a hit n miss stealth system that is either too easy, or rather pathetic at times is nothing special i wish i could say more about the game... oh yes it has nice graphics folks

anyway that about covers the first six levels of the game and all we are allowed to talk about, so.... yea glad i got it on pre-order and saved a tenner !!","Jul 7, 2019 at 12:16 AM",3, 52,
2022-05-28 15:52:45.735984,Megalithik,Decent,"A patch dropped for this on 2/6/19, They added a option to remove the Hood which took up 1/3rd of your view so you can see full screen now which is great, fast response from devs.  

The game itself is excellent visually on the high settings (gtx 1080 or better), not having any blurry issues here.  It's fairly realistic looking, though the audio footsteps are very loud to make sure you hear them (there is a option to adjust their volume).

Gameplay wise you get a bit of the story then you're left in a room to sneak around in.  Some guards walk around, some stand there, some need to be distracted.  There's a special vision mode that shows you where you need to go and primary pathway objectives.  But you can also sneak around and find treasure which doesn't seem to really do anything for you besides add a bit of extra gameplay and challenge.

Im six chapters in and I'm enjoying my time with it.  I did pre-order it though, i would not drop 40 bucks on this game , i'd give it a value of 25-30 bucks.  Wait for it to go on sale.  Seems like 40 bucks is just the new price for everything new now which is getting a bit excessive for some of these games IMO

EDIT: Chapter 7 has a legal warning that comes up saying no filming or pictures can be shared without permission or risk fines.  Kind of an odd thing to put in the middle of a video game.

Chapter 8 sucked, died here a lot due to getting stuck on corners and in thresholds of doorways.  This chapter needs a QA passthru to fix problems.

Update2:  Finished the game, 12 chapters in all.  Final thoughts are that I enjoyed the game and the story .  This is one of the few VR games i've played thru to the very end.

Some nitpicky issues
-When talking over the radio it seems like the dialogue gets cut off
-Controls can sometimes get whacky i noticed this more late game than early game
-Distractions sometimes don't work the first time you try
-During dialogue you can get stuck in place facing away from the people talking","Jul 9, 2019 at 11:42 PM",4, 21,
2022-05-28 15:52:45.749946,Jasagna,It's a nice start but...,"Note: I haven't finished the game. I am maybe 90 mins in but going to pause it until more patches happen.

Pros: 
Gorgeous game (I personally like the hood even though they patched it to be optional)
Love the overall concept. I love the Thief and Dishonored series.
Main voice actors are solid.

Cons:
Getting loot is pointless as there is no upgrade system or anything tied to getting the loot which defeats the purpose of being a thief.
Voice acting from generic male NPCs is generally subpar/anime cringe. 
The thing I really dislike is if a guard spots you, that's in GAME OVER. The game dumps you back to the desk with the options.  It doesn't respawn you back in the level. What?!?!? Baffling. DEVS, PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP.","Jul 7, 2019 at 10:12 PM",3, 28,
2022-05-28 15:52:45.765903,RuneSR2,A great experience!,"The hood is actually quite awesome, takes away the feeling of wearing scuba gear and makes you feel like a real thief. I don't think this game is different from the trailer, at least I wasn't disappointed. Graphics are about as demanding as Seeking Dawn, ok not quite but you get the idea. Using Medium or High settings you activate tesselation, so 2D stones on ground and/or in walls get real 3D surfaces. This is very GPU demanding but looks great. Using a GTX 1080 I forced super sampling 2.0 and used High settings - and the game looked truly awesome - like being present in a real castle. Fps felt like 90 even if it's always 45 thanks to ASW 2.0. I don't think I could play this game without ASW 2.0, even using low settings I get only 45 fps - but that's using super sampling 2.0, which greatly enhances depth perception and image sharpness. If SteamVR doesn't directly support the Oculus drivers, then the Oculus version may perform heads and shoulders better than the SteamVR version. I really don't have performance problems - and the castle looks awesome including the surroundings. Low graphics settings look great too, texture details seem the same as using High, shadows looked nice too - but since I got 45 fps using both Low and High settings I went for High ;-) I'd recommed that the devs make a ""Customs"" setting for graphics, letting users set up everything according to individual preferences. 
Gameplay is extremely linear and some levels are very short, so take your time to investigate everything - don't rush through the levels. Using CV1 the sound and music are awesome. Maybe this is somewhat a copy of Thief, but it's still a first for VR.  
Worst part for me was the controls - controls felt dated. Shadow Legend can show the devs how to implement perfect controls. Do support smooth turning and let us have HMD-directed locomotion. The devs have put in a lot of hours making this game - do give the game a bit more polish and it'll truly shine.","Jul 6, 2019 at 6:19 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:52:45.780863,MicroKong,"Not bad, but needs more work","The gameplay is nice, easy to learn, easy to play. In every level (that we're allowed to speak of) there are 3 ""special"" items, that act as bonus if you collect them per stage. They're the same items in every level, and up to stage 6 it's unclear if the repetition is meant to hint at their significance to the plot, or that the devs didn't bother adding a much needed veriety to such items. Plot wise it's kinda bland, you're a theif going into a castle full of guard (hoping to score serious loot?), but end up involved in with a knight commander (??) and help her... do something, not quite clear what's our motive as a theif in this is... The mechanics that are introduced are simple, but it feels that sometimes they are ""too simple"", as our character doesn't carry any tools with him (unless you count the ""Gloves of objective-seeing"" an item...)

Overall a fun adventure (up to stage six), and if you want to know what happened next, you'll have to buy the game, since last time I passed from stage 6 to 7 there was a big red warning from the devs not to talk about anything beyond stage 6. Who knows, maybe there is more plot hidden in there... or not... *dramatic sounds*","Jul 18, 2019 at 12:24 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:52:48.875589,Scratty84,,The graphics are fine on my computer (1070 ti Rift CV1 Ryzen 2700 X). The game feels more like a story experience but after the first 30 minutes I am still enjoying it. The hood seems a bit strange in the beginning but after getting used to it it was fine for me. The developers also promised to make it optional in an upcoming update. The game is very linear so it is about experiencing the story. I think the game was worth the preorder price but considering it is rather short I would not have paid the full price for it. Also the scale seems a bit off. Everything feels a bit too big and the ground is too far below (similar to Arctica 1).,"Jul 6, 2019 at 3:52 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:52:48.891543,TheFishGuru,Not enjoyable.,"I only played it for a few minutes before i realised that there problems. first and most noticable. You character has a hood that covers up 50% of your vision and i couldn't find any settings in the game to see if i could turn it off . Secondly, This could be on my end but i restarted several times and it still persisted, but, the oculus home watch was permantly showing ruining all immersion. I understand that this is me being nitpicky but i thought i would at least warn people. 

Hope this helps","Jul 6, 2019 at 1:59 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 15:52:48.907503,Gabriel_Prime,Broken and dishonest.,"I am one of the pitiful fools who pre-ordered this game based on its previews. This was not a forthcoming release. This is a review of as much of the game as I could tolerate:

Graphics:
 The game looks really nice. There is, unfortunately, a hood the player is forced to wear that blocks most everything outside of a roughly 40 degree FOV. My suggestion for immersion would be to allow the player to pull their hood up or down, and treat that element as camouflage, rather than address this as yet another menu item. There is also a scaling issue that makes everything appear very large.

Movement:
You’re allowed to turn on “FREE MOVE.”  But free movement, in this case, includes snap turning.  Snap turning is the antithesis of free movement. I hope the devs eventually do their part in the war against teleportation and snap turning. 

Mechanics and Gameplay: 
To begin, the game has you use your “thief’s view” in order to show you 2 super-obvious nav points along a very linear path. I figured this was simply to illustrate a mechanic that would prove to be useful later on—however, this is not the case, as the thief’s view serves only to indicate every obvious thing one needs to do in order to progress the story.

  The player is forced down a very narrow path. Coins are highlighted along the way. There is zero need to highlight objects when the game forces you within inches of their vicinity. The use of a menu in order to store your items is unnecessary. One should be able to place items within a pouch on their side, or something similar to that, so that they’re not constantly breaking immersion.

 The second nav point—a rope—has you climb a rope only to cut to a dark screen and then teleport you into a room where your character then declares “okay, I’ve made it in.” The devs shouldn’t pull the player out like that. It would be far more satisfying to actually climb into the castle rather than hear about how the climb apparently happened via a bit of all-too-obvious expositio","Jul 8, 2019 at 1:59 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 15:52:48.922461,Raunhofer,Almost as bad as the Focus on You,"This is no Thief VR.

- You'll find gold and other artifacts just lying around in makes-no-sense places.
- The castle layout has no point, it's just random corridors guarded by those fantasy anime rhino-helmet dudes.
- The world scale is massively off. All characters are super big and tall.
- Your character is constantly commeting something unnecessary.
- The goddamn hood eating away your already limited FoV.
- The story is as thin as a paper sheet.

Basically just a dull walking simulator that cannot be saved with updates. I'm sure the rating would be even lower if refunders would be allowed to rate games.","Jul 6, 2019 at 7:17 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 15:52:48.937421,ebookee,Interesting game but sthing is missing,"I was looking forward to the day of release of this game. Unfortunately my feelings about it are mixed.
  On the positive side, it has the best graphics of any ""thieflike"" game ever created. It also employs original mechanics in stashing loot after picking it up, which feels entertaining as you place it in a golden bag suddenly appearing in the air, in front of you. Also no complain on free locomotion the speed of which is decided by the force you apply on the stick.
  On the negative side, the game makes you feel taller than you really are and no height calibration setting is available. An important miss as far as I am concerned, especially when you look towards the virtual floor and you realise it'a little further off than you re accustomed to in real life.
  The second negative point is the simplistic gameplay which doesn't give you many options (you can't even fight or outrun the guards, they detect you and it's game over). Also where are the water, noisemaker arrows, flashbombs :), visibility and sound sensor? Give us options developers, don't end the game when it's getting hotter. And fix the height thing. Thanks. I haven't regretted my purchase but maybe it was a bit premature if these don't get fixed.","Jul 7, 2019 at 4:55 AM",3, 8,

2022-05-28 15:52:52.090986,ParadiseDecay,I don't see why all the hate?,"My Quick Thoughts:
I don't really see all the negativity with this game, sure they could have added more elements like those featured in the original Thief games to make it better, but apart from that this was an enjoyable experience. One of the major downfalls for the game I guess would be the price. (Developers maybe make the game cheaper or state that it's in Early Access and work on fixing the things people request/suggest etc.)
All in all I had a really good experience, it was fresh and different for me and I don't normally enjoy sneaking around in VR games.
The graphics, environments and animations are AAA quality and you can tell a lot of time and effort has gone into them.
One of the biggest complaints I did see was the Hood which is now removable, so I hope those with the negative reviews for this issue alone, change their ratings.
