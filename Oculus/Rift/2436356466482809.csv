2022-05-28 20:48:40.270530,Loffen8880,Simple but good,"This is a simple VR puzzle adventure of sorts that took me a few hours to get through. Graphically it's pretty good, the puzzles are simple (which I like) and the presentation is very nice. Sound-wise it's a bit sparse and the voice acting on the girl isn't the best.

I think it's a bit too short to deserve more than 4 stars, and it's not a game that you will come back to and play through again either.",Nov 1 at 6:07 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:40.289482,JamesDWestoby,Cheap... I can afford a tenner...,"So, this was on offer - a tenner, so I bought it. How bad can it be?
Answer - it is BEAUTIFUL. Reminiscent of 'Lost Pets' and so easy to get into.
In fact it was such a NON waste of money my other half bought it too. 
(Actually I bought it on Quest 2 and ONLY [cross] installed on the PC so I could leave this review.)
So instead of one copy for around £15 or whatever they got MORE out of us.
Mind you it is a shame there isn't a way to pass content onto a[nother] family headset. (Only play once at a time though - I KNOW you can login as someone else).","Jun 28, 2021 at 12:15 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:48:40.317405,SenorSnacks,Brilliant.,"I have been gaming since before Atari 1800 and have always favored the shooters.  I have three daughters and have been drawn into many fantasy movies over the years as they grew up.  

This game pulled me into it in about five minutes.  The view was amazing to me and the interaction with the controllers added to the experiance.  No pressure, no AI trying to hunt you down.  Just play, explore solve and be amazed.  

I bought it at Christmas for my youngest and thought I would give it a run for a few minutes yesterday afternoon.  No football on so I gamed.   6 hours later I juuuuust about finished it  At 1AM I woke up, in a nest on the couch that I made with boundry changes, to maybe finish it up.  I woke looking up the well walls with the lights from previous levels played (If you played this game, you know what I mean).

Get this.  I loved every minute of it.","Jan 25, 2021 at 8:39 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 20:48:40.347325,SacredMom,Down the Rabbit Hole(Alice n Wonderland),"This was so fun!  And the developers were so clever on how they had you follow this game or had the game follow you around lol!   The game tickled the brain and made you think abit.  Even tho I found it easy it was still fun because the puzzles were new, different and fun!  I definately recommend this game for all people and I'm 51 years old! Awesome world building, Like I'm in a pop-up book in a way!  ♥Mom","Dec 5, 2020 at 6:13 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:48:43.456010,Leper_Scum,Amazing stuff,This game is surreal. It's like you're sitting (or standing) in a story book guiding the protagonist down the rabbit hole. I'd like to see more games similar to this.,"Oct 30, 2020 at 9:20 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 20:48:43.484933,Akila95,Deserves more reviews!,"This game is really good! It's charming, got a really good VR concept, the diarama style works really well! It's a shame it's short but the game is worth the price, even more so if you can get it at a discount.","Nov 12, 2020 at 6:54 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:43.499893,amanda.n.leeson,"Diarama style gameplay, done well","I've been looking for other games like Moss and this was probably the closest I've come across so far, but it doesn't quite compare overall. It was worth the money for sure, a lot of the scenery was cool to look at and it was very creative in some of the gameplay, but it was lacking in a few ways as well. I wish the story hadn't been so little kid-ish, and that the puzzles were a little more interesting (they really hold your hand). I get that it's a ""kids"" story but it was originally a classic, and I think it would've been really neat had they gone more in that direction, as it felt a bit like I was in a bad disney rip-off. I did find myself saying outloud a few times ""this is so cool!"", but by the end was a bit disappointed with the experience overall. It's worth it for sure considering the general market (it really is so much better than most of what's out there right now) but I just think there's a lot more potential here.","Jul 21, 2020 at 9:05 AM",4, 31,
2022-05-28 20:48:43.514853,HarbingerThrace,"wish it were longer, but LOVED it","Love the idea, the humour, the animation, the gameplay.  Everything was great.  Please make a sequel and make it a bit longer.  Or maybe even another fairytale oriented game =)","Sep 14, 2020 at 8:14 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:48:46.605586,Shakagenghis,Superb,"This game is so charming.  It is not extremely long, but its creators gave it a lot of love and care.  I think you should buy it.","Sep 11, 2020 at 8:06 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:48:46.621544,OctopusGarden,Overall fun game,"Liking Alice in Wonderland, it gives a unique take on the book in the form of puzzles that are not super simple but not very hard either.   It has a lot of good aspects and has been one of the most played VR games to date.   I like the third person view and like moving the scenery around by grabbing it and moving the entire setup to get better visual of the landscape.  Not saying it's the best but is a really good experience.","Jun 29, 2020 at 2:02 PM",4, 2,"Thanks for your review, OctopusGarden! If you have time, please let us know what we can improve to earn five stars! You can reach us at support@cortopia.com"
2022-05-28 20:48:46.635507,sifi89,Incredible!,"I am a massive fan of Alice in Wonder, so needless to say i've been excited for this game for a long time. I must say, it was worth the wait. I had butterflies the whole way though. Meeting Cheshire and the cast, and even the new 4 1/2 character was amazing. The detail in the worlds and the art style is fantastic! I spent a lot of time admiring the small details. If I were to have one complaint it would be the length, it is pretty darn short. I thought about if the price was steep for the length, and it would be, if it wasn't this quality. I'm so excited to see what this team does next! (Please more adventures in Wonderland!)
Please please buy this and support the devs.","Mar 27, 2020 at 11:50 PM",5, 21,
2022-05-28 20:48:46.650466,anonymous_fox,My wife loves it!,"Haven't played the myself, yet. But my wife played it, and finished it within in several hours. She said she really love the graphic style. She was playing the game in a confined space, so I kept hearing her hitting the walls trying to explore and soak in all the spectacular environment design. (We will move my computer out to the living room where there is more space for her to play this game.) It seems like player choices will yeld different storylines, so she'd like to play the game again to see different storylines, and, of course, enjoy the immersive environment art more freely in a bigger space. She wants the developers to know she would like see more of these kind of games in the future, because she does not enjoy games that kills headcrabs. Great game. Five stars. High five. Recommend.","Apr 1, 2020 at 2:30 PM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 20:48:49.789071,Clickingtoenails,Wow! Beautiful!,Love these types of diarama games. To me it is far more immersive than some of the shooters. I could stay in some of the scenes just to enjoy the artwork!,"Mar 27, 2020 at 11:35 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:48:49.803034,JeremyC85,Very charming!,"This is a ""diorama game"" that is bursting with charm! Its an alternative Alice in Wonderland setting where you control various characters while exploring the setting/story and looking for collectables. Its approximately 2-3 hours long depending on how you take your time soaking it all in. I love it!","Apr 27, 2020 at 3:14 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:49.818992,adamwv,Terrific!,"At first I was weary. I thought the tunnel drop scene would of been better. Once you learn how to move camera around and get past a lot of storylines, the game is epic and very amazing! It is sad when it is over; I wish it was longer. Well worth $20. I'd compare it to Moss; another great game.","Apr 7, 2020 at 12:56 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:49.833951,Jallta,,"Really enjoyable puzzle game. Incredibly immersive world. Has really integrated the use of VR, being able to move around or sit in one place and still explore the world. A little bit short for the cost and replayability is limited. Would certainly buy a sequel!","Apr 4, 2020 at 10:53 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:48:49.848911,taquitobuddy,Cute little puzzle/hidden object game,"This is a nice little puzzle/hidden object game with cute dioramas and pleasant voice acting.

The gamestyle was very good, and made me wish more games would adapt to this kind of style. Not every game would work, but for a story driven puzzler it is really well made. For the short time I got to play it (collected all letters on the first 2 tabs), untill some phone company wanted to have a chat- urgh...
