2022-05-28 15:52:32.146331,Emanuele_Tritone,THIS IS AMAZING but....,"125$ per month???? It's outrageous.

The free version it's just a demo. No export.

The right price would be 29.99$ lifetime. 
1 star would become 5 of course if you lower down this disgraceful price.

I recommend to all of them who put 3, 4 or 5 stars, to review positively the product lowering down it to 1 star to make the devs understand this price is out of this world.","Mar 20, 2021 at 1:53 AM",1, 21,

I've been in 3d Animation for 20 years and have experimented with multiple professional software as I am very passionate about experimentation and am something of a perfectionist, thus I'm always pushing the boundaries of what 3d creation software was designed to do. Then VR went mainstream and after the initial gaming craze had become relatively commonplace, people began to consider virtual reality as a viable means of content creation and art production. Believe me when I say, I tried them all and still couldn't satisfy that urge to have a comfortable creation tool...then I found Tvori and EVERYTHING changed.
For the first time in over 2 decades, I finally understood what it meant to be an Animator and 3D artist. The spatial animation concept was not only intuitively gratifying but the learning curve was exceptionally user friendly. Producing my animation had never been so involving. Putting on that headset and entering my virtual studio was and is always a thrill that consistently fills me with childlike wonderment. I see a lot of people condemn the software with reasons ranging from it's limited finctionality to it's 'steep' price. I used to be one of those people but then I had to ask myself what I thought the true cost of an intuitive spatial animation studio was & will tell you that the amount is a small price to pay when you consider what Tvori does for you. As to it's 'limited' functionality, I would chalk that down to impatience. It is SO MUCH MORE than what it appears to be.
Tvori makes me that child I used to be, playing in my own made up world with my characters and environments and I get to share this with the real world. At the time of writing this review, I'm nearing the completion of my Animated movie: C4RBONS33D and in no small measure has Tvori been a part of that. The ONLY reason I'm not using Tvori for the entire project is because Tvori is still growing and growing FAST.","Oct 16, 2020 at 1:36 PM",5, 17,
