It works beautifully when tethered to the PC but the standalone experience has issues.  There is a very easy to spot menu glitch where extra text appears over the menu making it quite hard to read at times.  Also, when you save a ball in the default Secrets of the Deep table, upon release the flippers stop responding and you always lose that ball.  I still love the game, but if you intend it primarily for Quest standalone, it's important to be informed.","Apr 28, 2021 at 2:00 AM",4, 9,

Not sure why this game specifically doesn't support Virtual Desktop, but would be great if it could be update to be compatible.

The comfort level is high (no moving around) and the controls are so simple. If you're on the fence, just get it. The 3d animations going on around you can be a little distracting, but it's not too bad. I play it sitting down. Only thing for me is with my Oculus Quest being so heavy and having your neck bent forward for so long looking down at the table... Which is not the game's fault. (Will there be an upgrade for the Quest 2?)

One thing though, it doesn't run for me through the Oculus app via virtual desktop, whereas other games do. So I have to play the native Quest version, which is ok, but I'd really like to see the PC version..","Oct 10, 2020 at 8:44 PM",4, 4,

I'm an eighties guy and remember going to the amusement park with my parents and loved pinball machines in the arcade building. I love the fact that you made vr. The machines look so real because you sit or stand right in front of them just like the arcade I remember. What is even cooler, is all the animation and added 3d effects. If you are reading this and love pinball machines, this is a must have series. I purchased this game across 3 platforms now and love it on every machine, but the vr experience brings it to another level. Developers, keep up the great work and I look forward to more fantastic vr tables. Maybe a terminator or ghostbuster table would be cool in  vr.","Apr 8, 2020 at 4:56 PM",5, 4,

I do have a few suggestions. I have a rift S and the Right flipper control on the Back to the future game is slow in responding.  I thought it was a rift issue however however the right flipper issue it only occurs on this table. Please allow more than 3 tables that can be selected at any one time.  I bought your expansive pack and have to switch constantly between games that it want to play.  And if you can get bumping the machine that would be the altimate experience.

2022-05-28 13:05:02.043045,Atoner,Slow help from busy devs,"I love pinball - have been a fan for over thirty five years, and I love this game - but this is a big issue: there appears to be a ""ghosting"" issue on the flippers if you try to use them while they're not in view.  During multiball sequences I have to constanty look at the flippers to make sure they connect, as otherwise the orbs just goes straight through.
This can be very frustrating, especially if you're confident at gauging silver orbs whereabouts on the table during play.
Oh, and a new bug - for me - my left trigger is very very lazy to respond.  Until about a week ago both triggers were perfect - now my left trigger only reacts to one out of every dozen or so presses.  Trigger works on every other game, flawlessly, but with this I'm forced to use left grip button (which works perfect too) but that kind of ruins the symmetry of the experience.  Is there anything I can do to reset or fix this without having to uninstall the game?
Thanks for any help you can offer.
Update: Took a while but the devs emailed me on this, by which time either an update or some file setting within the code had changed and all is good with the left trigger again.","Jul 16, 2019 at 12:52 AM",4, 9,"Hi Atoner!

The flippers do not respond to trigger pulls on the touch controllers. The game info states the game is compatible with touch as a game controller. I emailed Zen about the issue, and I'm awaiting a response. Until then, do not waste your money. I also purchased the Universal tables, so I'm out over $35 on an unplayable game.

2022-05-28 13:05:05.214688,VibrationsOfDoom,UPDATE! Fourh time is the absolute charm,"Okay, so out of frustration, I deleted and reinstalled this program four times now... And lo and behold, on the fourth day it worked!! Let me just say that the three times it failed there was no .exe file in the folder it's supposed to be downloaded to, so MAKE SURE you aren't running any other games or programs in the Rift headset when you download this. I think their servers are either buggy or lagged...

But let's get to the game! Dang, this is easily THE BEST pinball game out there for the Rift. And yes, I LOVE Stern Pinball, but this one!! The locations CHANGE with each table you load; it was amazing in the Deep table to see sharks swimming around and an underwater motiff looking out the windows! Same with E.T., where you watch E.T. walk around you while you play and actually talk! And the MARS table, man, you see an outer space scene right next to you! Lots of floating asteroids, and at certain times a spider comes out (looks like some weird alien spider) and walks across the top of the pinball cabinet and crawls down the side of it! Cool too to look underneath the pinball table!

Game mechanics are quite solid, though you press the bottom trigger buttons for flippers instead of the top. And yes, you'll find the tables a bit easier to play than Stern, but there are LOADS of ""missions"" and things to see and do. It's Zen Pinball, and they make top shelf pinball games...

My only complaint is that the tables are a bit too low even when you hit the X button to ""reposition"" them. So my advice is; stand up, position the table with the X and then kneel down. You'll get a pretty sweet view that way. But beware! You hit X again and it will ""bring the table"" down to your level. HIGHLY recommended pinball game, man the graphics and all the multitudes of details make each and EVERY pinball table worth having, right down to the sandy beach and waves lapping at your feet while playing Jaws (incidentally, losing a ball on the Jaws table you will see a shark munching floor!)","Feb 22, 2019 at 8:59 AM",5, 2,

Make a full standing pinball controller that we can buy.  Make the controller have force feedback so we can feeel the bumpers and slinkshots etc. and make sure the stand allone controller supports nudgging the table.

Just go to control settings (at the big screen) and reconfigure if you want.

Also PROTIP for Oculus Touch users:
The game manifest (or whatever it is) is outdated and if you use Oculus Touch, the xbox gamepad simulation kicks in (I personally don't like it).
But the game supports Oculus Touch without simulation!
To make it work, turn off/unplug any real xbox controllers, run the game and then go to Windows' device manager->Xbox 360 Peripherals->right click the active controller and choose ""Disable"". It will prompt you to restart the PC but decline, close the game and restart it. Now the simulated xbox controller is disabled and the game picks up Oculus Touch controllers.","Jun 12, 2018 at 4:45 AM",5, 18,

Why dream of owning your own pinball table when you can have an arcade full of them!
This was absolutely SUPERB! The tables feel real and come to life in ways you can only imagine.
If you have a VR headset I cannot recommend this game enough!!!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGyWMp46BdE

A quick rundown of the new DLC tables:
 
The ET table didn't seem to have a lot of interaction, but ET looked cool and I never managed to pull off a multi-ball.

The Jaws table was well designed with some interesting animations and the shark swimming around you whilst playing was quite unnerving.

The Back to the Future table was superb with multiple modes based on all 3 of the films. The highlight of this table was the DeLorean flying around you as you play.","Jun 3, 2018 at 10:24 PM",5, 3,

With the game you get the included 3 tables which are all fun and great for some casual gaming. There is a pack of 4 tables and a single table for like 5$ each as DLC. Expensive? I had fed lots of more cash in pinball machines at the arcade. So this is bargain in VR. There is a small bug, you need to set tilt to steering pad for Touch and the tilt function is available at the left stick. Set tilt to left stick if you want to use the steering pad of your x-box controller. I keep hitting the X-Button (recenter) by accident, which is quite annoying during a session.

2022-05-28 13:05:14.737062,itsmedrew,Perfect!!,"EDIT 06/09/19: Rift S support is not there yet. Freezes and crashes everytime, you can manage to get it back for a second by hitting pause or oculus menu but a few seconds later freezes again until fatal error. Disappointed and debating on returning the rift s until later when games adapt. Dropping to 2 stars until I'm able to play again.

A favorite amongst friends and family. This game I can play longer periods of time and not feel sick or burning eyes. They do need tilt and move the table options as looking down for long periods of time hurts the neck.

TIP TO CASUAL GAMERS: Read the rules of the table before playing. It makes the game so much more fun. For example the epic quest table, learn how to select the monsters, kill the monsters, use potions etc and then it feels like you're not even playing pinball but some sort of RPG.

UPDATE: Still wishing I had tilt control, as seeing a helpless ball teetering between impending doom or a continued fight against a giant rat is madening to watch without any control. Sounds of this game are redic good. $20 for the universal pack at first seems steep but just one table adds tons of hours.","Jun 21, 2019 at 9:02 AM",1, 3,"Hi itsmedrew! Thanks for your feedback!

I like to have a well rounded VR library. This VR Pinball game adds to the variety from which I get to choose. 

The games inside are engaging and fun.  I picked this up on a Daily Deal for less than $5. The DLC's are not badly priced. The Walking Dead was $5.99 and the Season 1 pack was $24.99. I think the Season 1 pack contains 5 different machines, not including The Walking Dead. So, for $5 a piece, it's not a bad deal. 

How many of us have jammed more than $5 worth of quarters into pinball machines when we were kids. Well, with that same investment, you can play them as many times as you want, when you want, at home, in your undies, with an icy-cold beverage. The Touch controllers worked perfectly from the start.

The graphics are great, the machines look great, the physics of the pinball machines are well done.  You only get 3 tables and IMHO only two are really interesting and make me want to play them repeatedly, but having said that, they didn't cut any corners in making this game and the quality shines through.   This is one that you'll probably want to have in your collection because A) the pinball looks fantastic (as do the environments around each pinball machine), and B) this is one of those games you'll want in your arsenal when doing a demo for a first time VR person (won't make them nauseous and great graphics, etc).   I was torn on whether to give it 4 or 5 stars because I only like 2 of the 3 tables, plus I can't figure out how to adjust the height.  The default height after you center the view is pretty far above the table for my tastes, so I have to compensate by raising my office chair, loading the game, then dropping the office chair once I'm in the game.  I ended up giving it 5 stars though, it's really nice.  It's a shame that the other tables you can add to it cost so much, though.","Mar 15, 2018 at 1:16 PM",5, 4,

Being able to play a ball or two on a DLC table would enable me to judge whether it was worth my money - but as the only DLC I bought I really dislaiked (The Walking Dead table), I have come to the conclusion that buying any further table is like a lucky dip, whether my money will be thrown away or not.

That said, it has its flaws:
If playing sitting down you end up craning your neck looking down at your navel as you can't change the angle of the table. This is terrible for peoples posture. I have built myself a PinSim so I can stand up and rest my hands and body against something physical which is a lot more ergonomic, but I shouldn't have to go that route.

There are no options for supersampling in the game.

The lobby for the game is a massive impressive futuristic apartment, but with all that space it can only house 3 pinball tables, so if you buy any of the expensive DLC tables, you have to manually go into a menu to swap out the 3 you want to be active. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.

You can't see the current score while playing, you have to wait until the end.

LAST UPDATE!!! I made a small woodworking project that improove the immersion... shortly I made the real table like wooden box with buttons (width 70cm) and connected them to XBOX pad! The buttons are very similar to the ones used in real flippers. Feels really great.","Nov 30, 2016 at 1:33 AM",5, 10,

This is as close as it gets to playing real life pinball. Can't wait for them to release more tables!!","Jan 22, 2017 at 12:39 AM",5, 1,

Combined with a VR pinball cabinet controller and this is the closest you will get to playing a real pinball machine. Hopefully more tables come to the game in the future.,"Jan 9, 2017 at 11:27 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 13:05:52.682042,jmalmsten,My most used app,"I remember when I was young. My parents had a 486 and on it was Pinball Fantasies. My friends and I spent so many hours on that. And here I am. And if there is one app in the Oculus Library that I always return to it is this. It's simple. Yet. Challanging in the good way. There are pitfalls that I get so frustrated by. But at the same time I keep loading it up. Allthough, one thing that really helped with the feel of the game was when I opened the options and saw that there's a switch to turn the ball-trail off. I really got distracted by the trail. If there's one big thing I would change it's the lobby area. Why can't I have more than 3 tables there? It really takes away from the arcade feeling when not all of the tables are present and viewable. :/","Dec 2, 2016 at 5:02 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 13:05:52.697999,lordneep,VR Adds so much,"I loved me some Zen Pinball on my PS3. I got it on my 3DS and was blown away by how much 3D actually added to pinball. Unlike other games, 3D didn't feel gimmicky at all. Being able to see depth in the tables made the game a lot easier to figure out what was going on with tables, ramps, rails, etc. VR takes that all to the next level. The Zen tables come to complete life infront of you. The sound effects really seal the deal and get you feeling like you're standing in front of an actual pinball machine. Tables like Paranormal that get you looking up and away from the normal play area only add to the immersion more. Basically, I feel stupid for playing so much pinball in VR as it feels like a waste of potential, but holy hell does it add so much more to the genre than it has any right to. If you have even a casual interest in pinball do yourself a favor and buy this immediately. Then try and beat my high scores!","Sep 15, 2016 at 4:52 PM",5, 6,
