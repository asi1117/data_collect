2022-05-28 18:36:36.321266,taquitobuddy,Good if you like job sim type games,"Of all the VR games simulating working/a job this is probably the best, so if you like that sort of game I can recommend it.  I don't enjoy fake-working myself.  I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could, what keeps it from 3 is that there seems to be no in-game options, a couple playspace issues, and annoying constantly repeating voice-overs.","Jan 3, 2019 at 12:38 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:36:36.336226,Seakayaker,,Its a fun game but it has some issues.     The game does crash occasionally.  I only wish it would give you more feed back on what you need to do better on each levels.  Its a great game  and its  fun to play.   You may have to experiment  with where to stand  inside you Guardian space.  I found that if i stand directly in hte center I would have to reach outside of the zone  and hit my desk.   This can be easly fixed by standing just to the right of the center of the zone,"Jul 13, 2018 at 12:05 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:36:36.351186,Darkdrive,"Good, but a game breaking bug","So far, it's a really good game. I like the artstyle, and the premise, and a lot of other things. Some things I don't like, things like the stress level. I may be doing my job wrong and thats causing my stress to increase, so a feedback feature in-game would be nice, so you know what your doing wrong. The game breaking bug, which I call the ""0 Timer Bug"", is where you enter a level, and the timer is at zero. When the passengers approach, they stop at the end of the cones, put their arms up, and dissapear. The only fix is to restart the game. It's also really common. Overall, it's a pretty good game.","Jun 6, 2018 at 6:11 AM",3, 5,"Hi Darkdrive, thank you so much for your feedback! We are aware of this bug and are currently working on fixing it. Stay tuned, we will have an update tomorrow."
