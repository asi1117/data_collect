2022-05-28 20:48:22.167948,Satconcook,In a world of many rythm VR games....,"With so many different rhythm VR games out there, you can’t help but to compare this one to some others. This is more like SynthRiders in the way the notes come at you and you ride a couple trail notes every once in a while. However, this just feels really generic in that the balls just need to touch your sticks and the bell sound effect. The demo only allows easy mode on 2 songs, however that was enough to show what this game has to offer. I do like the music video screen, but other than that it’s average at best.","May 21, 2020 at 12:46 PM",3, 6,
