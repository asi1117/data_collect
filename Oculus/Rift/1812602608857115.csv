2022-05-28 15:17:09.398877,GodsForeskin,Amazing Game,My favorite puzzle game for vr by farrrrr it’s such a unique concept and I played it all in one go and would die for a sequel,"Nov 23, 2020 at 10:49 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:17:09.412840,Mr-Chris,Amazing game,"This exelent mind twisted game deserves full five stars, the only reason that I give it just four, is that the game is just too short..","Oct 7, 2020 at 9:36 PM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 15:17:09.441762,NariousTalonborne,Good but too short.,The game is interesting and has fun dynamics. BUT the game is incredibly short...like I have played game demos that were 5 times longer. Expect maybe an hour of game time - two max if you get stuck on the puzzles. Most of the puzzles are very easy with only two or three causing you to think much about them. Worth buying but I wouldn't pay more than $7 due to the length.,"May 27, 2020 at 5:52 PM",3, 2,

Way too short. about 2 hours. Maybe. Don't get me wrong, it was an incredible 2 hours. But I need more. I want more. I'm empty inside.","Apr 13, 2020 at 2:58 AM",5, 16,

2022-05-28 15:17:15.769837,j01r1de,Entertaining Game,"I found this game to be really immersive and entertaining. Some of the controls were a little hard to get used to (a little annoying why gaming companies can't agree on some basics, like standardizing on controls for moving around a room and interacting with objects is a little frustrating - but I won't hold it against the game). The puzzels were engaging and just challenging enough to be fun. The scenery and graphics were awesome. 5 starts for creativity on the story line as well.","Dec 30, 2019 at 4:23 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:17:18.942352,Irengard,Awesome game with a great atmosphere,"Great game with a very interesting story.  Puzzles are quite easy but fun nonetheless.  
I honestly had little trouble with the controls, but indeed, they could be better.  When you extend your hand, once you pick up something, your best to retract your hands before moving.  If for any reason you did drop something by mistake, the item would respawn at it's original place after a few seconds.

The game isn't long (maybe an hour of play) but well worth the price when on sale.","Oct 23, 2019 at 12:17 PM",5, 4,

The controls aren't perfect (I didn't have too much of an issue however) and the game is a bit short for the price. However the game earns its price because it is fantastic. The visual are stunning. The world within a world within a world gameplay is mind bending. The story deserves extra special mention because it has one (rare for VR games) and it is great and moving and interesting. This is easily one of the best VR games. A must buy. Great job developers!,"Oct 8, 2019 at 11:48 PM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 15:17:22.123842,SparkyNinja1583,Charming and cute,I got it on sale. Definitely pick this one up if it's on sale. Up to you if it's worth the full 15. I usually relate games and their prices to movies and their prices. I could easily spend 15 bucks at a movie theatre and see a so-so probably forgetful movie.  If I get a couple hours out of a game that I enjoyed quite a bit I'd say it's money well spent for the entertainment. What you're getting is a nicely polished and charming game. The puzzles were neat and not crazy complicated. Music and narration was very well done also. Nice job!,"Aug 14, 2019 at 3:11 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:17:25.207594,Satconcook,Fun play on scale,"This is what VR was made for. Giving a whole new meaning to scale. I love the mechanics of this game and the story to go along with it. However, way too short of an experience. Also, the way some things clip and then vanish is a bit obnoxious. However, glad they eventually come back to their original spawn point a bit after that though.","Aug 14, 2019 at 8:38 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:17:25.223552,Comrade_Ivan,Loved the game; hated the game,"No greater game has ever been so devastatingly ruined by poor control design choice. Items that constantly keep getting stuck in walls are a direct product of jarring hand extending and lack of free locomotion option.
Such a waste though. The scaled gameplay idea is nothing short of amazing, but the janky mechanics turn every pleasure into a frustrating experience.
I somehow lasted through the entire game, but every time I've been asked about it, my answer has been the same - amazing game; don't waste your money!","Aug 7, 2019 at 3:52 PM",1, 2,"Hello, we're sorry to hear that you were frustrated because of the controls in the game, but for your information, we recently made an update to improve navigation, and collision system which should avoid most of the issues related to the controls! 
Unfortunately it was a bit too complex to build a free locomotion system after having made the whole game around teleport sytem already, so we had to skip that one. But will keep that in mind fo our next project :)
Anyway, we thank you for trying A fisherman's tale and hope you will be willing to play it again some day!"

THe saving grace is the story, its really good and the characters and the idea of the game but the controls just kill it completely. I mean COME ON ALREADY!!! WHAT IN THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So yes I'm frustrated because I really loved the story and the idea but the execution really brought it way down for me.","Jul 5, 2019 at 11:34 AM",2, 1,"Hello, we're sorry you had so much trouble playing the game but for your information, we recently made an update to improve navigation, controls, and collision system which should avoid this kind of inconvenience now!

2022-05-28 15:17:28.366146,JeremyC85,Short but magical,"Beat the game in less than 2 hours and was only truly stumped once (some puzzles were challenging but only once I was totally stumped)
That being said, VERY unique game that is truely magical! shows off what VR can do. Its very short for 15$ but worth it IMO. Expecially worth it if you catch it on sale","Jun 4, 2019 at 10:05 AM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 15:17:28.396067,john.c.linstrum,Inventive concept very well executed,"The main character is a puppet within a model, and within that model is another model, but the original model is also within a model. It's kind of mind blowing. You have to use the relationship between the models to solve the game. The puzzles involved are very clever and use the base concept well but they're not terribly hard. If you get stuck the narrator eventually gives you hints, and if you misplace anything important it eventually pops back to where it started.

Aside from the gameplay there's also an underlying storyline which is very well done, and both the gameplay and the story build to a moving climax. It's kind of a short game (took me maybe 3 hours?), but it's worth the price.

Slight warning: I'm new to VR and after about an hour all the changes in view using the stick and teleporting from place to place made me a tad queezy. If you're new too you might not want to try to win this game in one session. ;)","May 28, 2019 at 10:54 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:17:28.412024,JDakotaPowell,Amazing and inventive,"While other reviewers have already commented on the excellent gameplay and graphics, I would further mention that the character of the fisherman is enchanting. You enter his little room in the lighthouse and immediately get a sense of who he is - wooden teeth and all. The writing is strong - the narrative drives the gameplay - and it's just wonderful.","May 22, 2019 at 12:04 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:17:28.426984,mch_zh,Awesome game design,"Probably the most interesting game design If tried so far, interacting with your own on different realities/scales. Nice puzzles. Graphics are very nice, french accent tres bien. I walked through in 1.5h. Hints are pretty helpful, after 5min of not progressing you'll get clear hints. So I recommend to deactivate game hints  and enjoy the puzzles. 
Because it is pretty short, 4 stars would be fair. Rating 5 stars to encourage developers come up with a sequel.","May 22, 2019 at 5:50 AM",5, 0,

I wish it was longer (hoping the devs are going to make a sequel or just another game) and sometimes the physics got a little weird, But nothing that ever made me quit playing it. Overall my biggest complaint is that it is short and I want more, but for the price of a movie ticket I got plenty of enjoyment out of it.","Jan 24, 2019 at 1:35 AM",4, 29,

It has an amazing concept, great art style, and excelent gameplay.  The levels well thought out and almost never leave you completely stuck.  The model idea is extremely cool and fun to mess around with as well.  Basically, the entire game is just extremely fun and worth the cost.  The only thing I wish this game had is more levels/playtime.  This game is a 5/5 no doubt about it.","Mar 2, 2019 at 3:51 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 15:17:34.703198,gamerguy_9601,A really good game but short,"Averything from the sound, mechanics, story to the design is amazing.
You should know that you are buying a puzzle game that stands out from all
of the other puzzle games in terms of basically amerything. 
The only thing that i am a bit sad about is the game time, i beat it in about an hour so it is not that long.
If you like puzzle games this is a must buy, and for me the 15 dollars is fine but a bit on the expensive side becuse of the the short time it took to beat it and on the other side it is the best puzzle game i have ever tried.

All in all it is a bit short but amazing and is totally worth the price if you are intrested in puzzle games. I hope this advise will help you make a good choise!","Mar 15, 2019 at 3:15 AM",4, 0,

The graphics are top notch and the story telling is interesting. I definitely recommend the game, but feel like a 8-10 euro price point would be more suitable considering the limited play duration.

It's short but sweet and worth it in my opinion.  This is what you call thinking outside the box and utilizing VR in ways most of us wouldn't have imagined.

2022-05-28 15:17:41.014317,Hanover,BUGGY.  Can get into unwinnable states.,"This game is infuriating.  It's way too easy to get objects stuck in walls, or have them fall through the floor so that the you're forced to re-start a level because the boat you're supposed to put in the water ends up sinking out of reach.  I had to restart THREE LEVELS because of this.  Sometimes you might even get objects you're holding stuck in walls because they hit them as you turn.  It's too bad because otherwise, this looks like it could have been a charming experience, instead, it's just way too frustrating.

Sorry, I'm demanding my money back.  This game is still early access candidate at best and NOT ready for a full release!","Feb 17, 2019 at 9:19 AM",1, 2,"Hello, we're sorry you had so much trouble playing the game but for your information, we recently made an update to improve navigation, controls, and collision system which should avoid this kind of inconvenience now!

2022-05-28 15:17:41.030274,gtasick,"Extremely Well Done, Short","This game is one of the most polished and cohesive VR games I've played thus far. The mechanic and visuals of scale was a lot of fun and solving the related puzzels was really rewarding. Only down side, it's really short and I completed it in about 2 hours. I want more of this.","Feb 16, 2019 at 11:41 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:17:41.046232,RuneSR2,Mind-blowing/bending amazing!,"Just tried the game - it was an awesome experience, even better than I had hoped for. There're really no settings in the game - you can only choose between seated, sitting or room scale. But that's kinda great, because it means that all details have been designed for the lowest common denominator - and that users of high-end video cards can crank up super sampling (ss) to the max and still enjoy solid 90 fps. 
If you got GTX 1080 or better, do set ss to 2.0 using Oculus Tray Tool, and the graphics are greatly improved. This approach by the devs is brilliant - meaning that this game will work on all Oculus compatible rigs - and you only need 4GB system ram to run Fisherman's Tale! Owners of GTX 980/1060 should be able to enjoy ss 1.5 in this game or close and still get 90 fps. 
Game play is like an utterly mind-blowing puzzle or adventure game. You're more or less inside a fairy tale, performing and supporting the story while it's told. This game is highly original and fully supports Touch as you have to pick up and handle several items. I believe this game was primarily made for Touch and PCVR, even though it's also available for PSVR (meaning you don't need a fast cpu for this game). 
Maybe some don't like that you can only teleport, but since this an adventure game in small locations, teleportation works well. I'm using roomscale, and due to the small in-game locations, I often walk around (it's just a few feet/meters).  
This is a highly polished game - it's not scary and kinda makes you feel good. It's pure escapism. It may be a rather short game, so don't rush through this game, take your time and enjoy every minute - it may a while before something better arrives. I have not completed the game, but if the quality of the first levels represents the rest of this game, it's definitely a 9/10 - or better!","Jan 23, 2019 at 6:20 AM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 15:17:44.129984,cheatz,Escaperoom Metaphysics + French Puppetry,"Let me say that this game felt like a work of art that you got to play with, more than a game. I'll break down the elements of the game that struck me as worthwhile for review: 

**Story**
I love the warm and cozy naration and characters in the game, save for the Blue Fish. He's annoying, but I'll forgive the developers that as I hate almost every JarJar character for comic relief. The game is VERY French, and polished with such ""fragrance."" Reminded me a lot of what Pinocchio would be like in other cultures. There's not a whole lot of depth to the storyline, and its very metaphysical so you may not get it, but to that I suggest don't overthink it. 

**Metaphysical Space**
This is the kind of sh*t we cannot experience in our own reality. As many rewiews suggest, there's metaphysical games that you have to solve where you have to interact in realities that intersect but at different scale. If you have no idea what I just typed, I suggest you just buy the game and try it out because its 100% worth it. 

**Gamification** 
Once you understand the metaphics of each puzzle its quite easy to solve. This felt more like a virtual escape room if I was gonna tie it down to any previous experience. The puzzles were about a 5/10 difficulty. With hints on, anyone in highschool or above should be able to figure it out. No math requirments but you literally have to think outside the box for one of the puzzles. There's only 5 chapters of story with about 20 puzzles ranging in difficulty.  

**Pricepoint**
Its rude to call anything French ""cheap"" but fk me if this game isn't ""inexpensive."" Its about 3 hours of content, and a great plug-and-play for guests who come over regularly. For 15-20 bucks its better than anything else you could be doing with your life... lets be real. 

Final thoughts: A+ game. Worth every $, Minute, and thought spent playing.","Feb 9, 2019 at 1:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:17:44.144944,nrosko,Not enough options.,"Yet again a game with great potential but a lack of options. You can choose sitting standing or roomscale. I always liked pc games because they had options, options for controls & graphics are standard in pretty much every pc game i have played. Yet in VR many devs think options are bad. 
Sorry to be so negative but i was really looking forward to this title & just find it frustrating. Teleporting around a little space is horrible & for me the control scheme is irksome. If you are offering a sitting experience then you should offer a crouch & free movement in such a game. 
Apart from that It's a beautiful idea & nicely presented & maybe its just me being fussy. I think if you play it roomscale it probably works much better. 
The price is also very reasonable, i don't think its going to be a long game but i still probably think its worth the money if you get on with the controls.   
I am going to put this to one side though & hope the devs can improve it.","Feb 9, 2019 at 3:29 PM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 15:17:47.306488,theregoes2,Really Cool Experience,"The ideas for the puzzles in this game are just really cool and the experience is novel and thrilling. It's definitely worth a play. I don't want to spoil the main mechanic but it was absolutely genius, in my opinion. Some of the puzzles are a bit tough to know what you're supposed to do, but the narrator will eventually drop hints. 

I have played a bit over an hour I think and I'm still not done, so it's longer than I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. Honestly, I'm not sure it needs to be any longer. They have a cool idea and they explore it pretty thoroughly in the time they gave us. If the game were several hours long I'd probably be tired of it.

The idea is fresh and great, they actually managed to create something I would call an atmosphere which most vr Games lack in my opinion.

The voice over is class as well, very well done, some people moaned about teleporting but I got no issues with it in this type of game, plus I like all forms of movement in VR.

The section with the winch was quite buggy, and I had to quit and restart that chapter once as the line started jumping uncontrollably all over. Other than that, no real issues!

A cute story and some fun characters, I would love to see more from the DEVS in this vein. Price? Down a Star.

The story reminds me of the formating of the classic short stories - and that I loved.

It's also a game that I think could only really work as well as it does in VR - the idea of scale is key to the game, and that's something that you only really get in VR.

Also, it's beautiful - especially the water and associated effects. As the credits rolled I found myself just looking around and admiring the scenery.

The only criticism for me is the length of the experience - I took my time and still finished it in around 3 hours. That said, I'm not knocking a star off for it, the game tells a story that feels complete, and I suspect I'll come back and play it through again after a while just to enjoy it once more.","Jan 27, 2019 at 12:34 AM",5, 0,

This is just next level for VR. The story was short and sweet, the puzzles made you think, but not too hard. The graphics looked great all throughout. 

My only problem is the lack of control options such as smooth movement and turning. So I'm knocking off 2 stars for each, there's no excuse not to add such options to VR games. Still, I absolutely implore you to buy and play this one, it's truly spectacular!","Jan 27, 2019 at 5:49 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 15:18:12.625769,ccdeltabeta,Charming.....If Brief,"A charming 'escape the room' type of game, where different scaled versions of your play area are used to help you escape to the next part of the game.  It was almost if there was a mirror image of your play area in front of you that was smaller, and the mirror image behind you was larger, and you had to combine the different image scales to help solve the puzzle.
The atmosphere was absolutely delightful, as cozy as relaxing in your favorite chair, and the various touches of humor made it even more relaxing.
The games main crime, however, is its length. Like getting a taste of cheesecake, then the waiter taking it away before you could get another bite. It took me 50 minutes to get through it at a slow pace (the only way I could ahve made it longer is if I stared and picked up every item I could).  Other minor crimes includes the following: (1) if you use room scale, a 4m x 4m size is recommended; anything less and you are likely to activate your Oculus Boundry Walls on a regular basis, (2) Teleportation and snap turning were the only way to get around; locomotion and smooth turning would have fit this game well, (3)  Occassional wonky handling of items in your hand when making contact with other item.
