2022-05-28 13:55:45.442258,Dropla,Great Experience~if you read description,"This is a great experience that delievers exactly what it says. Guided meditation, in the language it is listed in the description, English. They should offer more, I agree, but, giving it a lesser review because you chose not to read is silly. It frustrates me, when people give bad ratings for things, that aren't desreved, so, my apologies if this comes off a little sour, I'll meditate on it haha. Either way, for now, I would recommend using tools that oculus offers, our desktop, open something like youtube, and open your favorite guided meditation in your preferred language & use that, it works great, I have used some music I like, in place of having the meditation or music from the app running. You can adjust all of it in settings. I sometimes just sit in places I like with the little glowey light effect with the music on, it's very relaxing to me. You can turn the volume down on the app & turn on a meditation you want, if there is something you find outside of the app you want to experience while gliding through one of the places. I hope they will eventually add more areas or effects. There is one called Kamea, that was abandoned that had a chakra effect I liked, I wished this one had. HOPE VR has one as well that I enjoy, for now, I use a mix of all three, depending on what I am in the mood for. I have purchased this one as gifts for friends & family that I know are going through hard times, because I know this will help. I even recommended my therapist check it out, so, she might be able to use it as a tool for others or possibly create a theraputic session she could add to it. It's one of the top of my list for VR meditation & the 1st ones recommend every time. As for people upset it isn't cross platform, the reason being, devs have to re-code things to be on the Quest, this wasn't originally coded for the Q, it was a Rift item. A 2nd set of code is required for Q. I think thats why some apps we have to pay for again, it's different code to get it to work",Apr 16 at 3:32 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:55:45.458215,tonyvr99,Have to buy twice,"I had purchased this from the rift store last year when using my Quest 2 with the link cable. It's very lame now that it was ported to the Quest 2 that I would have to repurchase it for Quest, rather than being able to download it like other games allow that are in both stores. This app is decent but certainly not worth having to buy it twice.",Jan 26 at 10:20 AM,2, 14,
2022-05-28 13:55:45.474173,relaxculus,Should be Crossbuy,"I already bought this app for my CV1, and now i have to pay the full price for use it on my Q2? Come on, give us a little discount at least. Thank you!",Dec 19 at 3:33 PM,2, 20,
2022-05-28 13:55:45.488136,J007s,Why not cross play.,"I brought this ages ago, and while I have enjoyed it, it has always needed to be cross play. Today it came out on quest and.. ... I have to buy it again. That totally sucks ! Poor move. You should reward early adopters.",Oct 23 at 1:03 AM,3, 40,
2022-05-28 13:55:45.505090,DAC_Protogen,Great use case for VR,"I like the music and general direction they take with this app. It is easy to use and a highly customizable experience. At the time of this review, it is still in early access and it shows in some areas, some music doesn't loop cleanly without a short gap of silence, some foliage is placed in a sloppy way, clipping through the ground or objects, some trees have distracting and visible pop-in, even at high graphics settings and the teleport controls allow you to teleport out of the map. But overall, the meditation quality seems to be there, and the design of the environments is pretty. With a bit of polish, this will become a highly recommendable app.",Feb 18 at 10:13 PM,4, 0,
