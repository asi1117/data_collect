2022-05-28 19:48:10.262252,MonsterMachine,Needs work,"I tried the tutorial as it keeps starting me as a student. I can not get the ghost bird to direct me, it freezes next to the first crystal. If I go forward on my own it works I guess. I can not upgrade the crystal no matter how many times I do the crystal grinding. it just floats there after with no way I see to select it for the staff. I am unsure what the wood grinding was for, I saved my design but in the next area I draw and 3d print. so I am assuming I should have selected it with my staff to replace like the 3d printing did but different ways to do it. Not sure but no directions without the bird and no videos found to help. If i go back, i go back to a student area for the next steps except once when I ended up in a different area, the area I want to be in with different areas to visit. When reloading I am stuck as a student again. If I drop out it exits the game. If i go through the portal before completing the steps I end up on the main student menu. Nothing is saved when I go back except the staff shape from the print out. The process is to long to go through every time I wanna play. Can I get conformation that updates are still being done for this game, otherwise I would like a refund. I can wait some for fixes but if none are comeing a refund would be nice. I gave 3 stars because it looks fun, but I have yet to really play.

I am on the Oculus Rift S on Windows 10","Oct 21, 2019 at 5:47 AM",3, 2,"hey MonsterMachine, thanks for trying this game out.  i haven't posted an update to this game in quite some time, but i hope to continue patching here and there throughout this year.  the tutorial can be completed, but i realize it's sort of buggy at the moment.  once i work out those bugs in the tutorial, the rest of the game is pretty accessible. and once the tutorial is completed, the player starts in their castle from that point on, but i need to smooth out those hiccups in getting there."
2022-05-28 19:48:10.277212,netshaman,Good concept but lacking some interest,"First i love this original concept of making your own staff and spells, carving crystals, and travelling into new worlds by the observatory , but at the moment it seems to not have a real interest because there is no real challenge or quests, ennemies are weak and their AI is simple, well this will surely be improved in a near future; motion sickness is present , it's weird because you don't use natural motion but teleportation, i hope you will find a true mean to have some quests and a background story for each world you visit , keep up the good work ! Are you a one man dev ?If it is the case , so bravo for this original piece of software :)","Nov 29, 2017 at 7:53 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:48:10.292172,cybernettr,,"Nice environments, great concept, regular updates and a mine cart ride that is as good as some stand-alone rollercoaster apps make this a stand out. Unfortunately, the developer doesn't seem to know where he is going with this. The addition of a tutorial was a nice touch, but the object of the game is still unclear. Frequent updates regularly give you something new to try, but each one erases your existing game progress. Spell casting and wand crafting are nice ideas, but the enemies are already pretty easy to defeat, and doing so offers little reward. The shopkeeper in the town always tells you to ""Come back tomorrow."" Actions are unintuitive. Flicking a book's pages with your in-game hands to turn them would be intuitive; unfortunately, you must press an easy-to-forget button instead. Things that used to work get broken with some updates, such as the ability to get close enough to the blackboard to activate it. And why was in-game rotation turned into an option? It's hard to figure out a game when the developer doesn't even seem to know where it's going.","Nov 6, 2017 at 12:23 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:48:10.307132,Xyatsue01,navigation issue is back?,"so they did an update that fixed the navigation system to something much more managable. then they did another update. now all the improvements are gone. What happened? the last update fixed the problem I was having with the bookmark tutorial, but now my navigation ability has been downgraded again. now I am unable to turn at all unless I stand up and physically turn around. I have had this game since it first came out and I have yet to be able to play it. I have a physical condition that makes standing to play vr games very uncomfortable. even painful. There are days when I can barely turn my head due to damaged disks in my neck. I need to be able to use the controller to turn. can I just get my money back?","Oct 10, 2017 at 7:11 AM",1, 0,"what's up Xyatsue, in the main menu, under settings, and then controls, you can select a forward facing mode to enable the 90-degree turning.  if you contact info@earthborninteractive.com , i can address your refund request.  thanks for your feedback."
2022-05-28 19:48:13.440385,stardm77,I love open world magic based games,"However, this game is not intuitive.  I couldn't learn spells or craft things even with multiple attempts.  The tutorials are not enough to explain the game, and the mechanics are just basic.  I didn't mind the teleporting so much as the fact that the spells weren't as powerful as the turret and other spells that cost no mana!!! what is the use of finding things that were less powerful, and cost mana?!  I just don't understand. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 3 or 4 is because I went to the different places to try to learn spells, and after finding the scrolls for the spells... you don't learn them.","Jun 16, 2017 at 1:13 AM",2, 2,"Thanks for your feedback @stardm77 !
The drones are currently unlocked for testing, and are much more powerful than the usual spells. At full release, they will need to be discovered.  I am currently debating whether to use collected crystals as a cost to summon drones, or a higher mana cost.  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this! I will be sure to develop a more comprehensive tutorial for the introduction.  The spells seemed to unlock ok when I played the latest release.  Do you recall which spell was problematic?  Thanks again for your feedback, and giving MageWorks a go!"
