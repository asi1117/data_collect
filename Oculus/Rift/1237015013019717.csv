One, it's the only horse racing or riding VR app I've found, and two, there are a lot more tracks to chose from, even a dressage finale.

The bad, obviously, having to mash your A button kills your thumb and controller fast. And the dressage finale is just plain broken, the horse can't get up enough speed to jump the hurdles and either balks or gets stuck.

The good? Four tracks per season with different locations, times of day and weather conditions. This could have been shaved down to each location with weather and day/time controls, but it's there. It is kind of fun in its own broken way, but it seriously needs fixed so you don't have to mash the A button constantly.","Aug 12, 2020 at 2:21 AM",2, 4,

Well, I was able to get this game to work using an Xbox One Controller only. Unfortunately, then I had to play the game. The visuals are ugly, the gameplay is boring & repetitive, and the menus are clunky to navigate. I also didn't like the music.
