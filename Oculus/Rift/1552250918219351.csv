2022-05-28 19:38:27.790553,MarcoBad,Absolut garbage,"Really? This is based on science? No, this is based on the level of attention and the promptness of reflexes. Stop. Nothing else. There could be A and B instead of male and female and  I would have had the same identical results!
Pretend to see in errors or late answers any form of gender or race preference is leftist stupid and tendentious.","Feb 19, 2019 at 3:46 PM",1, 10,
2022-05-28 19:38:27.830448,icky427,what even is this?,"it literally tells you which color kid to pick for hard or easy questions. i was just associating the + and - questions with the kid that had the word ""easy"" in front of them and x and / questions with ""hard""  because it tells you to do that. i dont understand how this is a test of racial bias. also i think its broken anyway becuase it thinks ""who is the 2nd president"" is a math question and a number divided by a number isnt a math question.","May 28, 2018 at 3:45 AM",1, 14,
2022-05-28 19:38:27.853386,ccCreator,This is not a game anyway,"When I flipped through and noticed this app, I was intrigued to see a VR title that wasn't focused on being a  game or storytelling, but instead an interactive learning tool.  When I got down to the comments, I wasn't surprised.  It was people offended by the sheer thought of anything addressing implicit bias in teaching.  As if subconscious bias isn't an issue that all people face regardless of their race or religion.  I immediately wanted to fire off a response of my own, then I realized that you can't even write a review unless you actually purchase the app.   So these folks read the quite clear description of what it was and were TRIGGERED to download it just so they could complain.  And in doing so, confirmed why implicit bias is so real and relavent in the first place.  Thank you developers for creating this tool.  I come from a family of educators and will be sharing it will all of them to help foster the discussion.  Would be great if there is a GO version of this as well, as it's something that more people need to experience and dissect.","May 26, 2018 at 11:53 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 19:38:27.877322,Plurr,Antisocial Leftist Ideology?,"This is known to be questionable science. And these sorts of anti-bias projects have a clear connection to potentially dangerous things: radical leftist ideology and identity politics. A central question becomes: is this a counterproductive project that comes from a corrupt place? Some users criticized the app in their review. Others disparaged that criticism in an unfounded way. This seems like a reflection of what we see in society: unscientific radical leftist dogma sprides like wildfire, and people will be defamed if they speak up on behalf of science or diversity of perspectrives. As usual, anononymous forums provide a more democratic atmosphere.","Oct 7, 2018 at 6:43 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:38:31.033974,dmayers340,Great App for Teaching/Other Fields,"I'm not a teacher, but I think that bringing the IATs into VR is a great idea. I think it could help train/help teachers recognize biases and try to be more thoughtful about it (and hopefully there are plans to go on to other fields also!) Hopefully some more tests will show up as well (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html) and further information about how to help reduce the biases.  Would love to see the research paper this produces to see if VR is effective at training. :)

Quick critique: the sound was a bit off and it was difficult to hear, it sounded very muffled to me. Would it be possible to remix?","May 28, 2018 at 5:55 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:38:31.048934,ronmoes80,,Blaaaah!!!! i'm getting so SICK of the teleporting mechanics. If you're in a chair you cant turn around. Free movement should be the standard!!  Instant uninstall for me.  get your *&^*$ together! then release a product,"May 27, 2018 at 9:15 PM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 19:38:31.062897,Taylor.VRBuddha,Cool introduction to an important topic,This is not a game but an educational experience around implicit bias. You get to learn about the subject and play short mini games to learn about your own bias. I love that it is a VR experience that makes you look at yourself deeper and look forward to how this idea gets developed out further.,"May 31, 2018 at 7:31 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:38:31.077857,FastLawyer,Really 3 stars,"Well, I had to give this game 5 stars with all the triggered Trumpers giving it one star and somehow claiming this is inappropriate for children. First of all, what parent lets their kid use a VR headset without supervision? Only a bad one. But secondly, and most importantly, everyone has bias. This is a learning app and is appropriate for anyone. Even if you don't believe in it, at least listen to the other side. This is not a racist test. People claiming it has been disproven surely must watch Fox news and not realize it's not a news channel, but an entertainment channel. But in all seriousness, I'm not sure VR brings anything to this app. It would have been just as good, and probably better, in a 2D screen. There's really nothing immersive here. And yeah racists are gonna racist and they can't stand the thought they are racists so they will vote 1 star even though they didn't really experience this app, unknowingly proving they have implicit bias. Good job of outing yourselves trolls.","May 27, 2018 at 8:55 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:38:31.093815,BrinkOfInfinite,Inappropriate,"I found this to be inappropriate for a game especially being rated E for everyone. I feel that this game passes off as a learning game, but in reality it turnes into a how racist are you game.","May 26, 2018 at 1:55 PM",1, 22,
2022-05-28 19:38:34.184601,Grail,Love things other than games,I find this a fascinating venture for VR to explore something other than games. I hope that others use VR for research as well. Even to investigate our own biases. Thanks for letting us see what people are doing with VR tech. Good luck!,"Jun 2, 2018 at 9:40 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:38:34.199561,jutjut1134,Why are VR games forcing into politics,Implict Bias has been disproven just as often as sources say it is factual. This is a disgusting waste of time and energy on the creators behalf and doesnt belong on a platform with youth consumers. Im sickened that Oculus considers this material appropriate for all ages.,"May 26, 2018 at 10:12 PM",1, 25,
2022-05-28 19:38:34.215518,shashkes,Great to see this use case for VR,It's very refreshing to see this kind of use case for VR. If you are a researcher of any kind you should check this out. Also the idea that we can shed some light on the dark parts in our brain is very hopeful. We all have biases and the least we can do is be aware of them.,"May 29, 2018 at 2:00 PM",5, 4,
