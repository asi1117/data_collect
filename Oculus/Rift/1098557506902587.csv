2022-05-28 17:04:11.519083,MattSamiA,LOL Funny and not funny hahaha,"Put Simply, this game is AAA. I have just finished the mamoth tutorial of learning the differnt weapons and traps. Its simply frikken awesome!. Reminds me a LOT of Asguards Wrath. Without spolining too much, uts not a top down game... You do play and use your body to fight, in saying that... It is also a top down game. I dont wanna say to much, this is not normaly my type of game, But if you like Asguards Wrath, you will love this. Plus the just random spin off twerks!! hahahahaha, CustomizTION becomes a veronika walk way show casing the latest gremlin fassion. Its by far worth more money then its selling for. GREAT GAME!!!! Thanks developers! Its the small and big things that count hahahaaa.

2022-05-28 17:04:11.563963,Biskit-,Sooo nice,"I didn't expect much from a free game, they are usually short, but I loved this one! The puzzels were very nice, it took me a little while to figure some of them out, and that is a good thing. I love the little house you spend your time in, it was so cozy. And then the search in the woods for the mask, oh my, I don't wanna spoil anything but that stuff creeps me out hahaha! Indeed the controls took some getting used to, some of the dialogue was too long, especially in the beginning when you just wanna gooooo, you know. And the wall with the tiny drawers was also quite annoying sometimes, how they pop out and sometimes fall and then I forget where it was supposed to be and the stuff goes everywhere lol, but even that was not that big of a deal. I really recommend, especially if you like puzzles like I do.",Jan 24 at 8:04 PM,5, 16,

Quite difficult at times, making me think I'd have to give up or find a walk through video but I didn't and eventually worked out what to do and how to solve the puzzles. Graphics are pretty low quality but that doesn't matter in the slightest because the game play is so good. That bit in the woods really did send a chill through me. Not had that in any other game.

However, the gameplay was too slow. There's long story modes that can't be skipped with very fun gameplay that ends too soon. The story is quite good, but is a drag when it can't be skipped and I just want to do some shooting.","May 31, 2021 at 3:38 AM",4, 12,

2022-05-28 17:04:17.862118,LakePier,Phenominal,"Absolutely great game.

pros.
.Graphics are fantastic
.Story and universe that the game takes place in are very well developed
.Spell casting system works like a charm
.Puzzles are challenging and fun
.voice acting is great
.Its free!

cons.
.Strange physics glitches
.Animations can be janky or delayed
.no option for smooth turning or movement
.Some of the earlier game mechanics are “dropped”. For example, shaking your head yes and no never appears again after it’s first use.

Notes: This game was a blast to play. The lore, the art, the music, and creativity behind this game were all things that made it great.
Really, my only complaint is game design for the reasons listed above.

Anyone with a vr headset should pick this game up, theres no excuse not to.

Ps. I would love to see the spell casting system implemented into a MMO if thats possible

Also, I would totally read a book that takes place in this games universe. Please tell your story writer to make a short novel or something.","Apr 6, 2021 at 3:37 AM",5, 41,

2022-05-28 17:04:24.207147,lordkentucky,All in all a SOLID indie VR game.,"I was browsing the Top-Free section, when I came across this game. Looked decent, and since it was free I though, ""Sure, why not try a spell casting fighting game"". Well, it was so much more then that. 
I won't make this a long review, but all in all I was very plesantly surprised. I came expecting a combat game (and it has it for sure), but I stayed for the story and puzzles. My favorite part about the game was the ""Safe Room"", and its hidden secrets (LOVED the little alchemical cubby! Wish I could have done more with it!).

I'm very impressed. Heading into the game dev stage myself, I can only say Bravo! to Stormborn Studios, and I hope I have it in me to make something like you have in the coming future. Thank you for a good experience.","Feb 3, 2020 at 5:23 AM",5, 26,
2022-05-28 17:04:24.222107,Range90S,More puzzle than combat,"I like these types of puzzle game with a hint of adventure and combat throwen in for good measure and that's what this game is.
Don't be misled as to think it is a spell combat game. This is a story driven puzzle game and it does that very well.
I especially like the collison physics and the devs of this got it extremly right. Move something with something and you get the results you prety much would expect which I have seen so many other companies fail at.
The puzzles are good enough to figure out but not taxing enough that you have to google it, which is a big thumbs up from me.
The graphics are very well done. High quality to a point and doesn't burn your graphics card out. The spells, the lighting, the over all look of the game is pleasing to the eye.
The sounds and voice acting are very well done.
The game is not epically long. I completed it within 5 hours tops as I spent a bit of time messing about.
All in all, I very much enjoyed playing this and anyone who llike these style of games will do to.
I just wonder what is next from this company.","Feb 2, 2020 at 8:49 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 17:04:24.237068,FastLawyer,More puzzle game than anything else,"This is a good game that teases greatness, but then disappoints. The best part of this game is the story. It looks like it might be an epic open-world adventure at the start or at least an epic linear story game, but it's in fact just a puzzle room interlaced with some menial activities outside of the puzzle / escape room. You learn these awesome-looking & intuitive gesture-based magical attacks, then hardly use them. I finished the game in 3+ hours ... it ends like a prologue to a great game. It leaves you wanting so much more.

2022-05-28 17:04:27.334782,jim1709,All in all pretty good,"This is not a game about fighting with spells. At least it doesnt MAINLY focus on that. Its a puzzle/adventure game. That might sound discouraging for people who were looking for a decent spell shooter but let me tell you that I was one of those people but after I bought this on a sale I was actually pretty suprised. This is what good VR games look like. A great and logical story with good spellcasting some fights and some puzzles. Its not terribly long which is why I think the price tag is a little too much but thats not for me to decide I quess. The only complaint (The one star missing) is that I was approaching the end of the game, without actually knowing it, and I decided to take a break. When I came back a huge chunk of my progress had been lost which almost made me quit the game completely but thankfully I didnt. Anyway if you do buy this dont be too hard about the length of the game to the devs. They have done something that most companies cant with way less to work with.","Jun 6, 2019 at 5:59 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 17:04:27.349742,Jofin,"Story, puzzles, and spells","I enjoyed the story, voice acting, and the good variety of puzzles which made nice use of VR.  Gesture spell casting was nice and I really liked the different spells. Combat was good but minimal so it you’re looking for more of a fast-paced action game you might be disappointed (I wasn’t). I found all 3 types of locomotion useful at different points in the game and didn’t miss smooth turning.
Some minor issues (eg climbing was a bit hit and miss) and the final fight felt very hard compared to the few easy warmups before then.  However the game allows unlimited retries without having to repeat a load of previous stuff so this wasn't too painful (except for my ego).
I took about 3 hours for my first play-through. I hope for more content in the future as I want to continue playing – it would seem a shame not to get more use out of all the foundations that have been set up.","Jun 2, 2019 at 10:52 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 17:04:27.364702,VladDRussian,Solid from the ground up,"Good engine and feels natural.  Allows for multiple movement and throwing actions are well done.  Nice to have a story and voice acting.  Can't wait for more content.  

It is short, at writing this, but so are many others.  I would of done 5 starts but items sometimes get jumpy and end up in a random place or gone.

2022-05-28 17:04:27.379662,RuneSR2,PCVR at its finest - a must have,"Didn't expect much from this game and was blown away. Using a GTX 1080 I forced super sampling 2.0 - and the game started up in solid 90 fps - just amazing. And the textures were real PCVR textures made by skilled artists with details so incredibly small everything just looked real - astonishing! So forget those awful Quest games, this is real PCVR ;-) Somehow I feel like I'm the main character in a play in a giant theater - you're instanty drawn to the story, and it doesn't feel like a game. It feels like an experience - like being there. Or maybe just Mage's Tale for adults ;-) Sound and voice acting are also fantastic, maybe not AAA fantastic, but feel genuine. One thing that could be improved is the controls - while they aren't bad, HMD-directed full locomotion would be better. And an option for smooth turning. There're no video options in the game, but super sampling can be increased by the use of Oculus Tray Tools - and high levels of super sampling make this game truly come alive.
I'm starting to feel a bad conscience for getting this game on sale. The many hours it must have taken the devs to create this gem make this game truly worth its full price. This is a must have for all Rift owners.","Jun 2, 2019 at 6:12 AM",5, 0,

I was kind of fed up with beat saber and casual games, as I get bored with them after a while, but this has a solid story, beautiful art and I love the music, it's stuck in my mind for hours after I finished playing it.

1. I love games in which you have magic powers.
2. The handling is very easy to learn but you still have to think your way through the game. Its not all hack&slay. 
3.The graphic is good, I have no performance issues and my computer is not state of the art.
4. They put much work in small details, which are not essential to the game but they make it more alive. You can see, that the people were devoted to the project.
5. The price is absolut fair. I have paid more money for early access games, which were never really finished.

As the title says, the voice acting (there is lots of voice in this game in a good way) is really good and helped make the experience much more immersive. The puzzles were fun and I liked the alchemy system they had. This game took me 4-5 hours, and for a fairly low price that seems totally reasonable to me","Dec 8, 2018 at 10:23 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 17:04:33.710728,Maj.Spoiler,"Great idea, love it, but...","So first of all: I love the spellcasting, it is exactly as i want it to be in a VR-game, perfect. The riddles and escape-room like gameplay elements are great (love the smoking pipe). The voice acting sounds pretty decent, better than i heard in some other, more expensive games. 
And now to the 'but...':
Teleportation-movement is something i despise, it is immersion breaking (i get it, people get seasick, stil...), having 'my' body run around in front of me is even worse, but that is just my opinion. At least in a game about magic it has some reasoning (astral body and all that) so okay. Anyways, glad you added smooth locomotion, but is there a way that i don't have to check it in the menu every time i switch between memories and the room? That is very tedious. 
Then i also have a weird affinity to break the game. When the Master teaches you new spells, and i try to move i usually end up either somewhere in the middle of empty nowhere, or outside the room or once in the forest with the shadow guy looking all depressed. Have to go back to main menu then, altough sometimes the book doesn't show up either so i have to close the game. Luckily the gamed saved, but mostly somewhere way before. (Example: Learning Fire arrow -> breaking game -> loading -> end up where you have to do alchemy to create butterlfies.) If you can get that fixed i'll glady change my rating to 5/5.","Nov 25, 2018 at 7:41 AM",4, 7,"Hi! Thank you for your nice review. I just uploaded a new update (1.11 version check if you have it when restarting oculus) that should fix several things with smooth locomotion. It shouldn´t restart it anymore between tutorials, cinematics and gameplay (for now you just have to turn it on when going to the beach or the forest but I am hoping to fix that too). The new update should also fix some of those problems you mention for when going into tutorials. Let me know if you get them again so I can investigate more. Also there is a fix so when doing telekinesis with your left hand you won´t be moving forward at the same time.

The narrative behind this game is gold: I enjoyed it as you would enjoy an awesome tv show you can't wait the second season for.
