2022-05-28 15:33:05.650247,FR4NCIS.QC,Awesome game but needs some improvement,"This game is great especially for billiards but above all it would really deserve an update to put it back in today's games because graphically it is a little outdated especially for the fake avatars in the bar and the control of our avatar is really not at the top and too basic because to advance by teleportation is far from being interesting.
You have to move smoothly with the joystick and not by jumping. Another disappointing thing is that there is very little or no one playing online anymore and this is probably because the game needs to update and make it more interesting for players.
Last thing ,i don't if it's me but my cap on my avatar is really too high when i look me in the mirror and for the others hats too ,i'm on oculus quest 2 and when i start the game ma position is never correct and i can't adjust it.
If there are any developers reading this post, trying to improve it or create another game in this style or just for billiards would make this game the best bar or pool game ever made on vr. Thanks !",Sep 13 at 8:55 AM,4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:33:05.666204,UKIIIRAMPAGE,Graphics and physics are amazing,"This game is great only nobody seems to play it anymore 
It's like 6 years old but for people like me that has only just tried VR this to me is new, and now with Oculus more and more people are buying VR because people don't have t mess with all the sensors, and it's cheap. Got my head set the other week and my mind exploded, my two friends who tried it had the same feeling and they too within days got themselves VR, what we need now is a new Sports bar and more and more content

Come on guys we have the ability to create and also to put ourselves in our best movies and tv shows, we should be going into the Stargate to Atlantis or exploring the Starship Enterprise taking orders from Captain Picard

Or being Robocop the original Robocop... It's time to end all this copyright crap and make this stuff happen, we have the ability and we are not here for too long before we are gone and we are missing out on so much...

Rant over just VR is so cool and we need more games like this one...","Feb 5, 2021 at 9:33 PM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 15:33:05.713079,Dreeew84,I'm only here for the pool,"Basically this is my go-to game for pool. 

To avoid back pain, I play in front of a real table and lean on it while aiming in game. This works super well and feel like I AM playing pool and making progress.

This also means that I can't physically walk around and only use in game movement mechanics, which are... suboptimal.

I think that there's a huge potential there. I'd love to get an updated standalone pool experience with updated VR movement, more environements, ability to set up matches with friends and different AI levels. I would easily pay a full price for this.","Nov 23, 2020 at 7:23 AM",4, 15,
2022-05-28 15:33:08.846698,Mad_Myk,,"Lets start with a good word for the pool...Awesome! I don't really go for anything but the pool; I can't throw the darts consistently, the air hocky is a bit 'laggy' and not quite accurate, the other games work brilliantly but I just don't play them. But pool is superb!
I CANNOT wait for a snooker addition! You guys are so close to a perfect (given the tech level we are currently at) physics engine for these ball-based games. Again; Awesome! Please do NOT give up.
Now for suggestions: I think the movement system is a little 'old-hat' now, and could do with a pro VR-user feature that enables smooth movement around the room instead of the teleport/warp system currently in place. I only say this because I am fully sensitised to VR now and don't suffer any kind of motion-sickness or other 'side-effects', and the movement is a little 'clunky' for me at my level. I'm sure this is the case for most of the long-term VR users.
Occasionally the cue-butt locks up and needs a 'shake' to allow you to continue with lining your shot up, can be annoying but isn't a real problem. I suspect it isn't the software but the communication between headset and hand-controllers.
Lastly; my friends and I regularly play pool here on VR, and it is very frustrating to not be able to actually set up a two-player game which runs exactly the same as a game with the bot players. For example; we cannot move the cue-ball after a foul shot or at the beginning when breaking off. If both players get to a black ball game, whoever drops the last spot or stripe actually ends the game and the table resets without letting us finish off with the black. It would be great if this feature could be implemented (if only to settle arguments as to who actually ""won that round"" when the black ball has not been in play.)
It says 4 stars but that's only because I couldn't actually give it 4.9.

Thank you, guys, for a great piece fo software, highly recommended.","Nov 3, 2020 at 1:08 AM",4, 5,

My biggest problem is the Skee-Ball tables are FAR too high up. No skee-ball in the real world is above the knees, but in this it's freaking waist high! Lower those tables, no one is that tall! They should be just under/around knee height. If that gets fixed, I think I'd give this another star, cause we've already heard they'll improve the multiplayer. ;)","Dec 29, 2018 at 1:40 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:33:12.012231,webnerd,Has potential but ...,"I like the variety of games on offer but it's too glitchy to play ... I left it a few months to see if it would be updated but I've not seen any obvious improvement in playability.

The 9-ball pool (looks like 8-ball got took out as an option?) is too awkward to play a decent game and it's a shame. The lock cue mechanism (with zero finetuning) means you will never be able to line that shot up you want and most of the time, my cue behaves like it's possessed making it impossible to line a shot up in the first place :( I bought this for the pool and to say I'm sorely disappointed is an understatement.

Other games ... please, please line up the dartsboard so it's actually straight (the 20 is rotated too far to the left). And even with that, the darts throwing mechanism makes this pretty hard to play.

The other mini-games are above average, I like the shuffle board in particular. Just a shame that for a game that is predominantly for pool, it just lets itself down.","Aug 27, 2018 at 12:13 AM",2, 5,

I have played in the past with an older version and it was great, unfortunately when my friends and I tried to play yesterday, the game crashed constantly, so we weren't able to play at all. Two of us had the Oculus version, one Steam version, and graphics cards ranging from the GTX 970 to the 1080 and all other specifications exceeding the recommendations. Obviously with this range of different PC's and all experiencing issues, something must have broken the game in a recent update. Please fix and let us know so we can try again.

2022-05-28 15:33:12.043149,Sebastiantho,Solid experiences with a few jaggy edges,"The game is overall a nice experienced and takes use of VR mechanics nicely. 

Pros:
+ Decent variety of games avaliable
+ Visual progression through hats, decals and similar (I find this especially important for replayability) 
+ Takes use of VR mechanics nicely
+ Intuitive controls
Cons:
- Some controls likes to annoy with you, for instance when playing a game of Pool, when locking into the position on the ball, it likes to jump a little to the right or left, making it kinda frustuating to get the precise shot 
- I don't know if others face this issue, but when I look around, I get a few stutters. Generally doesn't run amazingly, not to the point of being unplayable but it is still a hassle.
- Not a lot of players, the game is only fun as long as you can find an active lobby.","May 14, 2018 at 12:18 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 15:33:15.146848,Sharpfish,Revised review again for  latest 2018 v,"first review was 5 stars, that went to 1 with the v2 changes/issues, but now (see dev response below) to 4. I am glad to say it 'feels' better again, operationally. Though I still miss light swinging, jukebox (easy) moving to get close to my chosen table, the room is TOO dark still (just a touch - I don't want cartoon but it's quite glary in contrast still) and the neon buttons around the table really remove you from the 'real' feeling it used to have. Please consider an option to turn off the neon buttons, or at least have them fade away once your cue is out and appear again when you put your cue away! Also the 'ball in hand' tooltip stays in place even when turned off in menus, I hate tool tips for similar 'anti real' reasons. In fairness, it does feel great again and is def worth it. It's still my favourite sports VR game and the pool feels awesome! 5 if they fix those last niggles! :) Thanks for fixing what you did



(excerpt of old review)
 Game wise Pool is the obvious star here and done well enough, again is there options for UK 8 ball (Yellow and red)? I often prefer that style of game over the US 8/9 ball. Snooker table would be cool, though possibly hard to implement due to size (and needing 'rests' to reach etc). Also to the developer - PLEASE allow audio on the videos (after muting jukebox audio)  :) There's a lot of potential in this! 

Note to CharlieB below: Use 'hulk'mode to adjust yourself a little (hold both grip buttons) lets you move around in any direction (world moves around you)

Wanted to update this after some weeks of playing this game. I love it. Even with the small niggles and imperfections mentioned above it's overall an extremely well done pool sim for VR in a fun package and I can and have spend many happy hours in this game listening to my custom tunes while playing against the A.I (which does frustrate me at times on 'easy' when they pull off some incredible snookers or jump shots that no easy A.I should though I do win 9/10) GREAT!","Mar 11, 2018 at 6:14 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 15:33:15.191727,SwirlyMaple,Back to its former greatness!,"Wow! When v2 came out, I wrote a scathing review here because it had a lot of issues, and since I loved v1 so much I was really disappointed to find one of my favorite games had taken a serious nosedive. But, after the developers pushed their latest update, almost all of my complaints have been addressed, and I am really impressed (thank you devs!!!). The graphics are once again beautiful, in fact I think even better than v1, with supersampling working properly like it used to and no longer crashing when changing graphics settings. This game has a lot to love, and if you're wondering if you should get it, you should. It will very likely be one of your favorite titles in your library, especially if you like playing against your friends.

I don't want to get greedy, but if the devs are still listening, can we get back a button to return the shuffleboard pucks like it used to have? (Or is there an easy way to gather them in free play that I'm missing?) Also, the dart aim lock, can we get that back too? Lastly, the glow on the buttons added to the pool table is pretty distracting. I think the buttons would be just fine if they were more subtle/didn't have the glow above (the glow looks a lot like an unwanted, distracting 'god ray' when you're trying to line up your shot).

Thanks again to the devs for being so responsive and hearing us out, and I'm so glad to have the Sports Bar I loved back!!!","Dec 14, 2017 at 4:22 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:33:15.206687,mervunit,Mostly Empty Lobbies,"Update: shuffleboard is much improved. Having AI for it is great as well as there still isn't anyone in USA playing this. A few in the European lobbies which was fine. They mostly spoke English. Mostly people were playing air hockey, some pool. Some changes were made in dart throwing it seems. Probably needs some ironing out still. New game mode was something. Would have rather seen like a card table room or something. I could see something like that pulling in another auidence to fill some lobbies. Everyone loves bar Euchre.
Absolutely no one playing this. Game is great and the games in the game work pretty well, aside from picking up chess peices and grabbing shuffleboard pucks correctly. Would be so much better if there was a larger user base, but if no one is here I'm not going to play it, and if I'm not going to play it the next guy won't and so on and so forth.","Dec 18, 2017 at 4:26 AM",4, 0,

A couple suggestions -- would love to have the ability to summon a remote from the menu; also, bowling would be amazing, but if full-size bowling is out of the question, what about shuffleboard bowling? Shuffleboard is already there, and bowling on it is a lot of fun but a pain in the neck to set up in real life, so virtual shuffle bowling would be super fun!!","Dec 14, 2017 at 12:42 AM",5, 0,

Revising my score back up a couple stars. The strange thing is that performance has gone down drastically versus pre-2.0 version.

2022-05-28 15:33:18.327341,DingBatDave,Literally just bought this...,"Just bought it haven't even fired it up yet, but having read the recent reviews i'm worried... i had been told this was one of the best VR games out there, but it seems a recent update has changed that... So, later when i have time i will give it a shot and if it dissapoints and has the problems people are reporting, then an immediate refund will be happening. Very dissapointed tho' i was really looking forawrd to this one. fingers crossed.

UPDATE: 
I didn't refund. the game works well for me, however many of the things people reported are quite annoying. the tool tips pop up in you line of sight blocking your view of a shot in pool and it's a stupid thing to do.

There's no way they intended it to be like this im sure. Hope so anyway as the new features look good, just what i wanted.


Really good game, the pool is ultra realistic and good that you can load your own playlist and play your own music through the jukebox, or watch your own MP4 Movies on the TV screens around the bar. 
My only small problem with it (and it is small) is the fact that if theres more than 2 of us in the room, we cant invite our other mates to play a proper game of pool with us, with rules and ball selection, opponents turn etc, we can only play in a hangout session where its an open table. Its not a game breaker though and hopefully when we can get our hands on V2.0 it will be implemented.","Dec 2, 2017 at 4:51 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:33:24.632476,74Loki,Has a lot of potential,"Overall this is really good from a pool standpoint. The physics feel pretty good but could use some improvements. For instance when you aim at the cue ball it snaps to the center. You can move it down at an angle somewhat but I haven't figured a way to aim under the cue ball for jump shots, jump draws, etc. Also I haven't found a good way to put good spin on the cue ball. Also you can kind of cheat by standing in the middle of the table rather then having to streatch for them. I spend most of my time playing the AI though because of lack of players which is a shame. It's fun when you do have at least a few people around throwing bottles, chairs or other funny stuff.
The throwing mechanics could definately use some work though. The darts just feel way to awkward and unnatural. The same with the skee ball, it just feels wierd trying to get any steam behind anything thrown.
The air hockey is another bright spot if you have people to play with. The only unfortunate thing with it is that regardless of who is playing anyone can come and grab the paddles which makes it easy for someone to troll it.
Overall though I think it's a good game that, with a little more development, could become a real gem.","Sep 11, 2017 at 6:47 AM",4, 0,

There are some stunning visuals and the pool physics are quite impressive (but you get a bad-back playing because you've not got a real table to physically lean on!).  This game has potential but it has one huge problem:  No players!  I've probably been in-game for about 2 hours in total, during which time I found only one person, once, to play pool against.  Where is the community?  There are some nice mini-games but with nobody to play against, it's a bit pointless.  UPDATE - March 2017:  Last night I tried the app again for the first time since I bought it in Dec/Jan.  There was still nobody to play against.  All lobbys were 'empty'.  UPDATE - June 2017:  I played this game multiplayer with a friend who had purchased it.  Although the mini-games are good and some of the visuals do look fantastic, we found that we were completely bored of the app after 20 minutes.  I COULD see this app take-off in the future as it's got potential, but there's something missing here; and it's more than just a thriving community.

so i thought since this pro player falls down it means it must b super realistic!and IT IS!!!
plays fantasic but they need 2 work on the spin on the cue ball..works good when it hits the other balls,everything is spot on but when u give for example right spin on the cue ball and it hits other balls and then the edge of the table the spin doesnt transalate as it should b,in this case it doesnt jump of the edge to the right side which it should...if they fix that its PERFECT!!!!

Visually, SportsBar VR is very nice, presuming you have the hardware to push the Ultra settings, with 2.0 SSAA. I'm an avid pool player, so I was hoping the pool tables would play realistically, and they do, but it feels a bit clumsy. If you set the ingame height system up to utilise the actual height of a desk/table to lean your bridge hand on, the pool in SportsBar VR can feel almost real. You'll need to master the 'Hulk' movement system to make using a real life support feasible - if you suffer with motion sickness, the 'Hulk' system may make you feel queasy - and control system 1 is better for cue tip positioning realism. The forced childlike back hand cue grip, and often awkward feel, impact the game negatively. PLEASE DEVS, ALLOW ME TO ADJUST HAND POSITIONING ON THE CUE. Another big issue for me is the poor haptic feedback. This mainly applies to the air hockey game. Having your hand floating around slightly as it grips the pusher doesn't help with directing the puck with any real accuracy, but almost zero sense of hitting the thing makes it completely lifeless, and therefore, a bit pointless. Talking of pointless, let's talk about the darts: the tracking is OK, but the board registration is abysmal. I'm an average darts player in real life (I hit the odd 180 now and then), so when I throw a dart into the '20' (some 10-20mm inside the wire) I don't expect to see a registered '5' scored! Double tops are often registered even when my arrow is almost a full inch above the wire; trebles might reward you with a single...you get the idea...it's useless. The shove ha'penny (well, that's what it's been called for donkeys years in the UK) and rampball games are mediocre - if you want to see both games done properly, try The Pierhead Arcade. With some effort, the pool can be good, the rest is eye candy.","Feb 24, 2017 at 3:57 AM",2, 0,"I'm sorry you're having a hard time connecting.

My biggest complaint is the way it feels to interact with a lot, but not all, items in the bar. The way items ""snap"" into your hand sometimes forced me to place them down in ackward and unnatural positions. If I pick up a chess piece from the top, it shouldn't snap to me holding it by the side. I'm them forced to put the chess piece back down on the board like it was a bottle of beer. I have a similar complaint with shuffle board. Also the pointer line is angled in an unnatural way when coming out of the hand. This needs a bit of polish.

The controls could be a lot less complex, and playing pool could be a lot less abstract.  Your pool cue auto locks onto the center of the ball, and then you have to hold other buttons to adjust its position and orientation.  That means you can't actually place the cue where you want it physically, you have to go through a three step process every time.  Just let me move my hard wherever I please, and hold the trigger to go elbows down and stabilize my forward hand, maybe a partial trigger pull to slow down my hand motions, not snap both hands in a perfect straight shot position.
