2022-05-28 19:13:54.984643,YGBHawk,Terrible hit registration,"If you've played beat saber this is not going to be for you. This was easy, very easy. The only thing that makes it harder is the notes blocking your view on the harder levels. The harder levels are less work too, as you have to time to actaully punch, so you end up just letting the notes hit your hands with your arms out stretched. 

The second thing you notice after being able to do a few songs on expert+ on BeatSaber is that the hit registration on this game is a flop, dont get me wrong you can hit 98% of the note without any issue. However every now and then dispite moving to hit a note it will give a miss even if you made the hit on screen. 

The saber mode is aweful, really really bad. I found the punching one to be the best mode. All the others are just there to give the game more appeal or so it felt.  
I dunno, personally I cant recommend it, not to say some people wont enjoy it I guess, but i was spoiled by beat saber before playing this game.",Aug 2 at 6:48 AM,2, 1,

2022-05-28 19:13:55.014563,Alicia_Wonderland,Really impressed!,"I can’t remember if I got this on sale or it was just a really good price but I wasn’t expecting much, but I’m so impressed! This is as good, if not better than other workout rhythm games that are much more well-known. I’m using this with the link on my Quest2 and really hope this gets ported over to the Quest with crossover buy! I think this would be a huge success on the Quest and be able to compete with Audio Trip (I think this is BETTER) and Synth Rider and this is so much more fun than Supernatural at a fraction of the price! I haven’t tried FitXR yet but this seems similar.

There are many things to customize (I now have all the same color controllers in all my rhythm apps to make it easier.) You can punch or use swords or other weapons but I definitely like punching the best. (I imagine punching Trump for the best workout lol.) I haven’t figured out how to add custom songs yet but there seems to be spot for them. Are there any instructions how to add them?

The only negatives I have is that some songs are MUCH harder than others on the same level of difficulty and some songs are ridiculously easy, it feels odd that they are both listed as as the same level of difficulty. Also sometimes the “sun” coming up behind the ship gets too bright and makes it harder to see the targets. And the calorie counting is way off, it says I’m burning calories when I’m just standing there waiting for the targets to start. But so happy I got this! I know I will be spending a lot of time playing it.","Nov 10, 2020 at 2:59 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 19:13:55.045480,ThaDip,Please make it for the Quest!,"I absolutely love it. 
(few things: I sometimes don't see the orbs because other ones are in the way.
And I hate the voice when I miss a hit. But the rest is awesome!)
But I hate not having the freedom of being cordless.
I am so used to playing on the Quest so I really hope you will make it for the Quest too.
Again love it!","Jul 3, 2020 at 2:00 AM",5, 4,"Thank you for your kind words! In fact we already have Quest version, it is available on SideQuest here: https://sidequestvr.com/app/385
(Feel free to contact us at info@songbeater.com with your Rift purchase info and we will provide you with Quest version for free, we are believers in cross-buy :))"

2022-05-28 19:13:58.189072,sbenrap,Delivers for me what Synth Riders didn't,"So after 'not clicking' with Synth Riders I was looking for some other rythm game to play (other than Beat Saber of course) and stumbled upon this little gem.
It took one play on Normal difficulty to get hooked.

Feel like a kicka** boxer? Check
Punch the orbs according to the beat and show'em who's boss? Check
Customised colors for BS addicts? Check
Roughly 40 tracks of various genres? Check
Custom Songs? Check
Decent price tag? Check
Many playstyles and modes? Check
Sweat like a pig? Check
Arms in pain for days after playing...? Well err.. maybe I should have rested some more - Check.
Oh - FUN?! Check!

For the life of me I don't understand how this game isn't more popular, it was so much fun finding the flow with the beat and punching through the orbs is extremely satisfying.
I'm guessing the graphics won't blow you away - but the game is FUN and this is what matters. 
So if you are on the lookout for good workout games - this is the one you want to try!","Nov 11, 2019 at 5:59 AM",5, 6,

this game is worth a buy!!!  I hope the devs are reading this cause they did a great job!!!","Oct 15, 2019 at 11:21 AM",5, 4,
