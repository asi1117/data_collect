2022-05-28 19:25:00.741980,GameHauntings,It scared the crap out of me,"Ok for a free game it's awesome. You can feel the Vr Experience.. It scared me you can see my reactions in the video :

2022-05-28 19:25:00.755943,Satconcook,"Good concept, bad implementation","I was really hoping for a quick short jump scare type experience, but this was more laughable than scary. It does have some of a creepy vibe to it, but really feels like someones first attempt at a VR game for their class project. The trailer pretty much shows you the entire game without the boring moments in between listening to the obvious audio loops waiting for the next thing to happen. I’m glad it was free because I would have been upset even wasting $0.99 on this.","May 29, 2019 at 11:43 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:25:03.858645,Squii123,Doesn't Even Play,I go to load it up and it just closes. Doesn't say it won't work or anything. It just doesn't come up at all.,"Jun 1, 2018 at 3:34 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:25:03.873604,FastLawyer,Cheap thrills,"So I wasn't even sure how to start the experience.  But then I just started staring at the the symbols and the experience started.  This is a purely cinematic experience.  You can look at your avatar in the mirror.  Things happen all around you.  It's very campy and very B movie/ B game?  Then this woman comes up to you and does something very .... special?  Well, I won't spoil it for you but will you finish is the question.","Mar 2, 2018 at 12:56 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 19:25:03.888564,nightcat.mau,Wonderfully Strange,"If you like current Japanese horror you will love this. *spoilers* It refrences everything from games with dolls, ancestral spirits, Kagome and Ringu. Really well done, though it is heavily sight driven, so if you don't look in the right place the narrative stalls. Trust me, I spent five minutes, twice, after the first event, wondering why nothing else happened and doing the YMCA dance in the mirror. But follow the flying dall's flight path to stare at the photo. If you stall try looking at or looking away from things. You can watch the whole thing in the preview if you get stuck, and yes, the lady's placement is really unfortunate.","Mar 9, 2018 at 4:33 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:25:03.903524,MrGamingplan,Was it supposed to be scary?,"Theres a huge build up to what I expected to be a good jumpscare, but got left with a ragdoll female character making some sort of muffled moaning sound, just flailing around infront of me, so glad this was free and not a paid game, otherwise I'd be getting my money back.","Jul 15, 2018 at 5:06 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:25:03.917487,Caspersight,Short But Sweet,"Guys this is a free game! and for that it has to be ok right? Well yes this game freaked me right out its very short, about 2:00 mintues but it is well worth the download and for you friends to give it a try.
