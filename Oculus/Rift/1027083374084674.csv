2022-05-28 18:55:17.199319,SloshedFox,Forgot game,"If your looking to play through the same levels and fight the same enemies over and over buy it, the enemies are just health sponges and the enemies dont change at all other than adding armor. The levels allowed for some floating rocks to just phase through the map and some spots would catch you so you couldnt move for a second or arrows mid air. My last complaint was just archery, if you pulled back a little too far the bow would sling up so your just shooting an arrow into the sky. Was hoping to see better.","May 27, 2021 at 7:18 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 18:55:17.258161,taquitobuddy,Fun mindless hacknslash,"Pros:
Good variety of weapon types
Decent graphics, voice acting, and VR implementation
Decent variety of enemy types
Coop is crossplatform and works well

Cons:
Gets repetitive after a few hours, not much real content
Combat isn't satisfying and is very basic
Some terrain issues


This game is fun for a few hours with a friend, but lacks any real depth to make it a game that you'd keep coming back to.  The combat is functional, but extremely basic (just flailing around for melee, no physics or anything like that).  And while there are ~40 stages, they are all really the same.  You pick a ""stage"" and it just generates a random map with one of maybe 4 objectives.   Tough call between 2 or 3 stars, gave it 3 stars for having crossplatform coop play and a low price.","Jun 29, 2019 at 6:43 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:55:20.397764,BainPD,Great Co-op Game!,"IMHO - Most VR games are tactile gimmicks, unfinished messes, or provide half-baked story lines, this game is all around well done!

Combat: 5/5 The combat is what you should expect from a medieval-style game.  Shields work well and the magic weapons are a total blast to use!

Story:  3/5 The story is alright, I think the effort into the story matches the pace of the game.  It gives you a reason to why you're there and sets the mood.

Mechanics: 4/5 Game mechanics are overall nice, stometimes getting stuck is a thing but it's relatively easy to get out of being stuck.  The game is basically a 3D version of a 2D side scrolling game which makes it nostalgic and refreshing.

Weapons:  5/5 Awesome variety and well balanced!

Online: 5/5  Everyone, minus a player or two, I have played with is absolutely awesome, and I've probably played with about 25 online players total.

Definitely a must have VR game!!!","May 20, 2019 at 1:49 AM",4, 10,

2022-05-28 18:55:20.427684,FastLawyer,"Really good, arcade fun crawler","So this is a coop focused dungeon (open-air really) crawler. Playing solo though is just as fun. Keep in mind, it's mostly just mindless fun. Go to this open air dungeon and kill everything, get loot & upgrades, rinse & repeat. There's really no story. Quests are pretty similar. Dungeons start looking the same. But there's lots of weapons to try and different enemies to kill. Better with friends.","Oct 10, 2018 at 12:52 PM",4, 0,

The melee feels very weightless and doesn't really require any skill.  I can't find anyone online to play with though, there's never any games going.   Some of the missions seem too difficult for solo players.","Oct 2, 2018 at 8:50 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:55:20.457604,vovik86,A lot of fun with a few issues,"As of right now, the game is a lot of fun but very short. Once you finish all the missions and unlock all the weapons (which can be done in just a few hours), you can either repeat them or play survival mode where you fight wave after wave of orcs. I wish there was a little more variety. Also there seems to be an issue where the game starts to glitch (lag, orcs disappear...) after playing it for 1-2 hours straight. Easily fixed by restarting the game but still slightly annoying.","Sep 25, 2018 at 9:47 PM",4, 5,

For the fact that its actually fun to play now and the amount of care shown by those making this game that i'd recommend it today!

Swinging wildly with no real feel for what you are doing.

2022-05-28 18:55:23.623138,supatrupa,Just an OK game,"I played this one coop with a friend and it left me wishing for better mechanics. I found myself just swinging my sword around wildly, blocking with the shield seemed random/pointless. The world is beautiful, but feels static and dead. The enemy AI is pretty terrible - the update loop is so slow that frequently they walk to where you were standing 30 seconds ago, kinda hilarious but also sad. Having said that, it's not that expensive and it's kinda fun to shoot a bow at mindless mobs and hack them to bits.","Feb 8, 2018 at 12:19 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 18:55:26.729828,codeblink,Impressive. Short. Needs a game studio.,"It's a great game but very limited in content. Multiplayer and the random objectives with random maps help replayability, but the majority of players are people who have less than 10 hours.
It's come a long way in a year from a single developer but it's still very 'alpha' feeling.
Looking forward to trying it out again in a year.","Dec 3, 2017 at 8:00 AM",3, 1,

But im have seen various ""Game Server: Peer Created"" now, which im allready tired of it, which is why im hate those allways drm crappy.

2022-05-28 18:55:26.759748,HKg36,A must have,"I would recommend the game without hesitation, cooperative is frankly funny. As suggestions for improvement would add improvements in melee combat.
When you are in front of an orc, he ends up being too close to the player and as they have very short weapons the exchange of strokes and shield stops becomes uncomfortable, and on the other hand, as they are low it is like fighting with a child, me I have to be half crouched because most of his punches go up to my hip and this is also frankly uncomfortable, also they can pass throw me, so i can´t play in the ""tank"" rol. Making them a little higher, giving them longer weapons, (a good orc combat ax would be very good) and making the collision with the player was a little more distant would be a very good melee. To add something more about it, animations could be improved when melee weapons collide, right now it is sometimes confusing.

And some general points, orcs with axes physically cross the archers when there is little space for them to approach, is rare and sometimes get stuck on the stairs. The crows fly against the branches and also get stuck, fun to see, but also rare.

It's all for now, I will continue to play and enjoy the game.
Keep working hard, you're doing great!","Sep 29, 2017 at 10:29 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:55:26.775705,McFear,Locomotion ruined it for me,"I was excited to try this especially since it was a co-op game and I have most fun when playing WITH my family BUT, the movement mechanics in the game have a long way to go in order to make this game playable for me. I wanted the free movement rather than teleporting but the game locks you into a single direction once you start moving and your turns are in chunky 90 degree increments. Also it puts you into tunnel vision when you start moving forward. All of this makes the combat clunky and unfun. I tried hard to like this game but I couldn't even force myself to finish the first level because the movement mechanics ruined it for me.","Oct 26, 2017 at 11:16 PM",2, 1,"Hey McFear. Every single thing you mentioned can be set in the settings. Check it out, the game has every movement option possible."
2022-05-28 18:55:26.790665,The Robinsons,Definately one to watch!,"This isn't a complete finished game and it really does have quite a few issues but it also has absolutely huge potential. Is it worth the money in it's current state? That's a definate YES. The procedural terrain keeps it fresh and keeps me playing again and again. I'm really looking forward to seeing this develop into an amazing title! I hope the dev keeps up the good work and I have no regrets investing in this game. I encourage you to do so also. :)


UPDATE: Most of the issues are fixed and there are regular updates from the developers. It just keeps on getting better! A superb game for the fantasy Orc slayers out there. Addition of Co-op play adds an extra dimension plus lots of cool new spells hidden in treasure chests. This could end up being the WoW for VR.","Sep 14, 2017 at 10:04 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:55:29.914311,Cyda,A gem of a game,"A great bow and sword game for VR. Fun and frantic gameplay, good art design and a very attentive developer. I love the progression in the game and it's been great fun unlocking each of the weapons and trying to find the ones I don't have.

The 'Twin Sticks' locomotion and the way the 'Teleport' locomotion in implemented in this game are an example of how VR locomotion should be done. If only every developer would add these same locomotion options, we'd have the options to suit everyone and all games would be open to all VR users regardless of their sensor setup. Of all the VR games I own the locomotion options in this are up there with the best of them.


If you enjoy the longbow part of The Lab then you'll love this game, the bow handling is really well done and satisfying, and the crossbows are also really fun. It's one I keep coming back to and it's been getting better with each update. 
Totally recommended from me.","Jul 21, 2017 at 12:47 AM",4, 2,

The concept with buying weapons is interesting, but we didn't want to lock out all 13 weapons (and most of the fun!) behind a grind system.

It's already in a state where it's worth more than the purchase price, and it also keeps getting pretty frequent updates.

In this game you take on quests in different ""arenas"". There is a great variety of different enemies, each which have its own abilities.  And there is a great progression system in this game, where you get new weapons as you complete different quests.

Also, this game has a lot of different options for locomotion, which other developers could really learn from. It does not matter, if you like teleporting or full locomotion or even a combination of both. This game has it.

The developer updates the game very often and listens to the fans of the game. At this price, it is a steal. Get it!","Feb 24, 2017 at 3:20 AM",5, 5,

Also, I could not find a way to hold both the bow and sword with my right hand which I prefer.

Procedural levels that are different every time you play provide a trove of content to beat. Each weapon is a different playstyle in disguise you can mix&match to your liking. Enemies are very interesting to fight, each packing a few special abilities, even though they sometimes use it in a dumb way or get stuck in a tight corridor. I played this game on steam first (devs do give out keys if you bought the game on one of the platforms) - and I have to say it plays even better on oculus home.

It sports very ituitive motion options, with 4 modes of teleportation, walk and everything in between. Have to yet see a game that does this better.

There are some quirks with enemy AI making stupid decision like turning away from you and walking off a cliff, but I guess that's to be expected from a thick skulled orc. 

The weapons are fun to explore and try out. Every one is new way of playing the game, from a hunter sharpshooter to dual wielding barbarian, you can pretty much be whoever you want.
