Some levels are designed which required with ‘a couple of strategies’ in order to finish. Unfortunately, there are no options for the rewarding bounty in buying into much advance guns or upgrading of guns. Multi players features could be implemented to enhance more fun. There’s still a final level which is not being design and added into the game. Hope to see this could all be updated in near future. Overall, it’s a 8/10. However, it could be further enhanced to become a fantastic cowboy shoot up game with score of 10/10! Recommended it to all families~",Jul 1 at 12:22 PM,4, 1,

Its very hard and most of the time impossible to dodge bullets. Enemies spawn as you move ahead and sometimes they spawn behind you. Shooting is also not as satisfying as I initially thought it would be. Also theres the same voice saying ""yeah headshot"" every time just annoying.","Feb 26, 2021 at 9:20 PM",1, 14,
