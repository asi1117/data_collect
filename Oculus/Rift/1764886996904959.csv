2022-05-28 18:40:14.764010,platespinningdog,Doesn't support left-handed mode,"I am not really a robot... so I can't switch my dominant hand. 

Is there a way to switch the controls? The dominant hand and the locomotion controls are exactly the opposite of what I am used to: I need the sword in my left hand, and move and turn should be mirrored. I cannot play the game like this, so 1 star. But maybe I missed something. There really really should be a configurable option for this!! 1 in 10 people is left-handed!

If you can help me to fix this, I will redo the review, but I think it is fair to warn other lefties here. What I saw so far looks interesting!

[Response to developer]
Thanks for your response to my review, I hadn't really expected it anymore after nearly two months... I'm sorry you didn't take my review too well, but my warning to my fellow lefties stands: this game is unplayable for left-handed gamers. Putting this review here is not about taking you hostage, but warning my fellow left-handed players for whom it is not worth spending a penny on this game, and so it is the right place for it. My tip for avoiding negative customer experiences: expand your beta test. As a former business manager I can say from experience that even small teams can deliver successful products with excellent quality if they get their processes right.","Feb 19, 2021 at 12:50 PM",1, 0,"Hi there platespinningdog,

We apologize for the negative experience caused to you by not having a 'left handed' mode. We're a REALLY small team (one guy doing art/programming, 2 guys helping out with other stuff) and found setting up left handed mode"" to be both a difficult task and smaller priority, as our left-handed beta testers felt this wasn't an issue, but we see your point and are going to try to address this going forward.

That said, trying to hold small developers hostage with negative reviews that could potentially negatively impact their sales and livelihood is not a productive means of communication. Consider contacting us through our website, social media, Discord, etc. We love engaging with our community and listen to all feedback and concerns!"
2022-05-28 18:40:14.779967,glassem,Awesome Intense Hack N Slash,"Really nice game, especially after Arena was introduced. I'm a big fan of simple competitive games and luckily made it onto the Top 10 on the leaderboards- good luck beating my score lolol
Arena aside, the game itself has a brain-blast story that really makes you think. The physics based combat is awesome and gives a real sense of attack and defense with a sword. The game also has a sweet futuristic setting unlike any you'll see in other games!","Jun 13, 2020 at 11:05 AM",5, 5,"Thanks so much for your review. We've worked hard on crafting a complete experience for you, and we're glad you're enjoying. Great score!"
2022-05-28 18:40:14.793930,plotking,Great Game,"The game has it all. Sword combat action, a cool story line, and some puzzles to sovle too. All with a soundtrack that keeps you going. These alone make it worth the cost. You will get hours of time out of this one. Being able to play seated is an added plus for me.","Jun 15, 2020 at 3:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:40:14.808890,Aggronian,Great Experience,"I really enjoyed Orion 13 so far. The game play is fun and intense throughout the entire game and I never felt myself getting bored. The combat is smooth and plays very well, and its not too easy but not too hard that newcomers would have a hard time getting into it.
The story is fantastic too which is not typical of most of the vr games that I've played. The music is incredible and makes the game feel very exciting and is very fitting for the hectic fighting and fits well with the techno graphics.","Jun 24, 2020 at 1:35 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:40:14.824847,JoliusCaesar,Quest+Link Delivers Flawless Performance,"I listened to an NPR interview with Metro VR Studios a couple months back and had to try the game for myself. I was relieved to find that it works seamlessly on the Oculus Quest when using the Link cable. For those starting out, I highly recommend starting in the Battle Arena before progressing to the campaign. The game may be hack and slash, but this isn't your typical button-masher. Coordination and precision are they keys to progressing far in both the Arena and campaign as you learn to simultaneously use your skills and swordsmanship to defeat incrememtnally more difficult opponents. This game cuts no corners.","Jun 18, 2020 at 6:53 AM",5, 1,"Hi JoliusCaesar, thank you so much for your review and tips. We're really glad you liked the NPR article, it was a lot of fun for us to introduce them to VR!"
2022-05-28 18:40:17.976418,smantie,Intense sword combat with great setting,"An intense hack & slash swordfighting experience with a great soundtrack, great environments, and story that I got many hours of playtime from. The arena allows for endless and challenging waves of enemies with an online leaderboard to test your skill against others. Lots of fun, good soundtrack.","Jun 17, 2020 at 10:02 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:40:17.991378,Galahazz,Love this game!,Love this game! I got to try this out at PAX East and knew I wanted to buy it. Swordplay is awesome. Great action. Totally entertaining and a fun way to escape from reality. Highly recommend!,"Jun 16, 2020 at 7:35 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:40:18.006338,JaRail,Intense retro-vr combat,"Everything about this game embraces a kind of retro-future VR arcade aesthetic. That includes music, environments, robots, dialog, etc. It works well. High framerates with lots of flashy eye candy. As for gameplay, the combat mechanics are fast and fluid. High damage with lots of targets and movement. This would be a hard game for VR newbies but more experienced players will appreciate the speed/intensity.","Jun 21, 2020 at 8:21 AM",4, 2,
