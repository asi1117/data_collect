2022-05-28 20:31:41.764502,nickholl,Top game - great value (1complaint),"Cant really fault this game on the whole - great value for money, lots of great gameplay, cross buy, multiplarer - loads of modes...
there's just ONE issue thats become apparent now ive reached higher levels and am pressing the controller buttons a bit harder..  i frequently (accidentaly) press the analogue stick which then switches gameplay into cockpit mode. This is very disorinatating and totally ruins a race. Hopefully they'll make this option toggleable soon though.","Oct 26, 2020 at 3:37 AM",5, 4,

Is multiplayer matchmaking even a thing in this game?","Dec 3, 2020 at 6:23 PM",3, 0,Hi Ovi_S in the latest build you will find an Online Matchmaking button at the bottom of the screen in the garage. Pressing this will find other players to play and you can still race while you are waiting. Hope this helps :)
2022-05-28 20:31:41.797414,PhotoDeej,BlazeRush 2.0 <3,"Excellent, unique design and art, beautiful tracks, fun AI!
The UI is a pleasure to use, with wonderful interactivity and fun variety!

This game immediately gave me nostalgia for BlazeRush in the best ways! Arcade-races filled with knuckle-clenching, enjoyable chaos. I have only played an hour or so of Classic mode, but it's absolutely a blast with excellent track design. Bumper Ball is a hoot, and really provides a virtual analog to Rocket Leebs. ;)

I can't wait to jump back in tomorrow, and give the gun mode a shot!

The fact that it's crossbuy makes it a no brainer for cart/RC racer lovers.","May 15, 2020 at 1:53 PM",5, 17,Hi PhotoDeej - really appreciate the positive feedback - thank you!
2022-05-28 20:31:41.813372,Psycojojo,fantastico!,"I love, love, love this game! Its so much better than mario kart but on the same lines. Once you have figured out which view mode is best for you then its just perfect! I can`t stop playing and would recomend to everyone of all ages. The graphics are amazing the game play is on point! well done devs! Unique is the only word for it! Im hooked! :)","Jun 16, 2020 at 6:39 AM",5, 4,"Fantastic to hear, Psycojojo! Thanks so much :)"
2022-05-28 20:31:44.923161,Djneo134,We need a jump button!,"Hi devs, I would like to congratulate you for this game. It's really funny to play and pleasant to watch and listen. I have just two requests to adress you. 1st one is that all the tracks are really too small. They're good looking and cool but really too shorts. Can you create some variations with much longer length and curves? The second request is I think a really must have: we need a button to make our car jump. It'ld be awesome to jump in the giant ball mode. With a jump button we can really create strategies to score goals and to steal the ball from our opponents. The jump button would also be cool in all the race tracks, like in Mario Kart for exemple. So please, please... Add this function in a future update. All the players would be very happy I promiss. Thanks again for your work and this game :)","May 18, 2020 at 10:55 PM",4, 11,"Hi Djneo134 - thanks for the feedback :) Some tracks are longer than others to be sure, but we wanted to keep things small for this game in particular being ""Mini"" Motor Racing and all ;) 

As for a jump in Bumper Ball, it's always been a consideration and we will continue to evaluate as more people join in the fun. Thanks again! :)"
2022-05-28 20:31:44.939118,Zeum,Off Road + R.C. Pro-AM Reboot,"First off I can tell the developers are gamers, they thought of all those little details that make you coming back for more. The Devs put a lot of work into the game and didn't rush something out to make a buck. They also jam packed a lot of great gameplay in one $25 title, there are mini games, racing, racing with weapons, career mode with plenty of unlockables, and online play.

I loved both Off Road and R.C. Pro-Am, this title is a wonderful reboot to 2 great video games of my 80's childhood. Controlling the car from a top down view is a lot of fun. If you've played Moss before the look and feel of this game is similar.  If you enjoy racing titles at all you must pick this up.","May 18, 2020 at 8:27 PM",5, 10,"Thanks, Zeum! 80's 4 life my friend! Super Off Road was a major inspiration for the game and we're humbled that some of that timeless classic can be seen shining through. Thanks for the awesome review :)"
2022-05-28 20:31:44.954078,rafaelsobral3,Simple and very well done!,Beaultifull game with many view options. You can experience it in many ways in simple beautifull scenario.,"Jul 11, 2020 at 7:18 AM",5, 2,"Much appreciated, rafaelsobral3."
2022-05-28 20:31:44.969038,Fenrir420,This is really fun actually,"The whole using the car with an RC remote is cool and the option to also drive behind the wheel is nice. There is a alot of tracks and reason to progress, I do not think 25 bucks is to much to ask for. I am a fan of RC cars also, so it suits something different I wanted from VR. Most importantly, it has multiplayer. The rocket league like game is not bad either, since Rocket League never jumped on VR, someone else did. I blame whoever decided not to do rocket league VR or never got brought up.","May 15, 2020 at 7:03 AM",5, 11,"Thanks, Tuxedo-Charlie! :)"
2022-05-28 20:31:44.985993,GameScrub,Nostalgia Attack to the max!,"This game is a lot of fun!  I feel like I'm playing with toy cars like when I was a kid.  Yeah it's not Moss graphically but the artwork is solid and cute, the gameplay loop is really fun, the menu is very interactive.

I play each track 3 times...
1. First person view - Really fast
2. Third person view - Mario Kart style
3. God View - Play it like Pro Am RC game

It needs more tracks (instead of a variation of the same track) and career leaderboards but it's a solid game that I just keep coming back to over and over.

Haven't tested multiplayer and other modes yet, but I really like this product so far.","May 20, 2020 at 8:29 AM",4, 3,Hi GameScrub - many thanks for the review! We've put a lot of time into the online modes and think you'll find a lot of cool new ways to enjoy the game there :) Thanks again!
2022-05-28 20:31:48.093275,fandomgames,What a fantastic game,"Everything about this game is great. The racing is fun, there are many different vehicles, viewing angles, maps, upgrades and so much more. The bumper ball (rocket league) mode is super fun and with more people getting the game multiplayer is a blast especially with all the upgrade choices. 

The steering is top notch. You can use a rc controller or go first person in the car and use the wheel. You can also grab the wheel and go to a top of the car view freehanding the wheel,  being able to move it anywhere and rotate it to control the car.

Overall this game is well worth the money and easily one of the best native vr racing games out there (and yes I know this started as a flat screen game)","May 17, 2020 at 2:53 AM",5, 3,"Hi fandomgames - appreciate that, thank you!"
2022-05-28 20:31:48.108235,Davestand,The Best,"This is 100% the best car game in VR, would have been awesome if you could onlinew matchmake","Jul 20, 2020 at 10:56 PM",5, 1,"Hi Davestand, In the latest build you will find an Online Matchmaking button at the bottom of the screen in the garage. Pressing this will find other players to play and you can still race while you are waiting (you can also invite Oculus friends or create a private room with a code in the latest update)  ;)"
2022-05-28 20:31:48.124192,Low_Battery,Great game with a few flaws,"Super fun arcade/kart racer. 

Excellent car physics — easy to learn drifting and rewarding to master. 

Multiplayer is the killer app. So much fun to race with friends. 

Room for improvement:
Balancing the race mechanics — the pack leader has a HUGE advantage. 

Why give more turbos and cash to the pack leader? It only helps them hold and extend their lead. Turbos are badly needed when trailing but are nearly impossible to acquire unless you’re in first place. 

Why give land mines to the leader? Again this only helps the leader maintain and extend their lead. 

Competitor car AI is very aggressive. If you get stuck behind with the pack, your times will be kneecapped due to battling it out. The leader is free to navigate the track unfettered. 

Why no “turbo start” feature for timing the accelerator pedal at the start of the race? This adds a dimension of skill to the start. 

Why no shortcuts on the tracks?","May 26, 2020 at 1:04 AM",4, 2,"Hey Low_Battery - thanks for the feedback! We did actually spend a lot of time on balance, especially in Type-X where (believe it or not) we do weight the pickups; i.e. first place is HIGHLY likely to roll a wrench, and the back of the pack is far more likely to score a boost pack or tornado to help level the field. Nitros can also spawn anywhere, and don't just appear out in front, although 1st place has a statistical advantage early on by virtue of the pack usually being tight towards the start of the race. We'll continue to monitor these as more people join in on the fun :) We'll take those other suggestions into consideration moving forward also. Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 20:31:48.140150,GameJunky513,Awesome Game!!,"EDIT: Tonight the MP worked without a hitch so maybe it was just a server issue. Me and my brother however both did expeirence rubber banding playing Bumber Ball. Please Please show this mode some love, and get crazy with it!

Speaking of the Bumber ball mode. This has the potential to be something very special. Add a jump feature, maybe a ball camera, and run with it! More maps and even different variations would be amazing.!! I could see it blowing up much like Rocket league did.

The Career and Racing in general is just so much fun. The different camera angles and just the Art/Level design is Superb! The game really shines here. 

Overall this is a Easy 5 Star review. Wonderfully done.

Awesome game but one problem. The MP isn't working. Always shows my friend connecting.? It never connects. Will 100% move to 5 stars when this is resolved. Also just an idea, and maybe you have one, but a Discord server would be an awesome way to stay in touch with your community gain feedback, and even get ideas for future content. We love your game and wanna see it blow up!!","May 22, 2020 at 8:44 AM",5, 2,Hi GameJunky513 - thanks for the great review! Good to hear that multiplayer is working as intended. Sometimes you might experience some ball rubber-banding when servers are busy or if you happen to have connected to one in a different country. We do our best to use local servers whenever possible but sometimes it's not possible at that specific time. We're also monitoring feedback for Bumper Ball so we'll note your suggestions and see how things go as more people join in the fun :) Thanks again!
2022-05-28 20:31:48.156107,Anfronie,I love it!,"This is a great game to jump in and out of! I love the soccer ball game! The visuals are great and the user interface is fluid. One thing I think might help is if it is more obvious about how to get online for multiplayer. Instead of selecting ""Random Game/Match"" there should just be a button that says ""Go Online"" or something like that. I think that will help bring more people online to race/battle each other. Also, I kind of wish matches/races were longer. They seem to be over so quickly. I have not made a custom match yet so maybe I'll look into that but I love it so far!!","May 19, 2020 at 2:17 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for the great feedback, Anfronie! The idea behind the 'Party Bar', which is that constant bar at the bottom of the interface, was to make being online as transparent as possible since you can invite, drop in or out of multiplayer at any time, anywhere. It's a newer idea so perhaps you're right in that some people might be having trouble with it. We'll certainly keep an eye on it moving forward and work towards clarifying the system. Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 20:31:51.259405,dattatteddude10,Almost Perfect,"5/21 Update- MP worked tonight with pretty much no issues. racing together was smooth with no issues. played bumper ball (I have over 1k hours in rocket league) and it was an absolute blast!!! add a jump button, widen the goals just a little and make them a little taller and add a button to use a ball follow camera (like RL).

First off- game is outstanding! Great graphics, physics and very well optimized for a smooth vr experience. Controls are very easy or you can play with a xbox controller (I'm using the elite). Tons of tracks and a decent amount of cars. 

Next- need more customization! For your character to liveries to rims to custom paint. Also a map editor where the community can make and share maps. This would be cool!

Multiplayer was not working last night when me and brother tried. Closed and reopened the game a few times but after an invite it kept saying connecting. Hoping this gets fixed because campaign mp and bumper ball would be a blast!

Great work so far. Really hope to see more content for this game.","May 22, 2020 at 8:57 AM",5, 2,Hey dattatteddude10 - woah! That's some serious RL hours! Appreciate the feedback and we'll certainly take your suggestions on board as we continue monitoring the game. Thanks again! :)
2022-05-28 20:31:51.275363,shredhed64,"Lots of Fun, very addicting","First off this game runs silky smooth with everything turned up on my GTX1060, the gameplay is fast and addicting. Multiplayer can be a little sparse, but that could be due to the game being new... Controls are excellent, except for one thing.  The option to ""toggle hold""(assuming the steering wheel) doesn't seem to do anything when your in cockpit view(first-person), your hands can get a little tired squeezing the grip button after an hour or so.

Otherwise really fun game !!","May 28, 2020 at 5:35 AM",5, 0,"Thanks for the review, shredhed64! Good idea re the hold toggle...we'll see if we can get that added in a future patch :) Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 20:31:51.290323,joepayne79,Such a Blast!,"I can honestly say this is the only VR game that has kept me interested for hours other then Half Life Alyx. Very simple, but total blast. Growing up playing Off Road and RC-Pro am this is a dream come true. :) 

Hoping developer adds more tracks/DLC. I’ll gladly pay for more content. Great job guys!","May 28, 2020 at 2:43 AM",5, 0,"Thanks, joepayne79! Really appreciate that :)"
2022-05-28 20:31:51.307277,Neffypooh,Polished & Fun Casual Racer,"Update: Now that my controller issues have been resolved, I can write a proper review for this game. Be sure to disconnect your other controllers/joysticks if you are having issues. 

This is a fantastic casual racer with lots of charm and personality. I can tell a lot of love and care went into designing the cars and race tracks; the vibrant colors, the lighting, the music and the racing all just convey fun in a neat little package. The gameplay loop is fairly simple: you race, earn money, upgrade your car, and repeat. You unlock more cars by hitting milestones in the career mode (the rest can be purchased). The attention to detail is outstanding. There is a high level of polish just about everywhere you look, from the touch controls in the lobby/garage, to the various cameras and control schemes you can use while driving. The overall experience is just a blast. They even have cross-platform multiplayer and a rocket league game mode. A solid addition to your VR library. I highly recommend it.","May 29, 2020 at 2:31 AM",5, 0,"Update: So glad you were able to track that issue down, Neffypooh. We're looking into idea of how we might be able to handle that issue from our end also. Appreicate you working through it providing such a great review. :) 

Hi Neffypooh - sorry to hear about your control issues. This sounds very strange indeed! Have you tried any of the virtual controls to see if they exhibit similar issues? Perhaps try the virtual wheel and let us know as reference. Also, and this should have been fixed in the latest update, but not being able to select anything from the final menu would suggest that you have the Control Help up (Y button on Touch) which locks out user input. If you would be so kind as to reach out to us at https://thebinarymill.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new we can get to the bottom of what might be happening here and get you back racing ASAP. Thank you! :)"
2022-05-28 20:31:51.323235,ShineHunter,Great Micro Machines ctype game,"Watch my video via this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Lb6YUrUJ4

Graphical it is very beautiful and the colours pop right out at you. Low textures, but the way it is all done you have to give a high five to the developers because it looks good, very good.
Audio has all the right sound and there good enough for this type of Micro Machine clone.
Gameplay is where it is at. Multiplayer online or with some friends is a huge amount of fun. Lots of cars, helmets, gloves and steering wheels to pick from. Career mode and quick play. Many tracks and modes. There is a Rocket League type mode too. Cross play plus cross buy this is a huge winner.
I would recommend this game.","Jun 10, 2020 at 6:06 AM",5, 1,"Thanks very much for the great review (and video!), ShineHunter! We love to see feedback like this :) Hope to see you in the game sometime!"

2022-05-28 20:31:54.471383,RuneSR2,My new favorite VR racing game!,"Admitted I did not expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! Graphics looks pretty much like some awesome Sega arcade machine, the level of details is really impressive. The sea is filled with all sorts of fish, seagulls are in the air, sunken aeroplanes in the water etc. Textures are really good when zoomed out, but not that good zoomed in. Even if you can sit in the car, the zoomed out perspective is much better - and will not result in nausea. The game started using res 1.4 on my rig and all other settings maxed. I got perfect 90 fps, so performance is also amazing.
I don't think the Quest can provide even close to the graphics delivered by this game, it feels like a true PCVR version. Note that the PCVR version is 4.2 GB while the Quest version is just 1.7 GB, so they're not at all the same. 
This game is great fun for both kids and adults - and you can play singleplayer, coop and multiplayer. $25 for this level of quality is ok with me - but do try it and refund if you don't agree.","May 15, 2020 at 9:27 PM",5, 9,Hi RuneSR2 - glad we were able to surprise you :) Appreciate the kind words!
2022-05-28 20:31:54.489336,Bangieboy,Strap yourself in for a wild ride!,"What can I say other than this is the best Quest game to date, and the most fun I have had in VR, like, ever. I was late back to work from my break because I was playing this! Frantic, daft, adrenaline fuelled crazy racing with great visuals and a varied amount of cars and tracks, with various modes and camera views. My fave view is from inside the car, it just feels like you are shoe-horned into this crazy little car and you put pedal to the metal, careening around corners with your heart pounding!  It's extremely immersive from all camera views though. I didn't get motion sick playing this, but after draining my Quest's battery playing this I did feel a bit like I had just crawled out of a tumble dryer, but in a good way! If you own a Quest this is a must have, without question. Just brace yourself for a very crazy, wild ride.","May 25, 2020 at 1:36 AM",5, 0,"Haha! Thanks for the great review, Bangieboy!"
2022-05-28 20:31:54.506290,bridak,Small Request,"Really great game, but one thing is spoiling it for me. Maybe I've missed it in the settings but I would really like an option to turn off the view switching once the race has started. I'm switching views by accident in about 50% of my races at the moment and end up dropping places because of it. Any chance this can be added if it doesn't already exist? Thanks.","May 24, 2020 at 11:25 PM",5, 0,"Hi bridak - yep, there's an option for that :) In the Comfort menu, change the VR camera to 'Double Click' and it should fix your accidental camera switching.
