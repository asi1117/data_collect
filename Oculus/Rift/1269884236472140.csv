2022-05-28 19:27:13.377228,ToothBone,Bad and a horrible test of Vr legs,"Simply not a functional test of your VR resiliance. It basically just spins you around, and doesn't functionally offer any idea of what VR will be like for any person. Ask yourself, do you get motion sickness in a boat or plane? If you do, you won't like this nor will you like VR. No need for this application which is non-functional and hardly an adept way to see if you will be affected by VR.","Mar 19, 2020 at 9:12 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:27:13.391191,Gonzaxpain,Didn't work for me,"Ok, I did like 4 times, I think I was at level 3-4 when all of a sudden it stops and stays there, no ranking, no movement, nothing. I guess it's some kind of bug but it happened to me every single time I tried it. I have great VR legs so I guess I could make it to the end but I would have liked to see the final results. Anyway, good app to test your vr legs. If you're prone to sickness just stay away from this.","Apr 15, 2019 at 1:09 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 19:27:13.406151,Blahde,Worth a shot.,"It's OK. I have my VR legs as it were but I guess when I first started this would likely have done me in. These days, it was very light. 
Fun to try though and I got a 'so called'  Top 96% 3* Whatever that means. 
I know next time I try it would be 98% or 90% who knows how they score it. But it was a fun diversion and I know it would make newbies to VR feel ill/Puke ;-)","Oct 18, 2018 at 4:43 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:27:16.557722,SPLARK,It was good!,"It was a perfect test... but...
Why would it need your IP?? Does the age and gender even make a difference? What I am most worried about is THE IP.
Why would they need the IP?!?!?!!","May 6, 2018 at 10:16 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 19:27:16.572682,Nemeziz,,"I got 3 stars and rated better than 99% of users apparently, and as another ""old lady"" I was pretty pleased about that. Did it standing up and looking around the 2nd time. Was certain;y disorienting. Needs some barrel roles. I used to get sea sick when I was younger. I wonder if I still would? It was fun so thanks.","Apr 11, 2018 at 7:08 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:27:16.588639,nightcat.mau,Great Fun And Useful,"This old lady got three stars, so I'm almost immune to VR sickness. The test itself is fun, if you like being spun around or swung, and kind of like a theme park ride. Suppoedly if you willingly share your data it helps the testers in some way. I think it was pretty fair as far as testing goes. And it is supposed to make us dizzy, so it was great fun.","Mar 19, 2018 at 4:05 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:16.604596,scbroodsc2,"Tried it, I can deal with it","I've experienced a couple games with motion that can give sickness to some people, but personnaly I don't get motion sickness. This app was interesting to try, but to me it felt easy. My brain got used to vr and knows it's in vr therefore it relies on other senses to feel the real world instead of vision. Something though about this app is it move too fast making the image kind of jump and not move smoothly. I'm pretty sure there are ways of making this app better for testing like combining different pitch roll and maybe have stuff coming at you, etc. 
 Anyway, it could have been a full game I would have got 100%.","Mar 10, 2018 at 4:29 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:27:16.619557,VirtuaLieven,Perfect test,"I only installed this for testing, and to prove that any bad ratings are wrong. This app makes you dizzy, YES, and that's what it's made for, that's what the description says. If you don't ""like"" it, doesn't mean you should downrate it.
I give it 5 stars because it exactly does what it promises, not because it's nice or fun or useful.","Feb 20, 2018 at 10:09 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:27:19.707298,Sanka31,"Good for testing itself, but  be aware","I saw someone complaining, well... We are a conscious beings, can't blame others when the app's description is corect ! So yes, this app can (and should) make you sick. Interesting for me, because I was VERY sensitive to tVR sicknes when I had my DK2. But now, I'm used to it. I won't pretend this app gave me no discomfort, but it's OK, I can easely deal with it now ! So this app is good for people wanting to test themselves as they get used to VR, and it's always usefull to get stats of this bad side of VR. Just a suggestion to developpers, the first test should be done  sitted, to avoid people unaware falling if they don't stand it. Then, if people ""survive"" the first test, the app sould ask to stand up !","Dec 25, 2017 at 1:35 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:27:19.723255,crazycrads,really???,"first off no game ever made me feel that dizzy! vr games are made to reduce the effects that this app is trying to cause, that itself is one reason of many why this is an inacurate test. to me this app is bad for vr because if i watched this befor i brought my rift i would might have not got it!!! i would never of had the enjoyment i get from vr and thats an unsettling thought indeed. its a real shame the content flawed as it may be was still of good quality and well made could of had protential but instead took a massive wrong turn.

and for goodness sake do not stand up and watch this you may fall and break a bone or worse your rift or pc or even worse then that, you could even come down with a bad case of deadness :P","Nov 25, 2017 at 4:39 AM",1, 5,
