2022-05-28 20:30:16.043779,BrentBradburn,Nice practice gym,"Last year, I played this quite a bit  -- for exercise.  I stopped because a ball-positioning bug broke the illusion, but that has now been fixed (thank you to the devs).  I've updated my rating from 1 to 3 stars for now.  I may update again later if I get back into it.

The shooting physics, including backboard/rim are good, in my opinion.  The ball release might have room for improvement, but it works OK for me -- especially if I get my legs into it (hence the exercise).

I wish you could bounce/toss then catch the ball (ideally even after shooting).  As is, you have very limited options for where to shoot from -- even in the practice gym.  That's OK, but not great.

The minigames are basically intolerable for single player, for various reasons -- for starters, I can't seem to skip the intros, so there's a lot of downtime.  But the practice gym, by itself, makes this worthwhile for me.","May 8, 2021 at 9:36 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:30:16.059244,cav800,Very average VR basketball game,"Hoops Madness is nothing special at all. It looks and feels low budget and is appropriately priced. There are no graphic options in the game. Basketballs don't look like real basketballs and they feel more like tossing balloons. The screen flashes black when you teleport and there are anti-aliasing issues as well. The game also seems more meant for online play than single player because it prompts you to log in or you won't have access to certain features. If you want a really cool VR basketball experience, get VR Shoot Around on Steam. It has so many sliders to where you can make it arcady or extremely realistic. The choice is yours. And the physics are truly impressive.","Apr 13, 2021 at 12:14 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 20:30:16.075202,YoeyYutch,Best VR basketball,"This is the best basketball I've tried.  It looks great. I was having a decent time just shooting around in the practice facility.  Then when I tried a game mode, I was blown away by the arena! Very cool atmosphere! Great idea animating the seats.

Shout out to the developer for responding to my feedback. It feels good to be part of the process. Adding the option to shoot with trigger makes it so much more fun!  I should also mention that the ball position issue has been fixed. 

It's a very polished game for the price tag.  I hope more people give it a shot. The online multiplayer will be really fun. Let's hoop it up people!","Mar 23, 2021 at 12:28 PM",5, 1,"Thanks SO much for the 5 Star review, YoeyYutch! This means a great deal to us. You have been so instrumental to us in helping us to make this game better. Please keep being a part of the process! We will keep you posted on any cool events. We the devs would love to hoop it up with you. :)"

2022-05-28 20:30:16.105122,VRDave,Great Social Basketball Game,"We all know that a big part of playing casual basketball is to play with friends. This game nails the social aspects of basketball with easy match-making and built-in voice chat. More people need to jump in this game and play so there is always people to play with. It definitely makes the game more fun.

The game modes are pretty standard but well excuted and a ton of fun to play. It's like a party game made for basketball fans and casual players alike. The user interfaces are cleverly integrated into the spaces using real-world objects that fit the theme of the entire experience. 

I'm not very big into scores and rankings, but the game does have it's own player accounts that lets you track your scores for different game modes and even offers tournaments.","Jan 6, 2021 at 2:46 AM",5, 1,
