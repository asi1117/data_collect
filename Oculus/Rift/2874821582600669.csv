Again, this is really cool because besides this game there are also other games from the developer that make VR games for musical instruments or other Balinese gamelan.

My advice, maybe it would be great if the multiplayer feature was made and each player could play gamelan music simultaneously, aka collaboration. This is just a suggestion, not a criticism. I hope it will be realized.

Overall, this game deserves to be developed and disseminated to promote arts in Indonesia, especially Bali, where Bali is the center of the island most frequently visited by foreigners around the world.","Mar 10, 2021 at 11:49 AM",5, 0,thanks for your review.
