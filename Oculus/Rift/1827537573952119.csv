2022-05-28 19:42:12.733226,Lowbill,Relaxing but dated,"The ambient sounds are the strongest aspect of this program, while the visuals are generally not as appealing and seem dated. At the current sale price it's worth it for the home environment, with soothing rain sounds, but overall it's mediocre by current standards.","Dec 26, 2020 at 12:48 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:42:12.759155,kagalive85,Not bad for the price...,"Tranquility includes 3 seperate scenes where you sit back and relax, meditate or just listen to the music playing.

The graphics aren't amazing, but they are adequate. The music is quite relaxing but it would be nice if you could choose what music to play, and be able to turn it off without just muting your speakers. 

More scenes and the ability to move around each area would make this a much better title, as it currently stands though you can't really go wrong for the price. 

3/5","Sep 12, 2020 at 8:33 AM",3, 3,
