2022-05-28 18:54:14.893963,kagalive85,Not your traditional roller coaster ride,"For those of you looking for a standard roller coaster ride, skip this title. If, on the other hand you are looking for an on-rails scenic tour then this might be your cup of tea. 

Yes, the ride starts off (and finishes) with a traditional roller coaster experience, but midway through you'll find yourself slowing right down, as you transition into a boat ride that is very slow paced. 

It's fairly immerisve, and fairly enjoyable but not exactly what it claims to be. 

Price paid: $3 USD
Worth: $3 USD

Whilst this is not a classic roller coaster experience it's visuals and variety of scenes do offer a fairly unique and immersive experience. You get what you pay for.","Aug 17, 2020 at 12:51 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:54:14.921889,tim.ayres.56,Creative Work of Art,"Newbie to VR and of course enjoying the best coaster games for thrills but this one is different, full of imagination and great designs, with many surprises from mechanics to concept.  And longer experience than the rest. Clearly a labor of love and I would say a work of art as much as a simple game experience. Bravo.","Jan 26, 2020 at 11:21 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:14.940838,gregvassallo,really knows how to make your head spin,"motion sickness people DON'T DO THIS!!! it truly knows how to make your head spin.  there are a couple times when you are upsidedown so yeah. they  nailed the mystery part as you never know whats coming. the scenery is very nice looking. there are like 2 minor jumpscares. but they are minor. one when the mine cart stops in the darkness and another at the river. although that one is not really a jumpscare. the music is great. when you enter the game there is a  white dot that moves as you move your head. if theres a sign like for example, ""skip enterance and go directly to ride"" move you,r head set so the white dot goes on the sign. if you put it on it long enough it does what it says. the right touch controls thumbstick is used for moving and the left is used for turning. when you are done with the ride (you end up where you started it's a closed loop) you can get out and there is some pictures the game took of the coaster in action. (it doesn't capture you) and then you can walk around to the entrance. there is some nice scenery that you have along the way. and there is a dock where you can look out into the sand. it looks amazing. there is 4 seats you can choose to sit in using the ""moving your headset with the white dot"" method i told earlier. overall it's a solid experience that is totally worth it","May 26, 2019 at 7:50 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:14.956795,Angelina Starr,Two big issues for me,"If the devs want this to be a solid 4 or 5 star ride, first and foremost, they need to fix the POV when the cart turns and leans.  As it is now, the cart is turning and leaning under my body and unless I tilt my head, the immersive feel was totally lost.  A real buzz kill, quite frankly.  

Also, they need to shorten the water feature by at least half, maybe more.  It was boring and tedious after the first minute and lent nothing to the experience.","Mar 10, 2019 at 2:21 AM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 18:54:18.118339,NFFC_RED_DOG,,"very smooth ride compared to some vr coasters. The design an layout is well put together.  Much longer ride than most of the others

BUT ... if you want a fast paced coaster experience, dont buy. If you want to just chill out going 5mph for half of the ride... then your in luck","Oct 28, 2018 at 2:44 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:54:18.135293,karsten.kowalk,,"I tried many VR Coasters and for me this one is the definite winner! You get a long and beautifully designed ride with lots of creative ideas, it never gets boring. The good sound design adds perfectly to the atmosphere. Graphics are good and very smooth. The developers add frequent updates. A clear recommendation if you are into Rollercoasters!","Oct 6, 2018 at 1:15 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:54:18.166211,I-M_BlackShaddow,Really enjoyed it.,"I liked it ... 
Like the ability to walk around.  Movment/View choices are what I would have chosen.

I detail a fiew 'Gliches', WHICH SHOULD NOT PUT ANYONE OFF PRCHASING.

1).  The view is locked to the horizon, rather than the Cart?!?
2).  In the Water section,  in some of the tunnels, the mid range wall textures are just black.
3).  In Shadow, Some colour is disappering, ruther than dulling.
4).  The Fog/Mist, is Not Blending, and with Lens Flare included, becomes very Blocky.
.
Thanks for a Super Ride.","Oct 11, 2018 at 12:29 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:54:21.274896,petersgrandadventure,Fantastic Ride!,"Using a rolly chair and someone to tickle your head when you go through the diamond part make this exceptional. So much that could only be done in VR, great job!","Sep 10, 2018 at 2:46 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:54:21.289857,Daimomaru,Smooth Sailing,"Super smooth, long and fun (the worst thing ever is a stuttery VR Roller Coaster).  Wlaking freely around the area before sitting on the kart was unexpected and interesting.  Nice feeling of momentum.  I felt a bit too tall while sitting, and my head clipped through some objects, but I think the culprit was my set up.  I didn't check the options to see if I could adjust height.  But a nice ride nonetheless.","Apr 1, 2018 at 1:06 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:54:21.304816,Gutspike,,"This is actually one of the better Rollercoater rides I have seen. Overall very good, but does lack the jumpscare factor.  Needs more in your face VR stuff, eg a octupuss tentacle trying to catch you on the water or bricks falling from above , stuff like that to make the ride more enjoyable.","Mar 27, 2018 at 4:54 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:54:24.427464,FastLawyer,It's an above average rollercoaster,"This is not the best rollercoaster in VR for the Rift.   The best rollercoaster is still G2A underwater adventure (although it's technically a submarine ride, it is exactly like a VR roller coaster otherwise).  The graphics are not there for this game, especially when you compare it to G2A.  There's not a lot of wow moments.  However, it does have a lot of positive things.  First and foremost, this is a decent length rollercoaster.  So you will get your $2.99 money's worth of content here.  There's nice use of light and shadows.  There's quite the variety in the ride.  There's some slow moments, there's some very fast moments, you go to underwater caves, you go outside the park and see some vistas.  The ghosts that appear are actually among the most disappointing, simply because the animations are so poorly done.   There's an option to walk around to enter and to exit the amusement park manually, there's no point to that.  I'm not sure what the dev was thinking, having a long walk with little to see is not fun.  Definitely just teleport straight into the ride, do not walk there.  I would rate this rollercoaster a 6.5/10 at normal price of $2.99 USD.","Jan 27, 2018 at 9:13 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 18:54:24.473341,theregoes2,Two good roller coasters in one day!,"Until today there were no coasters that I felt were really good on Rift. The best coaster was Rilix on Gear VR. But this one and the other one that released today are both really good. This one is a lot harder on the stomach though. These one should be used by seasoned veterans only. There is a part near the end where it becomes a river ride and that's gentle, but it does transition back to a coaster and will test the limits of your VR legs. It's fast, smooth, with cool music, scenery and plenty of stuff that's only possible in VR. If you like VR coasters you should really try this one.","Jan 25, 2018 at 12:48 PM",4, 0,
