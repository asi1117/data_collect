2022-05-28 18:10:29.631574,DelapierceD,Interactive Music Video,Super rad. Create/Enhance the visuals presented by the music. Love this. And love the song,"Mar 10, 2021 at 12:49 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:29.646534,SmotPoker1977,I love this it made me feel trippy,Great tune and cool visuals well done.,"Mar 7, 2020 at 4:25 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:10:29.660497,HarbingerThrace,Great song,"Love seeing music videos in VR.  Keep it up.  Song is great, I'll be checking out your album =)","Feb 8, 2020 at 3:51 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:10:29.675457,mrchriskeegan,Interesting to play with,Would be great to see them do another one. This time i would happily pay a couple of pounds for the experience. Maybe with two pieces of music to play with. Great!,"Mar 23, 2020 at 6:37 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:29.690417,MatherForce,Amazing,These guys really hit the nail on the head with this one. Amazing. Looking forward to seeing more.,"Oct 20, 2018 at 6:52 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:10:32.807081,Captain_Howdy,Not too bad...,"But I liked ""Show it to me"" way better as far as replayability goes
This has more effects to play with, but not my kind of music","Sep 5, 2018 at 11:07 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:32.822041,sirpresage,One time experience,"It's nice to hear and relatively beautiful, interaction with controllers doesn't seemed to have impact on music tough, making it useless for me. Just sit and enjoy, once.","Jun 18, 2018 at 6:06 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:32.836003,mikrofab,Top Notch !,I like the music and the VR / sound interaction. For me this is some excellent kind of modern art. Thanks for that one !,"Apr 4, 2018 at 3:48 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:32.849967,HisRoyalMajestyM,Missing that WOW factor.,"Not as trippy as Fantasynth, not as interactive as Chroma Lab, but free. Personally prefer trancy tunes with that kind of videos, rather than oddly slow and kind of depressing rock that was in this experience. Even though it was in open space, I felt confined by the minimal level of swirling visuals that were kind of bolted down by strong gravitational pull of the center mass.","Jan 12, 2018 at 7:48 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:10:32.864926,HiThere_,Short but fun,"At first it felt really boring because I didn't seem to have much control, but by the end of the song I figured out how to use (both) Touch controllers to surround myself with a flow of particles, making it feel like I had just solved a mini-puzzle game within a one song time limit. Only 3 stars because it lacks color and it's just one song (it's not an audio player).","Jan 17, 2018 at 7:42 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 18:10:35.995553,Parallaxed,A Really Cool Experience,"Make sure to get used to the controller functions and then have fun!  I thought I saw a moon,  but perhaps it was no moon at all...The monochrome feel of the environment works very well but adding a bit of color would really throw the experience over the top..","Jan 17, 2018 at 1:13 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:10:36.011510,mschaefer123,Solid Art Direction,"All around great experience. The only feedback is there were a couple times the background world shifted and was disorienting. I spend a lot of time in flight and racing sims. So maybe its the camera controlling the movement, instead of my own input, that threw me off.","Jan 14, 2018 at 5:42 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:36.026470,Atv821,Pretty boring after the first 2 minutes,You only manipulate two spheres of motion on top of a pretty lackluster and boring female vocalist song. Combined with the entire experience being in black and white I was yawning after only a minute or two into the video. I'd pass.,"Jan 18, 2018 at 2:57 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:36.041431,Valver,Really good VR music experience!,"I loved this.  Not usually my type of music, but despite that, the interactive and stylish VR visuals (which remind me of the old PC demo scene stuff) totally engrossed me.  Great job!  Well worth the  download and probably worth demoing to friends too.","Jan 12, 2018 at 6:27 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:10:39.110222,FlyingDoodle,Wonderful!!,"This will be the future in music, whereby artist will release VR music albums and fans can particpate and become immersed in the music of their favorite artists. Enjoyed the download VR experience and will use this to demo to friends..","Jan 13, 2018 at 11:25 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:39.125182,Vantablack_,Pretty lame.,"Well the effects are good, but not very outstanding. It gets boring after a few minutes and the music is not my type of music. I should stop install every thrash, just because it is free. This one is waste of time.","Jan 13, 2018 at 11:24 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:10:39.139145,neuro27,Great experience - check it out!,"Cool interactive visualizer paired with good music. It's free and quick, so there's no reason not to check this out. I always love seeing where artists can take their ideas and how VR is such a powerful medium for exploring that.","Jan 15, 2018 at 12:52 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:10:39.154105,KamonegiX,MMXII,Very nice experience. Hope there will be more VR Music Videos from all kind's of artists in the future. Since I quite enjoyed Phantom's music style and the main vocalist I went ahead and bought their album MMXII on Bandcamp. :),"Jan 13, 2018 at 11:32 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:39.168067,Magnum666,,"Not bad, but you probably need to burn something or suck it in to get the desired effect, like  the artist took it before making this clip :-P? Too chaotic and no sync-interaction with music.","Jan 15, 2018 at 1:55 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:42.282737,Lumen,Good job!,Just the right amount of immersion and interactivity. The visuals are not the normal garish mash of flashing pixels. I look forward to experiencing more of your creations!,"Jan 15, 2018 at 8:20 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:10:42.297697,pigtripper,Good...for a while,"It was a decent song and fun to play with the visuals, but about halfway through, things started rotating and revolving and dizziness set in.  Be aware if you are prone to motion sickness.","Jan 12, 2018 at 5:30 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:42.312657,Bob-Rolha,The controls for particles aren't fun,"I thought I would enjoy it, but I did not see anything too much.

2022-05-28 18:10:42.341579,bcool123,Good!,"The music wasn't really my thing and the 3D video of the band didn't really work, but the rest of the visuals were a real joy to play with!","Jan 13, 2018 at 11:48 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:10:54.928913,XtremeHardcoreGamer,I liked it!,"I liked the music and presentation. The underlying technology was very neat too. I would love for an app that used this tech with one's own music library. Preferably with less interaction, sometimes a person just wants to sit back and enjoy the music with visuals.","Jan 30, 2018 at 12:20 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:10:54.943873,Falcon_DS_,A must see,"More like this please.  The track for my tastes is so-so but that's a personal musical taste thing.  However, the visuals and interaction with the generated visuals (and the visuals you can generate yourself) are superb.  Make sure you stay till the end and really mess about with the vortex using all of the controller's buttons and sticks to generate, move and rotate; it is a real joy...","Jan 13, 2018 at 6:24 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:10:54.957836,FastLawyer,It's just okay,"This experience should have been more exciting than it was.  I'm not sure what holds it back from being great.  Maybe it's the music.  It started out nice enough, but then the second half really lost me.  The visuals are nice, but the greyscale was not a good option to maximize our enjoyment of the interaction with the particles.  The background is actually very nice.  Nice star system.  The Death star is there.  But it just fell flat overall.  It's free and it runs smoothly.  It's a try once and then uninstall.","Jan 12, 2018 at 1:52 PM",3, 0,
