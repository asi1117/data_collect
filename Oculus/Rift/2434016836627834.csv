2022-05-28 16:43:59.587566,Zorritini,,"Probably the closest thing to a 'VR cartoon' I've seen to date. Lovely toy rocket style and cute characterisation at points. 

By 'cartoon' you should totally expect something short and sweet, with the interactions just adding a bonus bit of protaganist glitz, rather than gameplay as such.

The second ending option didn't add a huge amount, but playing it through again revealed bits I'd missed each time, and revealed just how much work they'd put into the alien character.

2022-05-28 16:43:59.601529,GARTEH,Charming short narrative,"Good quality animations and voices. I found the short story very charming and caught myself smiling a few times. However, due to the length of the content you're purchasing, I cannot recommend it when not on sale.","May 23, 2020 at 8:04 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:43:59.616489,All-Gass-No-Breaks,Excellent cross-buy experience!,Great interactive movie to show the family. I would genuinely like to thank the developers for making the experience cross-buy so I can now show friends and family this excellent experience on my new Quest! Thank you!,"Dec 24, 2019 at 4:59 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:43:59.630451,FastLawyer,"Your choice doesn't matter, ~15 minutes","So I think this is a good cinematic short with some very light interactions that are basically point and click to grab the object and use it. There is no locomotion. Whole thing takes about 15 minutes. It's a 360 seated experience and it's running on the Unity Engine. Triple A quality all around.

However, the story is really the weakpoint. It's cute though, especially the alien you get to pet. Perfect for families or kids. Just the story really goes nowhere and your choice just means you get a slightly different dialogue, bu it's of no real consequence. It really glosses over the destruction of the planet Earth and makes it seem like the colonization of another nearby planet would ever be feasible if we were to destroy our planet. I think the other free Baobab VR cinematic shorts are actually better than this one (even though this one has light interactions). Buy to support Boabab of if you have kids or kids at heart to enjoy this.","Dec 3, 2019 at 2:21 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:43:59.647407,voxinator,Too short for $9.99. Excellent quality!,"When I purchased this I was unaware that it would only be a 10-15 minute runtime. Since it's essentially an interactive movie, there's relatively little replayability. I've spent $9.99 on other products on this store and enjoyed many hours of benefit. This was excellent for the few minutes it lasted. I think this format could be monetized as a $4.99 episodic adventure similar to Telltale's model. $9.99 is just too much for me to feel anything but disappointed.","May 25, 2019 at 5:48 AM",4, 24,

2022-05-28 16:44:02.784017,Aquavemo,This short is too short...,"But hey, since i enjoyed all the other great Baobab stuff for free - especially ""Crow: The Legend"" - i can finally give you something for that too. Cant wait for your next project!","Jul 9, 2019 at 3:05 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:44:02.797979,JackHasBeenTaken,If I paid for this I would be mad,I got this game as a bundle with The Climb for cheaper than either game individually. The game was fun but lasted less then an hour and has zero replayability. If I paid full pirce for this I'd be going for a free refund.,"Jun 15, 2019 at 12:29 AM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 16:44:02.826902,jrec15,It's alright,"Gonna be honest, I got this cause it was bundled with the climb and figured why not. It's slightly charming and not a bad way to spend 15 minutes, but I wouldn't recommend it at $10. I wasn't particularly moved by the story though others may be more into it than me. It's funny at times, and has some decent VR interactivity. Maybe pick it up on a sale","May 27, 2019 at 7:35 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:44:05.917635,tlm2021,Beautiful VR Storytelling,"I didn't know what to expect firing this up, and I think that's the best way to experience it. This is a funny, beautiful, and surprisingly poignant piece of VR storytelling. It is short, but the characters shine. Recommended for anyone who enjoys VR for more than gaming.","May 29, 2019 at 1:15 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:44:05.932595,UserDoesNotExist,Great story,"Now, I want this to be cheaper as it is very small for $9.99, but the story and animation are amazing. I love this game as it is very heartfelt. I could go deeper but I simply suggest to buy this in a bundle for cheaper. For example, The Climb bundle.","May 25, 2019 at 7:34 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:44:05.946558,AesirSW,Very Cute but very short,"I got this in the Rift S Duo pack with The Climb. 30 minutes of wholesome, slightly interactive animation. It was nice but that's as much content as there is here.","Jun 4, 2019 at 2:00 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 16:44:09.110097,iloveVRnarrative,Good blend of interactivity and narrativ,"Super immersive experience that lets me interact the whole time, not just at specific moments.  Eating marshmallows was my favorite - it even makes eating noises.  Was a fun easter egg!  I actually cared about the characters and the story.  Super fun experience.","May 24, 2019 at 3:17 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:44:09.125057,RobotScott33,Great demonstration of vr,"A short, easy to use, vr experience with a great sense of presence. I can see this replacing ""the blu"" as my goto app for showing people vr for the first time.","May 24, 2019 at 1:19 PM",5, 10,
