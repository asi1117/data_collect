Thank you for your comment. Sorry to read that the experience may have been uncomfortable. Did you try with the teleport locomotion ? if you prefer the free locomotion, you can also set the speed of movement and rotation in the main menu to get a more pleasant experience. If you have any other suggestions for improvement, please let me know. Thank you !"

There are a variety of puzzles, from easy to hard. If you run into trouble there are two levels of hint for each puzzle. I only needed those a couple of times and with one exception I wish I had just spent more time thinking about the solution. The graphics are pretty basic, but they serve their purpose well. I only found one bug: the teleport orientation does nothing. Doesn't really affect gameplay once you realize. It is a brand new game, I'm sure the dev will fix it soon anyway.",Jul 18 at 10:54 PM,5, 14,
