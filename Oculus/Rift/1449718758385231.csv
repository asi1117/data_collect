To make it good. please make the UI (handsfunctions) similar to Oculus home's while rearranging the house. The thumbstick should be used to move an item into the distance and place it far away. Right now if you click the Y, B button your hands switch between far from your body and close at fixed distances. which is super unpractical. Also considering that X , A are the back to menu buttons and it totally erases what you're doing. (like for example rearranging bones and reassembling to remember what went where) Then you go back to a menu that is composed out of buttons that you have to grab with those same riddiculous handcontrols. it feels like walking on stelts with your hands. please just make that into a simple point and select interface. the UI is REALLY stupid and cripples the whole thing the more I think about it. I wanted to use this to study basic anatomy. And it's almost good enough for that.. such a shame.... please update. I'm literally on the edge between keeping and asking for a refund. If nothing improves I feel that I've wasted money, so please let us know if it's in your plans. Also if you want to make it better than good add more intricate content for the next level doctors. and add a better homescreen UI.  cmon guys finish this app! Make it perfect!","Feb 8, 2019 at 8:58 AM",3, 5,

This app is definitely on the right track but as it mentions, only has a limited musculoskeletal system. As a medical student it doesn't have anywhere near the amount of detail I need. Organon is still much better content-wise but I really like the idea of seeing the 3D tags popping out at me identifying the various structures. It could use a way to make the actual bones smaller and larger, rather than having to change your view by increasing the distance between your virtual hands and face. I couldn't give it lower than a 3/5 because I really really like what the app is trying to do, but as I said, not enough content to warrant a 4 or 5.","Nov 6, 2017 at 1:04 PM",3, 17,
