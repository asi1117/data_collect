2022-05-28 19:50:01.976145,ashiren,only problem is are the controllers.,"Summary:  The graphics are the same like any other game and the controllers aren't the best.   

Graphics:  The graphics for the game is okay.

Gameplay: Like any other typical counter fight games, it's pretty much the same with the exception of the controllers.  I really wish the controllers were better like the other counter fight games.","Dec 9, 2019 at 12:04 PM",3, 1,

The french fries are like super balls, and impossible to find if/when you drop them. The guns fall through the table when zombies come in.  Just try to grab a lobster or a cup with your ham fists.  The customer timelines are much shorter than the last game.  To top all of this off, once or twice per game, everything will pause while you are moving, and the world will have shifted to wherever you end up being.  This seems like it could be fun, but is largely not playable right now","Oct 27, 2019 at 7:49 AM",1, 4,
