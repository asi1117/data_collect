2022-05-28 19:15:59.304133,Nickdbb12,Didn't Run/Bad Support,"Game didn't run for me when I bought it, 10 months later I try to play it again and it doesn't work so I reached out to them and they told me to wait 6 months and hopefully it might help. Support is useless, and its been almost a year with no fix.","Apr 20, 2020 at 3:36 PM",1, 2,

I realize the comfort is listed as intense, so that's not where I was disappointed. I found the stick handling difficult, (Im using a Rift) almost impossible to slapshot.   Some are saying the physics are life-like , I don't agree entirely - I think the physics are cool but they are not super realistic. I don't think you should try and make them realistic VR tech really isn't there yet. I think the stick is too short at the end where its on the ice. I haven't tried online play yet, and dont think I can until I get better ""VR legs"".","Jul 17, 2019 at 2:12 AM",3, 0,
