2022-05-28 19:36:39.177777,neuro27,Boring Marketing Tool,"With several different static viewpoints to choose from, you get to explore a virtual luxury loft in what looks like a very busy city.  The music is polite and beautiful, which is the nicest feature of the app. Because seriously, it is a very simple demo of a single home with a limited number of 360 photos in which to view it. That's it! If you're looking for a better experience along the real estate tract, please check out Realvision VR - they have at least 20 homes to choose from.","May 21, 2017 at 12:21 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 19:36:39.207697,karrtoon,Not that impressive.,I don't see any reason for this to be pre-rendered. I have seen several realtime archviz VR demos using UE4 that looking much better than this. There are very limited viewpoints to teleport too. In general it's very forgettable and has a lot of warping issues due to it being stereo cubemap views with no positional tracking or head/neck model.,"Nov 14, 2016 at 8:35 AM",1, 5,
