2022-05-28 15:36:58.051656,HappyBlackOwls,"Not my taste, but the art is fun","I just didn't like all of the butt stuff. Also that main little guy was giving me bad vibes, i would have liked it more if the were less emphasis on him. Props to the artists though it looks really nice and the wavy arms are fun",Feb 23 at 1:42 AM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:36:58.067614,Robbenz,"PARTY OF ONE, PARTY OF ONE","YESSSSSSSS, that was fun.  Get's the juices flowing and puts a stupid grin on your face.  I might start my day like this each morning!","Sep 11, 2020 at 12:55 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:37:01.255088,northbayray,5 Stars for Weirdness,"I got this bundled with another game and wasn't sure what to expect. One of the weirder things I've enjoyed on the Rift - but enjoy it I did. After about 30 seconds I was unable to wipe the grin off my face and there are parts that make me laugh out loud every time. I'm sure it's not for everybody, but it just might be for you.","Nov 22, 2018 at 12:59 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:37:01.269051,tom-tribexr,Weirdly fun,"so much fun in this experience - it's a bizarre trippy thing, but enjoyable. Hard to stop yourself drumming.","Feb 28, 2018 at 6:58 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 15:37:01.298971,JellyCoatedBean,So Much Fun!,Amazing little music video for a really catchy tune. Great way to show off how good VR can be. YOU GOTTA GET IT!,"Oct 2, 2017 at 4:14 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:37:04.407657,AlexFling,Amazing!,"I love these things.  They are such good quick experiences and leave you so happy.  So good to share this kind of things with friends that will appreciate some joyful,funny art and music.  More more more please!","Sep 21, 2017 at 3:32 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:37:04.421619,Recursophile,Pure Bliss,"Yes, it is short. But I have probably experienced it 50 times since I purchased it months ago and it never fails to make me smile and send chills down my spine as I dance around like an idiot. The interactive aspect is perfect.","Aug 20, 2017 at 11:37 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:37:04.435582,FastLawyer,Good but short,"Nice little VR experience, especially for anybody new to VR.  Catchy little tune and you get to be silly.  However, there's no real gameplay element.  You can sit and do nothing or you can dance along (assuming you don't trip over wires).  Just needs more to justify the price tag.","Aug 13, 2017 at 1:59 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:37:04.450542,greggman,Horrible,"I don't know what I was expecting but the reviews were good. I feel like they must be fans. This was about the cheapest, lamest productive yet.","Oct 2, 2017 at 5:13 PM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 15:37:07.575185,cdroulers,"Not bad, kind of fun, too short","Could be 5 stars if it was free. Doesn't worth paying for it, in my opinion.","Apr 23, 2017 at 3:44 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:37:07.589147,avatarius,Good fun,"This is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. It's the eye-contact and the little interactions that sell it, you feel like you're there and part of the world, with some sort of relationship to these odd little folk.  The sense of fun is infectious.  For my taste, you could still take one more big step away from the hip-thrusting little men, and go further towards psychadelic Yellow Submarine surrealism.","Mar 19, 2017 at 8:46 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:37:07.604107,warpwhistler,Pure delight,"I actually bought this game on Steam and AGAIN in the Oculus Store, just because I thought the developers of this deserved more of my money. It really is that joyous. Sure, it's only 3 minutes, but it's 3 minutes you'll want to dive back into again and again. I've spent more time dancing to this song than I have playing 90% of the games in my VR library. It's cheaper than an ice cream cone, and you will love it.","Jan 22, 2017 at 3:00 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 15:37:10.752686,cybernettr,It's OK,"Basically, an animated music video. Not the most spectacular graphics I've ever seen, not the greatest animation I've ever watched, and not the most fantastic song I've ever heard. It's over-hyped, and the WIRED quote is ridiculous. I personally liked Squarepusher on mobile better.","Feb 4, 2017 at 11:54 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 15:37:10.767647,VectorStreamsVR,my day went from bad to great,wasn't having the best day ever... decided to just try this out.. i mean ya only live once right... and boom i could not stop laughing.. everything was great. possibly the best vr dance party ever.. this game puts you in a place where you can dance ya butt off and be free and be yourself without a care...,"Jan 11, 2017 at 12:56 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:37:10.781608,plogarn,Pure happiness,"Wonderfully silly and playful experience, you can't avoid feeling happy! Also, it's one of the first apps that actually gives you a body.

Keep these music experiences coming, we need more of them!","Jan 8, 2017 at 5:07 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:37:10.796569,z3ta,Nice videoclip with Touch support,"Same characters of ""Butt: The VR experience"" introducing a funny song making use of a slippery virtual body with great coreography and a psicodelic scenery. But, IMHO, it is only one song with great visuals, and for than reason, too expensive.","Jan 12, 2017 at 2:06 PM",4, 2,
