2022-05-28 15:46:49.621462,Delmack4,Great Game,Unsure why everyone is complaining because the game worked extremely well for me. This is the 2nd game I bought when I first recieved my Oculus Go and after buying a new Quest 2 this is the first game I wanted to install. The only thing that is reasonable to criticize is the length but I'm still unbothered by it and I love the amount of choices you have.,Dec 22 at 3:23 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:46:49.636422,CeeJay726,Terrible Controls,"Interesting game, but why do I have to use my left hand to select? The controls seem backwards and I have to constantly remind myself what buttons to use, which makes this a tedious experience.",Oct 22 at 8:22 PM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:46:49.650385,Lalle75,"Very, very short","A very easy escape room kinda game. It consists of 4 episodes, each one with a playtime of about 15-20 minutes. I reached the end of the game after one hour, but it felt much shorter.
The puzzles and humor are ok. But I like ""I expect you to die"" more.
I won't request a refund, because 99 ct for 1 hour playing is Ok. Maybe my kids like to play it in a few years. But I wouldn't buy it again.","Jul 4, 2020 at 12:48 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:46:49.665345,Jellybird9,Pretty good for the price,Little confusing at times but i think that's just my brain trying to figure things out. Graphics are low but suit the game. Some humor it. All around pretty good game.,"Jun 4, 2020 at 11:53 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:46:49.681302,CrimsonCC,too Short but Fun aslong it last,I really wound rate it much more but how short the game is it take star out from it and end was not really that good it was expetic more,"Jul 6, 2019 at 2:08 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:46:52.819908,taquitobuddy,Frustrating and not really fun/funny,"A puzzle game with very hit-or-miss humor, my wife and I didn't care for it.  Also had some issues with the scale/roomscale of the game.  If you really like light/silly puzzle games might enjoy this, but wasn't for us.","Jan 2, 2019 at 6:28 AM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 15:46:52.834868,CidHighwind,,The puzzles in the game are not very good (especially in the last chapter) and the technical execution of the game is just bad. The biggest problem is that you can't see your own hands and UI elements can float inside objects.,"Dec 22, 2018 at 5:56 PM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:46:52.848830,Remigan,So enjoyable fun :),"So enjoyable fun :), short but very funny  imo","Nov 9, 2018 at 2:18 AM",5, 5,Thank you very much :-)
2022-05-28 15:46:52.863790,Seri-oke,"Puzzles aren't hard, but laughs were","This game is unique! I like problem solving and puzzles, so it's a great fit for me. Not really that thought provoking in the puzzle department...the graphics really are not that good...but very functional. The story and character actors had me cracking up. Dispite what others may think the gameplay is fun and I was engaged from the moment I was building the elveator.","Apr 1, 2018 at 1:14 PM",4, 6,Glad to hear you enjoyed the game. Thanks for playing!
2022-05-28 15:46:52.878750,polka_panda,Did not enchant,"I bought this in the hope that it would bring some of the joy that IEYTD did. Sadly, the magic wasn't there. The game is reasonable but (at least in the 45min I played) felt uninspired. The puzzles didn't feel connected, the protagonists weren't likeable... I can't pinpoint exactly why, but I didn't have much fun.


The Touch interactions felt off - perhaps it's because of having to pinch a fire extinguisher to pick it up instead of being able to grab it, or perhaps because the ""A"" button opens/closes the menu instead of selecting options (why don't they use the ""menu"" button for the menu?). The elevator is a bit too big for my space so I have to use the ""point and click"" version: it works but it's less exciting.


Overall, it's a reasonable game but it just didn't work for me.","Feb 25, 2018 at 3:54 AM",3, 4,"Thanks for the honest feedback! Sorry to hear it didn't work out for you, we will try to improve our 'Roomscale' version with further updates."
2022-05-28 15:46:55.981451,Cars0419,It was fun but short.,"Like majority of these VR naratives, they are short. This one took me about an hour. It is kinda fun to replay and get all the achivements again. The game is really well made though, my favorite was when you had build the ship.","Mar 7, 2018 at 9:35 AM",4, 3,Thanks a lot for your feedback!
2022-05-28 15:46:55.996411,LeeMajorz6k,Not bad!,"Single-room puzzle thingy with some quite good storytelling, despite the cringey humor. It's divided into 4 episodes, and each one ends on a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting to know what comes next. The puzzles are good and logical too. If you liked I Expect You To Die, you'll want to give this one a go as well.","Jan 13, 2018 at 10:14 PM",4, 2,"Thanks for your review! Honored by the comparison to ""I Expect You To Die""."
2022-05-28 15:46:56.011372,jeffreymaster8,great for its price,this is a great game that requires you to think fast and make decisions. there is comedy through out whole adventure. and it is fairly long which is nice in the long range. i would love to see more puzzle games with humor in it. developers put their heart and it really showed,"Nov 26, 2017 at 4:25 AM",5, 5,Aw Shucks! Thanks very much. It's great that people are making their way through the game at such different paces. Thanks again for your review.
2022-05-28 15:46:56.026332,Renemouse,Enjoyable puzzle game,"Arnie is the president of the world and needs to build da space elevator to get re-elected. You will help him. The game is a fairly simple point and click style puzzle, but works really well in VR. The constant radio banter is fun, and there are plenty of little things to interact with as you go. Not a difficult game at all - I finished within an hour and a half with no hints, and that's including watching the credits (which are a neat touch at the end).

The final boss is a bit tedious but the rest of the game was well paced. Perhaps one more level might have been nice but I recommend this regardless.","Nov 27, 2017 at 2:09 AM",5, 3,Thanks so much for the positive review and the great thoughtful feedback.

2022-05-28 15:46:59.141001,zack32h,Great Game for the Price,"This game was surprisingly fun with a decent story. It's nothing incredible, but it's great for the price.","Jan 2, 2018 at 6:18 AM",5, 2,Thanks!
2022-05-28 15:46:59.155961,curtispf,Fantastic little VR experience!,"Really intriguing puzzles - I got stuck quite a bit, but got there in the end! Hilarious voice acting and specially-composed music, too. Definitely worth the money.","Nov 18, 2017 at 12:33 AM",5, 5,"Glad you pulled through! Thanks a bunch for playing. The music was made by us and some super talented friends of ours, we'll pass your praise on to them. Thanks for playing!"
2022-05-28 15:46:59.172917,s.katborg,Great fun,"Absolutely worth the low asking price. Had so a blast with this game, even though the controls were a bit odd at times.","Dec 14, 2017 at 2:57 AM",4, 2,Thank you for playing! And we're still doing updates and trying to improve the controls where we can.
2022-05-28 15:46:59.187875,Valver,Got in an elevator to the moon...,And wasnt dissapointed!  Had some chuckles along the way.  Enjoyed the puzzles and the banter.  I even found two endings...,"Dec 12, 2017 at 6:47 AM",5, 2,Thank you for taking the time to play our game! Excited that you found both endings.
2022-05-28 15:46:59.204832,jim1709,Amazing,"This game is so good and for such a low price. A must have for sure.Also loved all the tapes with music in the game and I think the ""Elevator to the moon"" song was so great.Did a great job with this one devs cant wait for another one of your games.","Nov 26, 2017 at 7:24 PM",5, 1,The tapes were super fun to put in. The Moon Elevator song we found on Spotify after finishing the original demo. We reached out to the band los diablos blancos and it made it into the game. Such great fit! Cheers :-)
2022-05-28 15:47:02.302545,lorenfel,Fun game - very humourous,"Its a good length but I wish it was longer
It was fun - one puzzle I sorta muddled through without really knowing how I solved it. The rest were good.","Nov 26, 2017 at 7:30 PM",5, 2,So glad you had fun! Thanks for the review :-)
2022-05-28 15:47:02.318502,Raikasha,One of the best Games in VR!,"I had the Opportunity to play the game in a beta-stadium (nice new building by the way, guys ;)). 

I hadn´t played in VR since the first beta-test. I was so flashed by this game, that in fact, I just bought my oculus because of this game! Now I have finished my own finished Version.

This game is really amazing! It´s not that immersive. But it´s a great experience and really fun to play! 
The humour is great, the voiceacting is beautyful, the graphics are gorgeous and the story is full of twists and shocking moments. Every step is different from the last one, there wasn´t one moment, where I had to do one thing again. All actions are unique and perfectly embedded.

This game really is a little masterpiece, especially, if you see, just how many people worked on this.

I hope, there will be successor after this, you have to continue this or a new story with a similar style ;) 

All in all, you guys cost me 458€ (450€ for the oculus + 8€ for the game), but it´s worth every penny ;)","Oct 12, 2017 at 3:25 AM",5, 14,"Hi! Thank you so much for your review! We really feel honored and hope your investment was worth it. There are some other cool games on Rift in that genre that we love - for example: ""I expected you die"" is one of our favorites. :)"
2022-05-28 15:47:02.333462,One_Of_A_Kind_,Really fun!,"Its about 1 1/2- 2 hours of story, but thats considering you don't play it again, which you will definitely wanna do. I really enjoyed this game, and for only $7, it was a must buy.","Oct 13, 2017 at 8:26 AM",5, 8,Totally thank you for your review! Appreciated!
2022-05-28 15:47:02.349419,Merenth,Very fun!,"Look at it as an on rails point and click adventure. I loved it!
I'm looking very forward to your next game!","Nov 25, 2017 at 11:09 PM",5, 1,Raddo! We'll keep you posted ;-)
2022-05-28 15:47:02.364380,Jaggy66,Really cool and fun to play,"A cool and funny story that unfolds step by step. It is having you solve puzzles, interact with the elevator to slowly find out what is going on. I wasted a lot of time just playing around with everything possible. Loved to bat the bats. Really fun to play. Worth every penny.","Oct 16, 2017 at 1:08 AM",5, 4,Thank you very much for your review! We love that you love to bat those bad batty bats! Bat'em back!

Devs - You guys deserve some major props for the awesome story telling offered in this experience.

Superb, brilliant, funny and a very original VR experience. If your a fan of Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality style of humor you'll love this.
This was a fun and refreshing change and one you need to experience in VR.
