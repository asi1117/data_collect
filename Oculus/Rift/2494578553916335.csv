2022-05-28 19:16:01.829379,CROOOOW,Payouts incorrect,"Tried playing deuces wild. The developer does realize that 2 deuces and a pair is 4 of a kind right? Game doesn't reconize when more than 1 deuce is in play. I haven't tried the other games yet but I can assume they are likely broken as well.

I'll update review if they can fix this simple issues.

If this game isn't being updated anymore, Oculus should pull it from the store.","Apr 15, 2020 at 10:18 AM",1, 4,
