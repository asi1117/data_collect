The game is very simple, but properly challenging. The monsters are cute but you forget all about that when you see the damage they inflict. Level-ups and equipment upgrades are meaningful. It doesn't appear to make use of your hands in the way that an Action-RPG would, so don't go into this expecting to swing your weapon or hoist your shield. I haven't run into any bugs or glitches at all, so I appreciate the quality and thought put into this. Tried it both standing and sitting, and it's comfortable either way.

I'm looking forward to going back in for more!","Jul 20, 2020 at 3:16 AM",5, 14,
