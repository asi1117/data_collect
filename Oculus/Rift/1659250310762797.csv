2022-05-28 11:34:47.898258,shard master 71,beautiful graphic trash physics.,"the success of in death unchained on the quest shows just what a missed opportunity this game was. Right now if the original game devs would just update the physics to match that of unchained this game would probably get a whole new player base. as it stands you can oniy fire arrows extremely slowly and same with the shard. i routinely score over four million points on unchained with a max score of 5.25 million points and i can barely get out of purg on this version. anyway please update the physics for a better rating,and a whole new player base.",Dec 25 at 3:18 AM,2, 14,

2022-05-28 11:34:47.929175,deadtoall23,"trash physics, broken bow, broken shield",for a $30 game i was hoping for a bit more than then a bow with a seizure and a shield that RNGs when you can block damage or not. The graphics look great and there is diversity in the enemies but the main parts of the game make it unplayable.,Nov 4 at 1:01 PM,1, 20,
2022-05-28 11:34:47.944135,YGBHawk,Really bad,"Not a fun game at all, again another VR game people rate just becasue it's VR. The movement should be free movement not teleport, you have to use the bow or a ""Teleport shard"" that is thrown to be able to move location. The controls are not intuitive for other things either and will take some getting used to. As far as I can tell there is no melee combat, just ranged. You do get a shield to defend against arrows though.

I had high hopes after reading the reviews for this game. But like a lot of other VR games, they get highly rated for just being VR and not for execution of gameplay and mechanics.  The Graphics are okay, but there are much better games out there now that show this game up, and given its failed at movement mechanics in a game where movement is key, the developers have let it become an old feeling game.

2022-05-28 11:34:51.112758,desolation89,My Favourite VR Game,"Playing this since 2018. Got in the Million+ Points Club but only play it for training effects, sometimes with sand vest of 15kg.
I miss a few things wich would make it the perfect experience.
Devs, please make it Multiplayer. One complex and maybe 3vs3 or smth (without time lapse)

Second suggestion. I only like the bow gameplay. 
The left arm is more exhausted after one intense run with aiming and bashing shieldmoves. to make it similar, you should insert one dagger maybe for the right hand, or make the chard be like one.

And maybe more environments with more bosses of cause.
This would be legendary.

I´ve played unchained as well but do not like it except the better graphics. 
Short distance of chard, so right hand is kind of useless in this game. And pulling some specials from faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar behind is such crap.","Jan 28, 2021 at 2:11 PM",5, 32,

2022-05-28 11:34:54.241038,cybernettr,"Unnecessarily repetitive, bugs","This could have been a great game, but poor choices by the developers limit it. Aniken is too hard to defeat and the reward is unnecessarily limited. You are brought into a totally new environment (good) but one that is much harder (bad). Worse, when you die, you return to the same style old environment you started on. This means that 90% of the time you end up playing the same environment, which becomes tiresome.

￼As another reviewer has stated, levels are procedurally generated only in a limited sense: the game draws from a fixed number of building elements which it combines randomly.

Bugs: as I continue to play this game, I am encountering more and more bugs. 1. Sometimes, randomly, when I press the thumbstick sideways, rather than rotating 45° I rotate 180° instead. Disorienting, especially since it is 100% random (and doesn’t happen in other games). 2. As I advance through the game, I increasingly notice the ambient sound cuts off abruptly as I teleport. One time it cut off entirely so I couldn’t hear the enemies coming behind me.￼￼ 3. At 45% progress, in the pit of immolation, knights below me were able to hit me with their hatchet by throwing it at me through the floor! (I also see them standing in the lava, which is fatal to the player.￼)","Jan 13, 2021 at 3:57 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 11:34:54.255998,DocWatts1987,An Amazing Game with a Few Flaws,"After clocking about 10 hours with the game so far, here are my impressions:
PROS:
- Incredibly well realized bow and arrow mechanics, that are easy to pick up but also provide a high skill ceiling
- Using a shield to block arrows or bash enemies is also very well realized, and adds an additional layer of depth to combat
- One of the best Movement Systems I've seen in this type of VR Game
- While there's not a huge variety of enemies, the ones that are in the game are well designed and fill a variety of tactical roles
- Rouge-lite elements keep additional playthroughs interesting by adding additional enemies and weapons throughout the game world as you progress through runs
- Lengthy experience; I could see myself putting dozens of hours into this

CONS
- Positional audio could use some work; when you hear an enemy teleport nearby, it can be hard to pinpoint where exactly they are in relation to you
- The game could use some sort of visual indicator to let you know where incoming damage is coming from; often times you'll take damage from an arrow, and have no idea where it was fired from. This can be doubly frustrating when it leads to you dying on a run.
- Boss design so far leaves something to be desired; instead of designing unique enounters with interesting mechanics, the game adds in artificial difficulty by spawning in mobs of regular enemies to overwhelm you.  Visual design on the bosses is cool at least, shame that the encounters aren't more fun.
- Randomized elements could use some adjustment; some of my success on a run will be dependent on whether the game feels fit to drop arrow upgrades and health pickups or not.
- Inability to Save your progress in the middle of a run, if you want to come back later.

OVERALL THOUGHTS
The good far outweighs the bad here, and anyone loooking for a good rougelike in VR would do well to pick this up.","Nov 18, 2020 at 10:41 PM",4, 5,

-Get stuck in a wall
-Teleport through the wall and be stuck outside the map
-Accidentally teleport into a cage in the pit and be stuck. 

Usually these events always happen in one of the Pits.

I enjoy sitting down in a chair (need a break from stand up games sometimes!) with Oculus Quest Link plugged in my gaming laptop, wandering through the maps trying to get back to Paradise Lost! Sometimes I make it, sometimes I don't.  The key is to know that it's achievement based.  As you progress, you can go through the beginning areas easier and quicker.  Yeah it does feel repetitive some days more than others but I still come back.  
I hope they add more to the game, it's really a winner and has sooooo much more potential.  Could bring in so many more players.  Would love a co-op feature and a friends feature where you could challenge them no matter what level you happen to be.

The deeper shadows and shading in the original Purgs is a cool touch. Kudos. Worthy of 5 stars, but....we are growing weary of the lack of check points or save features. After getting through Purg 3, I still haven't found this mythical portal that allegedly exists somewhere in the first store of Purg One (?)
that alows you to return to the ones you've beaten. It's become ponderous starting over and over, and now with the addition of PL, after dying you have to complete the first run again to return to it. Ok, fine. But Devs, you need to implement a save system of some kind. Something. ANYthing. Our patience is growing membrane thin

Update: Still no save point to return to completed levels, and several times I have been in Anakim's dungeon and gotten stuck in a wall with no way to get out and have to restart!.

2022-05-28 11:35:03.713136,balikbarrow,for hardcore gamers only/technical issue,"I dont recommend this, because of the huge and excessive difficulty, this game was clearly made by harcore gamers for hardcore gamers; dont expect any success without a huge personnal investment and at least 20 hours of play; due to the absence of save and no difficulty setup, its just too hard, and im a gamer for 25 yrs now. The devs should realise that they are not only facing superskilled hardcore gamers but also casuals , kids, ect: its just impossible to show the game to friends to make them try, they get eaten alive and are discouraged-thats customers in less for the studio. This should stay a game, at the moment its more frustrating that fun. This is perfectly symbolised by the pits or the cathedral ridiculously difficults with tons of mobs rushing you.
Moreover there are several technical issues: crashes, huge attacks of lag with screen freeze (great for dying) Why? its the only app doing this on my pc, and as on the official forum its clear that the devs abandonned the project and that there are no patches for 9 months now, dont expect anything from them.
To finish, the total absence of story, background and roleplay quickly limits the game to a shoot them up whith only cleaning and cleaning again more or less the same mazes, to farm endlessly skills: for exemple kill 3000 mobs of the same kind(!!!) 
Its a pity because the visual is exceptionally beautifull, and the musical ambient of the gregorian songs is beautifull too. Buts it's finally very repetitive, it looks like the project of a great game that stopped at the tactic and action level, trying to compensate the vacuity of it by a boosted difficulty.

2022-05-28 11:35:03.744053,TheEpicJoe,Playing for a year - still the best game,"I play this game for hours regularly. Always a good zen like experience. I love to listen to a LitRPG audio book as I murder hordes of baddies. 

Great movement system - I feel like a superhero more than any other game.  Fantastic sense of satisfaction as I get the thumping headshot sound over and over. Great progression as the enemies appear and level up run after run. Always more goals due to the endless in game accomplishments. 

Three suggestions or requests for updates or part 2:
1) I would love it if you could shoot the Axes the knights throw at you. 
2) I would also love a new enemy type that hides in the rafters and drops down on you - some kind of vampire. 
3) I would love for the shard you throw to act as a knife. It could use the same physics as the shield. Maybe it hits a little harder but you cant use it to teleport right after you stab with it. 

Other lesser ideas:
New archer mob that spawn in with advanced arrows. 
Hit yourself with some of the advanced arrows in a harder mode?
Day and night cycles on the levels to change things up - like the boss area.","Oct 1, 2019 at 6:24 AM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 11:35:06.862323,skiverstarlight,Absolutely Addicting with 3 Month Update,"First and foremost this is my first review! As a VR user, I am super picky about games I pay for on the platform since the technology is still so new. This game is in my top 2 favorite VR games right along with ""Dreadhalls"". I have more favorites but these are the two I play more out of all of them.

Firstly, the atmosphere in this game is really really nice! The fact it is proceedurally generated makes this game super replayable! The gameplay can seem repetitive at times because the environment will not seem that much different each time you play. The map you travel on is indeed different every single time you play but the cosmetics of it will remain the same. It is always a castle. However this brings me to my next statement.

There are many complaints I see about the fact you can't save the game. Yes this is true, you cannot save midgame, quit and come back later. Once you start a game, you are committed to survive as long as possible. The game DOES USE a save feature in it's achievement system. The more you play the game, the more content you will unlock. Every. Single. Achivement, has a feature it unlocks, from new enemies, new arrow types, and even new environments (Perhaps, I haven't gotten that far yet)

**UPDATED PORTION AS OF 5/17/19**
I've been playing this game for about 3 months since i bought it and it has become absolutely ADDICTING! I've UNLOCKED SO MUCH CONTENT because of the achievement progression it keeps everything SUPER FRESH and makes you want to keep playing to get further. Difficulty grows as you progress through the achivements. 

Movement is Free Locomotion and Teleportation. The way the bow feels when you're using it is very very fun to handle and feels immersive when firing arrows. It is SO SATISFYING when you hit a headshot and I LOVE seeing the arrows sticking out of where you shot!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and GOOD LUCK! (you might need some of that.)","May 18, 2019 at 11:00 AM",5, 25,

2022-05-28 11:35:06.894238,JohnnyDioxin,Addictive Fun - Especially in Rift S!,"All of the above, in spades! Took advantage of the free weekend and purchased after my first try. At £10.99 it's a steal. I like archery style games (usually survival/horror types) but this is the first time I've had the opportunity in VR, and it is masses of fun. Yes, it can be frustrating - but in a fun way. It is also very painful after a few rounds  if, like me, you have a musculo-skeletal disease. But firstly, set as playing seated and secondly playing in short doses, it is very manageable and again, lots of fun! The turn rate adjustment is a good option, too. I have a lot of VR games - owned my Rift 2 years now - but very few keep me coming back. You can tell the ones that will, and this is most definitely one of them. Even if it was just the same level all the time - for me it's about the archery duel first. The theatre is very well done, great graphics. 
In the tutorial you will have to use a little guesswork, as some things are not fully explained (e.g. exactly how the purchasing process completes), but it isn't too difficult to work out what to do. Also came across two bugs - one where the attacker came through my shield and got stuck there and one where an arrow fired over the ramparts got stuck in the air, as though it had hit something. These only happened once, though and are relatively minor.
Top marks! Price and gameplay are very well matched.

The directional audio is fantastic and the soundtrack can get downright creepy, in the best way possible.  The achievement and unlocks make replayability worthwhile, and once you unlock most everything the high scores keep you coming back.  The save points in between levels were a godsend.  The bow mechanics are the best of any game.  The crossbow, and the necessary change to a more aggressive playstyle, leaves me feeling like Rambo.  The movement system and two teleport methods are perfect.  Being procedurally generated adds a nice fresh feel to each run.

It's more fun to start from the begining and work my way up each section so I can defeat each boss and make achievements to boost my crossbow/bow. There is also a option to quit after each level if I need a break, and that is really good because of that I was able to come back and complete the next section. Overall this game is amazing, the levels are very fun and creative.

2022-05-28 11:35:13.236552,pfwfp,So close to great,"This game has the best bow mechanic of any game I've tried.  The problem, however, isn't the difficulty of the game, but rather a) the different creatures have no interesting tactics, b) you have few interesting tactical options beyond random arrow effects and c) the runs are so long.  It ends up being more tedious than tense.  

The difficulty scaling is odd as well. As you do better, you unlock some relatively minor improvements for future runs, but also increasingly difficult enemies. Now, it's nothing for my first encounter to have multiple of the highest level multi-arrow bow dudes and a couple of black knights.  The net result is instead of feeling like you are making progress, it's the opposite.  Add to that the fact that no matter how far you get in a run, every future run starts at the beginning, you quickly lose the will to continue. 

If this bow mechanic could be used in something more like a true RPG, it would be amazing.  As it is, if there could be some true sense of progress (maybe allowing people to start games after the last defeated boss), and the development of real power - at least for the first level or so - it would be a much more rewarding game.","Mar 25, 2019 at 10:59 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 11:35:13.252019,UglyFish819,Fun little game,"It can be a little repetitive but its actually quite fun . There is no way to save or continue, power ups and extra health is scarce and having to keep starting over from the beginning for sure takes away from the games enjoyment. Still def worth the $20 or so I paid for it.

**UPDATE: The developers have updated the game and it is now one of my favoriate VR games. Boosted my rating to 4 stars. The only thing this game is lacking is a save feature. It is SUPER ANNOYING to have to constantly restart from the beginning after you die, especially since the developers have added a new level. People have been begging for the ability to restart on the second level, but the developers do not care to add this much needed feature.

Also the game does not pause when you take off your headset. Something just about every other game does. Its super annoying to die because you took off our headset to clean your lenses, go to the bathroom, or reposition yourself in your play area .. come on, this game deserves 5 start but leaving out this stuff makes it a 4 star game.","Feb 2, 2019 at 8:51 PM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 11:35:16.339865,PleaseDontHaveKids,"Simple but refined,innovative&accessable","Replayability is top notch, bow mechanics work perfectly, easy to pick up, hard to master.  The sound isn't particularly noticable, just some basic monk type tracks, maybe just one, and basic sound effects.  I like this though, for listening to podcasts and books, other VR games are too dialouge heavy or intense for that.  This has moments of adrenaline, but you can take your time, and be pretty laid back with it, casually picking off enemies from far, far away.  Free motion and a perfect teleportation system.

Could have more depth, a progression system, and maybe multiplayer, but as is, it's worth the money.","Mar 27, 2019 at 6:41 AM",4, 0,

There is a good amount of arrow types/variety, an OK-but-needs-more amount of enemy types, and an extremely lacking number of bosses (2 total).  This game was fun/challenging for a few hours, but it gets repetitive quickly.  There are 2 maps/2 bosses that just repeat on an endless loop, along with an optional side area.  Compared to other rogue-like games, for example Binding of Issac, this game simply lacks content.  I played this before it was even in early access, and was hoping before it came out of EA it would have a *minimum* of 10 different bosses/stages, and 20 of each would be far better.  For the price however, especially on sale, it is still fun for a few runs just because the little that is here is nicely polished.","Mar 17, 2019 at 1:33 PM",3, 0,

I really love the challenges this game brings, I really love fighting my way through hordes of enemies and the different types of arrows are awesome for tackling any given situation.

There's plenty of different types of enemies and the bosses are great too.

Also the best bow mechanics of any VR game I've ever played, simply perfect, I love it when my aim is on point and I get awesome headshots from really far away.

Also the fact that each time you play it never the same level layout thanks to the procedurally generated levels. This helps to make the game feel unique each time you play. I never get bored of playing In Death.","Jan 23, 2019 at 3:56 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 11:35:19.550412,Doodlebugz32,Awesome Game,"I find this game very addicting, the fact that you start out at the begining each time you die was at first a little frustrating, specifically when I got to Paradise Lost the first time and then died right away.
However... the fact that you keep unlocking new ammo, new enemies, new sub-dungeons, etc combined with the randomly generated levels, it doesn't bother me one little bit anymore. In fact I use that time to gather up the most/best arrows I can find to power through the following levels and sub-levels.
I have heard people complain about bugs in the game, but I have not experienced any bugs so far after playing for about 20 hours and 53% completion status.

My only complaints, first I can't challenge my friends unless they are in the same bracket as me, this really upset me and my kids. Secondly that there are only 2 levels (not counting the sub-levels, which are optional). Once you get past Paradise Lost, you go back to the first level on a higher difficulty, then Paradise Lost again on a higher difficulty. My last complaint is in PL the Cupids sometimes spawn directly above my head making them very difficult to find/kill before they shoot a couple arrows into me.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. If your arm gets too sore using the bow and arrow, try using the crossbow after you unlock it. It takes a little bit to relearn how to properly use it but will allow much longer gameplay if you have weak arms.","Jan 4, 2019 at 10:05 PM",5, 6,

It changes and gets more challenging over time as you unlock achievements. The soundtrack is the occasional gregorian chant, which is dope. The controls are versatile, but prevent run-and-gun play, because it is not that type of game. This game punishes you harshly for charging-in blindly, and when you find yourself portalling into in a hellish nightmare world with only 1 health bar left, knowing that a single mistake WILL send you back to the very beginning, it is ADRENALINE CITY!

Headshots are very easy depending on how you hold the bow.  I do it sideways and get it every time.

Just watch out for those darn skeletons.....shoot for the glowing part of the chest.

UPDATE: Ever since the 1.0 The Afterlife Update this game is like bug city.  Here are the ones I have encountered....and on NUMOUROUS other VR computers as well.

1.) You WILL get a Black screen if you manage to kill someone AFTER you die.
2.) Challenge someone and die and you WILL  get a black screen with a hourglass just hanging there.
3.) You will sometimes be teleported into thin air when leaving the ""Store"" chapels
4.) Sometimes when you start the game nothing will happen.  You will just be floating there with nothing around you whatsoever.
5.) Some items float WAY too far up from the ground.
6.) Paradise lost needs more instructions on where to go.  I was stuck in the middle of the level and I could not arrow teleport ANYWHERE....since EVERYTHING was out of range.

This is a promising update but it should have been actually TESTED before it was released.  Because of this I am afraid that I have no choice but to lower the rating from 5 to 3.  Sorry Solfar Studios.....consider this constructive criticism.","Oct 7, 2018 at 10:01 AM",3, 13,"In the first couple of days after the update, our online servers were not behaving, resulting in the behavior you are describing due to random network timeouts.

The bow and various arrows and the almost stealth ability to kill your enemies. However the stealth part doesn't work when you get within a certain distance of enemies.

The only other hit against the game I have is when you die you can't go into the later levels and have to start all over and work your way towards them. This really stinks and takes away from the game. Give me the ability to go past a level I finished and this would easily be a 5 star game.

For 30$, I should not be teleporting into the middle of nowhere.  Let me give you an example: I played for an hour and reached the portal to the boss.  When I went through I died within the first few minutes, which is understandable.  However, I strived to reach it again and again... Playing more and more until I finally reached the portal and threw my teleportation arrow inside, only to notice I was stuck behind a wall, looming to my death underneath me.  Can't teleport out, can't strafe out.  Only option is to RESTART the game..
Two more times this happened.  Now I'm giving up.  30$ gone until the devs fix all these bugs.  While the mechanics and graphics are amazing, this game is also lackluster in the diversity of enemies and scenery (obviously).  You're stuck in the same level with the same scenery and enemies time after time again.

I like that it's an archery game but that you get to move. The move mechanics are natural  to the game and fun to play with. You have the option to move with the thumbstick (took about 5 minutes for me to get use to it), a teleport arrow, and a teleport shard (for short range movement) Each movement option has it's uses.

The game is challenging but rewarding. The game is tough but as you play you get a strong sense of accomplishment as you learn how to deal with different situations. 

Great arrow variety. There are different types of arrows that have different effects and each is fun to play with in different situations. There is some strategy in picking the right arrows for different rooms you might encounter. 

Overall, this game has been among the best in VR that felt like I had a purpose for playing it. I wanted to keep pushing myself and getting better so that I could get more acheivements.","Aug 8, 2018 at 11:24 PM",5, 12,

That said, the first thing you need to do is switch on the free movement beta mode, so you can move through the environment with the thumstick, it just make the game so much more fluid. The arrow mechanics work perfectly in VR and in time you will become an excellent marksman. I think this is where the addictive quality is, as your skills improve you can move through the game much quicker and it's immensely satisfying unloading arrows in rapid succession as you wade through hoards of zombies and knights.

2022-05-28 11:35:54.271887,MasterKaos,"Crazy Fun, Intense Archery Madness","This is now my favorite game on Oculus! Tried it during the free weekend and bought after playing it for just an hour. Really well done game with lots of thrills and chills. It reminds me of a Diablo type of game because the levels seem to be semi-randomly generated and theres lots of stuff lurking around or charging toward you to sling some arrows in to. My arms are burning after spending several hours on the game. It is kind of like an arcade game in the sense that you see how far you can get in the castle/how long you can survive. There are powerful arrows to collect (fire, explosive,etc.) and different levels as well. The graphics are pretty amazing in my opinion and the feel of the bow is one of the best out of the many games that offer archery. This game is challenging and at times puts you in a panic , but its a good kind of panic. SUPPORT AWESOME GAMES AND THEIR MAKERS ON THE RIFT!

2022-05-28 11:35:54.288842,rickjamesia,Fun But Tiring,"It's fun to cautiously pick your battles and decide how to approach enemies, but the runs are not incredibly short and you cannot save at all. I hold my bow fairly high and slightly away from my body, which is actually much more tiring to me than moving my arms a ton in something like Beat Saber. That along with the fact that I don't like being forced to continue a game once I feel done for the session, and we have a game that I'm just not going to put much time into. The one time I almost killed the boss, I had to rest and go read a book twice in the run. 
I've played a lot of roguelikes, and almost all of them, even fairly ""hardcore"" ones let you save your current run, you just must continue the run or abandon it when you come back to the game, and there is no way to go back or recover when you die. You have only the one save. If this game doesn't implement that at some point, I can't really recommend it to anyone. VR is primarily a short burst platform, so forcing longer play sessions than standard games in the genre is bizarre.","Jul 3, 2018 at 8:45 AM",3, 4,

Really was surprised as didnt think it would be as good as it was. I first played it on the free weekend and then ended up buying it. It has sort of a assasins creed virtual reality vibe going which is brilliant. I only give 4 stars as the game is more of an arcade game meaning you go into the dungeon and try to get as far as you can to get a high score. While theres nothing wrong with that at all, I reserve 5 stars for a fully fleshed out game with a an epic story and quest. (But hey it is early access) Apart from that the game is amazing with excellent game mechanics that once you learn just seem to fit and flow perfectly. Locomotion is really good aswell once activated (recommended that you do) in the settings and adds to the game.

One must be very conservative with their health, and therefore, cannot haphazardly rush into every scenario half-cocked. Ammunition options and opponents are plentiful enough that its enjoyable to mix up gameplay strategies. It’s currently one of my favorite games... which is saying a LOT since I absolutely detest teleportation locomation.

You have to master slowing down time with your bow select in order to get far in this game. This game is very similar to dark souls with the exception that you cannot retrieve your items after death. There are some issues I found with this game. The familiar in this game at the time of this review blocks your shots if it's in the way (apparently the dev knows and is going to fix this), and the other thing I noticed is that overclocking your graphics card causes the game to crash at random times. When I removed the overclock on my GTX 1070, I had no issues with crashing. Sometimes the enemies stop moving towards you when you leave the shop area. Despite these minor problems, this game is definity worth the buy. Grapically, it's decent, the audio is very nice, and the gameplay is phenomenal. These enemies are not stupid, which makes it that much more satisfying when you beat them.","Jun 14, 2018 at 9:50 PM",5, 3,

But at the end of the day, there's no story here. There's very little game. It's just endless runs for leaderboard bragging rights. Some gamers are all about that, but I'm not. I could care less about climbing leaderboards. I'm about having fun. And there is some fun to be had here, but this is just mindless endless runs that's best in between games if you ask me. Just too little variety. Holopoint is better for this kind of gameplay. Teleporting and free locomotion feels slow.

2022-05-28 11:36:00.559813,Arupian,FUN game,"It's actually 4.5 stars because I'm having so much fun with this game. I've been saying ""OK. just ONE more go"" for the past 2.5 hours. Haven't done that since SuperHot VR. The machanics of using your bow is tremendously done. Feels very natural, and I feel that if I miss, it's my lousy aim, not the game mechanics. The sound design is also very cool, the ""THUNK"" of a headshot is very satisfying, and the music gives the game a great atmosphere. I also really don't mind the shard-throwing teleporting. I rarely use the arrow teleport, pretty much only to shoot  into towers to go shopping. So, why only 4.5 stars ? I think there's still work to be done. I came across a few, admittedly, very minor irks. For instance, I was in battle with a monk and he decided to teleport closer... well, he teleported ON/IN me. I could see his tunic coming from my body. He couldn't kill me, I couldn't kill him. It was madness. I also had a situation where, I sharded into an area, realised the folly of my ways as it was VERY crowded, sharded my way back out the way I came and heard something behind me. I turned and it was an axe-wielding knight. Who just looked at me. He didn't do anything till I shot him first. These minor things aside, I'm really having a great time with this game. It's ohhh, SO close to being 5 Stars, hopefully when it comes out of early-access, it will be. It has the potential to be a really, really good game.","Jun 18, 2018 at 9:59 AM",4, 2,

Played In Death for a long time without any problem and had an awfull lot of fun. Looks like since a new release or upgrade that I have many problems:

- very often unwanted en unpredictable turn of the view wich causes damage from enemies because of desorientation.

- movement with shard does not work sometimes.

- arrows stop in the air as if they hit an invisible wall.

All these things are very frustrating and make this game unplayable.

1. Shot arrows, no hit, because they got stuck into air!! 
2. I saw the entry of Anakim, used the shard to teleport into it: GOT UNDERGROUND!!!!!!!!!!! I went below the map! WTF!

3. And with the teleport arrow I got inside the lair of Anakim, but........... when I die, the game hung.......... scores are gone......... had to reset the game with Alt-F4.......!

Bought this game with discount after the Free weekend. I love it, but I agree with some people. Levels should vary much more and more various enemies.

Teleporting on roofs are fun, but I don't like the ghosts....... 
I can't hit them, it seems after 4 arrows they don't die!? And 3 of them..... Scares the hell out of me...!

Only shield as defence weapon? No thanks, add a sword to kill them. And I'd rather see the gold in my pocket after I die and not reset to 0..... 

And 2500-3300 for upgrading items? Nope way too expensive. And keep them permanent too, because you have bought them.

I dont get why people complain about things like gold reseting when you die (Its a roque like thats the thing roque like games do) or enemies like ""ghosts"" are unkillable when they clearly just haven't played enough to understand how to defeat them (arrow to the chest).

UPDATE: The bow has pretty much completely been fixed and feels really smooth now. I also have invested a lot more hours to this game. I am starting to think more and more than this game needs to keep your progress when you leave at any point. Having to finish the entire purgatory takes at least 25 minutes. If you add all the different pits (extra stages) and you take your time with killing every enemy it all adds up to about 50 minutes just to be able to quit without losing your progress.

2022-05-28 11:36:06.920577,corporatezombie,Loving this game,"This is a rogue like archery game with a gothic / purgatory / religious / dungeon setting. The graphics are very atmospheric and realistic for a fantasy game. It's beautiful to look at. 

The important things are right here. The archery is very satisfying and rewards skill. Making that long range headshot is very nice and the ""thunk"" it makes when it connects is great positive feedback. The enemies aren't too static to make it too easy, and react nicely to being hit, making you feel like you are really doing something. Not only that there are some interesting power-up arrows that you can unlock and collect as you go through the game. Some add more firepower, others can be used a bit tactically acting as mines and traps.

Movement is a joy. I find using the thrown teleport crystal much faster than the 
teleport arrow, and I recommend using this to get about, unless you fancy those roof top shenannigans I mentioned earlier. I understand there are some free-movement options, but I haven't felt I wanted to use them yet.

You can play the game as a sneaky stealth ninja, or as a full on Legolas teleporting from roof to roof and then close in for that close range face shot. 
Killing multiple enemies in seconds is also possible particularly when zombies are closing in.

Some people have complained that there are limited enemy types, but as you play more the enemies get progressively harder. You'll start to dread seeing that gold clad archer that peppers you with multiple arrows and decimates your health, or that black clad ""the mountain"" soldier who just refuses to go down. Plus maybe they haven't found the portal yet? There are definately new tougher enemies in there, if you are brave enough!

Some of the enemies are genuinely scary. One in particular has me reaching for the toilet paper every single time he jumps me! I don't know what it is about it, but it's like ""leave me alone!"" every time. 
Overall: Highly recommend!","Jun 4, 2018 at 5:57 PM",5, 5,

I think based on aesthetic preference and a strong feeling of nostalgia-- being reminded of Diablo 2 (but getting to be inside it, hell yes!)-- this is my favorite between Robo Recall and Sairento VR, which I consider to each be a gamechanging experiences and amazing in their own right
A lot of reviewers complain about the lack of story, but the story is right in front of you! You're in Purgatory. That's all there is. The subtle atmosphere paints a lively landscape of warefare inside, out and on top of ornate floating churches with incredible architecture.
I love it just the way it is but there are a few constructive suggestions I'd like to note just in case the devs see
1. Any kind of split second animation when your shield switches out from the bow would be awesome and raise the immersion
2. Perhaps an option to switch the gold coins with blood splatters- even if those coin animations were just colored dark red, it'd go a long way for immersion
3. Make the teleporting dagger thing something you can melee with and also jab/toss into enemies' faces for teleporting melee combat
4. This might be more technically difficult but if you freeze an enemy in a video game in 2018 then shoot him with an impactful type arrow THE FROZEN GUY GOTS TO SHATTER! It's just expected...
That said, don't let my suggestions imply that I haven't played this for almost 8 hours already... that's a lot for a fat guy to be performing like Hawkeye or Arrow, whoever you think is sexier. Bye!","Jun 4, 2018 at 7:23 PM",5, 4,

Not because you love the game so much but because if you die, you have to go back to the very begining....ugh.  When I finally got through Purgatory 1 by defeating Anakim the Abominable (on the first try I might add) I entered Purg 2 with a Save point thinking, oh boy, I can now work on progressing through Purg2 now and Purg1 is now behind me. However, this really isnt a SAVE point, its a ""Take a Break"" point. I took advantage and exited out of the game for awhile and when I came back I was able to start at Purg2 but I ended up dying fairly quickly so I thought, no problem, Ill just start back at the begining of Purg2.  Oh no, it sent me all the way back to the very begining of the game.   Sorry devs, I cant keep playing this over and over again. I probanly wont pick this game up again until the devs add a SAVE point or something similar as the game is now way too repetitive because you cant save your progress.  Ive looked at other reviews and Im not the only one to mention this.

On the other hand, its a very beautiful game. The best bow game you'll find and the atmosphere is very creepy. Most of enemies are a challenge and their A.I. isnt too bad.

In Death is an archery game, and it's a very good one.  Dodging, blocking, shooting: pretty much everything you'd expect from a game based on archery combat and for a good price to boot.  It can be a bit spooky at times, and I suppose it can be classified as horror, but it's by no means gory or gratuitous.  In fact, the occasional jump scare really adds to the experience, and it's one of the few games I don't mind dying in.  The learning curve is present, but when I die in the game I don't feel cheated, and I'm quite anxious to get back in and try again.  Not a lot of games do that for me.  My only complaint is the scenery can get pretty repetitive pretty quickly.  It would be nice if there were different locations than “labyrinthine gothic cathedral,” though one thing is worth noting: it IS still in early access.  There’s probably more to come.

I have never been a FPS type. I never had the sensitivity to aim with any accuracy. However, I experience no such issue with In Death. The controls are so intuitive! When I move my arm an eighth of an inch to adjust my aim, it feels natural. I also think it bears saying that the atmosphere is totally unique. I feel like I'm in pergatory, with the indescribable, peaceful music, and Christian murals tastefully arrayed. I feel like I'm in Christian Purgatory and I love it!
 
I was experiencing tracking issues when facing the rear sensor, but mounting sensors on roof fixed this!  I recommend 3 sensors at least. The devs just updated their random map generation and it is GOOD! While it took at least 10 hours, the old map generator started to feel old after a while. They added numerous bug fixes, and exteme pits of doom.

I would add that I almost returned this game because of how terrifying it is at first. Don't do it! This is a better game than you have ever played!

For 20$ this game is a must have. This is one of the few VR games I've actually purchased (I've been playing a lot of the free games that came with the Oculus, along with things like Superhot VR and Payday 2.) I have only played for 2 hours and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. This game is physically demanding but is really enjoyable. My only gripe is the movement mechanics. You can either use the bow and shoot to the spot you want to teleport, or hold the grip button and throw a shard that teleports you to where you want to move. There is a smooth locomotion option but it is extremely slow. like to the point where it's main purpose is probably to just move around corners. I would love for that to be made faster, but at the same time I can see how it would hinder the game. When you get shot towards or an enemy tries to melee you, you're supposed to either dodge or hold the trigger on your non dominant hand (hand you hold the bow in) to bring up a shield and block it. Having smooth locomotion be faster would mean you could just move the joystick and be out of the way. Like moving at times especially when you're moving from one area to the next can be somewhat demanding, more so than usually just shooting down a line of enemies. So something about that just feels off. One annoying bug is that when an enemy archer nocks his arrow, and you try to teleport behind him, he will instantly shoot you, even if he wasn't even turned around himself. The arrow just comes out of his back and pierces you in the face, it's really annoying when even one health bar is so crucial.","Mar 26, 2018 at 5:46 AM",4, 3,

The teleport system works very well, and adding the ability to move with the joystick (via experimental features) is helpful too.

And it never seemed like a learning curve sort of thing either.  I have put enough hours into VR where I don't get sick using locomotion so, like a lot of VR enthusiasts, I usually go straight to settings and turn off teleportation so I can use whatever smooth moving locomotion feature they have.  Which is what I did in this game but luckily the tutorial still forces you to use teleportation and the mechanics are absolultely brilliant.  By the time I got to the actual game I walked around with the ""experimental moving"" option for about 10 seconds before I opted to use the cleverly crafted teleport system.  I've only played this game for about 30 minutes but this is the first time I've EVER played a game in VR where the controls actually felt intuitive enough to react to real time events without much thought and actually come out on top in highly difficult situations.  Plus they include an option to change from seated to standing which is a MUST I believe in any VR title.
       Theres been plenty of good bow and arrow games so they didn't necesarillly reinvent the wheel as far as VR bow shooting goes BUT its as good as the best of them for sure.   And using a procedurally generated rogue like atmosphere  is perfect for VR since I end up replaying a lot of my favorite titles anyway because VR games are so short and great VR games are few and far between.  Now when I come back time and time again it'll be a new experience every time.

Everyone was raving about this, so I bought it, fired it up, and immediately couldn't figure out how to get around or select arrows or defeat a single enemy even with the help they gave. I wondered what all the praise was about as I found it cumbersome and frustrating.

And then...something happened. It all started to click. Next thing I knew, I was leaping on rooftops and across chasms, down hallways, picking off enemies all over the place. Even made it to the boss. I usually don't repeat play VR games that frequently, but this one flows so well when you figure it out, and there's nothing more satisfying than picking off some chump via arrow-to-the-face from 100 yards away in another building. In just two plays it went from ""what the hell is this"" to ""how did I live without this?"" If I had to come up with a couple minor quibbles, it would be the lack of furnishings in the rooms (no chairs, tables, nothing. Who lives in this castle?), and there's usually no reward for exploration; you fight your way to a dead end that's just that - a dead end.

I love the challenge, some complained about it ramping up too fast, but I've loved it. I like the old school games that are a bit rough and tumble and you have to noodle out a solution and try different strategies to be successful.

I do not think the levels are truly procedurally generated. There are 4 or 5 different level 'sections' and a couple sections every run. Which section you run is random, but it chooses from several. The number of qualtiy of bad guys is also random, and so are the finding of good stuff.

2022-05-28 11:36:44.807749,Drelldragon,awsome game,"This is a really good game but has a couple of things that would be good to be looked at and modified for final version.  
Firstly i dont see an option for a new game, so anyone else who wants to play has to play my game which has achievements done so is harder than a fresh start.
Secondly there is no information about what your doing at start, no direction or map or goal point... this led me to wander around shooting stuff, leaving, coming back etc all in purgatory one and opening up quite a few achievements... which has led to problem.
Thirdly, due to all the achieves i have opened up i am facing very hard enemies that with basic bow can take 2 or even 3 head shots to kill.... depending on range shot at.... and i have never got past purgatory 1 and only found the boss once.  I didnt even realise there was a boss intill i had about 5 total hours  played and googled info on game.   
For some sort of progression it would be really good if tiers of mobs were only available in higher purgatory levels....  having to constantly fight groups with only basic arrow consisting of black monks multishot, red monks direct shot, black knight commanders etc   with no additional health bonuses ever achieved....  makes it pretty hard.
I think purgatory 1 should only ever have the basic mobs so unskilled players like me might at least stand a chance of seeing purgatory 2 :)    and the more i play, the more achieves i open up and the harder the game becomes.","Mar 12, 2018 at 5:00 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 11:36:44.825701,Saerain,Most enjoyable VR roguelike so far,"And it helps that archery is intrinsically so much better-suited to motion controls than anything melee. A great design choice from the start to be archery-only, right down to the teleportation method, and aided by the Christian-mythological ""Purgatory"" setting and atmosphere suited to a roguelike, evoking very 12th-century themes of melancholy bow-wielding angels against the somber darkness.

Especially helpful is the variety of enemy behaviors, compared to similar experiences. While the AI is by no means sophisticated, the design here does not allow the player to become complacent. Around the next corner could just as well be a hooded archer that will teleport around as if mocking the player themself, a leaping zombie-ghoul thing that will have you anxiously flinching whenever it draws too close, or a helmeted axe-wielding knight that can simply chop through any of your defenses.

The early access state is most apparent in how objects are generated into the procedural levels, currently often misaligned with the walls they're supposed to be attached to. But thankfully, these are all decorative objects suffering such problems and not anything mechanically significant.

One criticism I would have is of the controls when it comes to interacting with menus, using the trigger to select menu items. This is a problem across VR generally, that some developers use the trigger and others the A button. As usual, my suggestion would be to just use both. Since the A button doesn't do anything else in menus already, why not respond the same way to both.","Mar 16, 2018 at 10:55 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 11:36:44.843653,shaggyskunk,Really good fun,"Theres not much to say that hasnt already been said by others but this game has excellent core mechanics. 
The difficulty curve is perfect and when you get into the rhythm with the bow it is extremely satisfying.
It can be creepy at times in a good way, I really wasnt expecting to get as spooked as I have. I play with the ceiling fan on me and it helps to trick me into believing im in a drafty castle. Every single play I get chills at least once - great job!

A couple of thoughts for the devs (understanding that this is in early access, they're propbably already onto it but i'll mention anyway just in case)

- the locomotion system although functional is a little limiting, It would be great to have a roborecall-esque ability to rotate yourself as you teleport allowing you to face your target more quickly or to look around corners.

- an ability to somehow know where i've already been or where I haven't been, as the corridors can look the same after a while and sometimes i'm not sure if i'm going forward or back

- more variation in environments

- coop would be great

- at times I find the item pickup doent work or isnt exactly clear, it took me a good few hours to realise I didnt actually have to be standing on an item to pick it up.

1. I have a 180 degree setup. If I turn too far, hand tracking gets pretty bad. The current indicators of direction only activate when facing almost entirely the wrong direction. Add some mechanism to determine your direction relative to the sensors at all times (see Robo Recall for a well-done mechanism).
2. Occasionally I am damaged right after I've killed everything I was fighting, but can't detect any enemies. It seems like this is a bug? Kind of frustrating given the importance of even one health.

I'd also love some additional customization or leveling during gameplay. Gear, experience, etc. would be fun.","Mar 12, 2018 at 7:34 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 11:36:54.312218,CharveL68,Best bow game so far,"PROS
- Controls are intuitive
- Graphics are more than adequate
- Randomized every time = replayability
- Incremental advancement including new enemies, weapons, and difficulty
- Not a wave shooter
- Option for free-motion yet can still use teleport when necessary
- Even better gameply with a 3rd sensor and roomscale

CONS
- Only issue I had was some glitching when panic-teleporting out of a close in mob a couple of times, but might also just be, well...panic

CONCLUSION
If you're like me and want to have a go-to bow and arrow game to replace that little mini game in The Lab, look no further.  Not only is it not a stationary wave shooter despite not being open-world, but the map is randomized along with the creatures so each replay is different enough that you have to stay aware.  Additionally the more replays and achievements you receive, the more enemy types and difficulty are there for your playthrough.

It's the game you'll go to when you want something active and enjoyable without having to commit to a long session.  Or perhaps directly after watching a Legolas scene in a Lord Of The Rings movie binge watch.

UPDATE: Game keeps getting better and better, but one thing that  can be fixed is often the enemies spawn in way too close.  Sometimes I'll peek around to an empty courtyard, enter in and POOF!  Surrounded.  Pants filled. xD","Feb 23, 2018 at 12:54 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 11:36:57.515766,SwashBlade,Free movement needs work but still great,"First up: You really can't play this without using the teleportation.  I used a mix of free movement and teleport for one very simple reason: You can go anywhere.  Take to the rooftops to bypass a particularly difficult hallway or just to get a better vantage from which to rain destruction.  Some enemies can also teleport and love to flank you.  The environment is intricately decorated, from the stained glass windows to the statues and bas reliefs there's clearly been a great deal of work go into the detail.  There's a free movement option, though it would benefit from smooth turning and possibly a sprint function - it feels incredibly slow.  The rest of the controls work quite well - aiming and firing an arrow feels as natural as it can without having an actual string to pull.  Blocking incoming fire works well, as does ducking and dodging.  I did have the occasional niggle when trying to throw a teleport shard - the game thought I was trying to fire a teleport arrow instead, so instead of teleporting sideways into cover I teleported forwards into the thick of the enemies.  This is definitely one that's going to be on the Must Have list though.

Update (Feb 21 2018) Movement has been improved massively.  Smooth turning is in as an option and things feel a little faster.  Additionally, throwing a teleport shard can optionally be on the grip instead of the face buttons, making it much easier to throw it when you want.

2022-05-28 11:37:03.877466,davidbollman,,"The graphics are good, but I found that the bow jumped around too much for me to enjoy the game nearly as much as I could if they managed to improve the bow mechanics.  I was fairly careful to be facing the 2 oculus sensors so the tracking IMO should have been a bit better.  I partly blame oculus though as I suspect they lost tracking of a couple of leds on the bow I pulled back; added in some additional sensors (if they dont' have them to the hand sensors) would help with tracking when perhaps they don't see as many lights as they should like when I pull the bow string  into the krook of my neck.  lol my arm also got tired holding the bow :)..   I'd recommend an easy medium etc where your health is different, and a just for fun mode where your health is unlimited.  I also would like a bit better sneek mechanic, as I found that when I peeked around a corner, even if they weren't looking at me they would detect me, even if they weren't looking in my direction.","Feb 4, 2018 at 7:48 AM",4, 2,

game starts off simpley enough but as every unlocked achievment changes the world in some whay the game becomes deeper and hellishly difficult, sneaking around trying to agro as few enemys as possible while hunting treasure and weapons you will need to take down the boss has a distinctly darksouls feel to it, and at $20 you will get dozens of hours if not more out of this gem.","Feb 10, 2018 at 2:38 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 11:37:07.029111,strangebread,A Nice Surprise,"I went into this game not expecting much and was absolutely blown away by it. This is a rogue-like game in which you traverse a procedurally generated dungeon and fight everything with a bow. There's no other game like this on the Rift right now, and it's absolutely fantastic.

The best thing about this game has to be the bow mechanics. The bow feels absolutely fantastic and many of the special arrows feel genuinely powerful. But the best feeling of this game is when you nail that long distance shot, or blast someone right in the head. It's also very tense, and sometimes even a little scary. I've screamed a few times as I've turned at the last minute to see a swordsman swinging right at me, to hurriedly smack him away with my shield. This game can really have incredibly intense moments of action and this is when it's at it's best. The new enemies and items that unlock as you unlock achievements keep the game fresh and constantly developing. Whilst sadly most enemies are based around 3 basic variants, the changing dungeon layout, enemy compositions and random arrow types you'll get will keep you changing approach constantly. One run may be all about the spam as you ricochet arrows around huge rooms. Others you may lay traps on the ground and use careful movement to lure the enemy into your bombs.

The bad comes mostly from the procedural nature of the game. Enemy bowmen are your most dangerous threat by a long way. Their shots are always deadly accurate, and if the game spawns a bunch of them you'll probably die as you constantly need to move to avoid their arrows. Particularly in the boss fight, this is infuriating and can really ruin your game.  When you have a good combination of enemies to keep you on your toes, this game is fantastic. Similarly, you can be screwed over by bad loot drops and health is almost impossible to come by. In spite of it's flaws however, this is a standout unique game and tons of fun. I highly recommend it.","Feb 9, 2018 at 4:28 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 11:37:07.048061,nikolaej,,"This game is honestly amazing. If you're a fan of roguelike and/or roguelite and also a fan of the bow & arrow, get it. I understand it's in early access and will be receiving patches. But, if the devs are listening, please make it a touch easier to string the arrow. So many times have I been in a bind surrounded by enemies that I could've taken care of had my arrow appeared any time that I tried to fire. That issue aside, I'm having so much fun playing it!","Feb 3, 2018 at 4:06 PM",4, 4,

When I came back later that day to continue I had to start over again. This game is probably 8 hours long. Without any saves It's impossible to enjoy it to the fullest.

I was satiated with QuiVR (an excellent title that improves upon the bow using experience), but there is nothing around that will touch In Death as far as atmosphere, ease of use, excellent graphics, replay value and fairly accurate bow feel.   The levels are procedurally generated so you're not doing the same thing every time.   I'm learning from my mistakes on each level and getting better with each pass.  Great looking game, highly recommended.","Feb 4, 2018 at 4:49 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 11:37:13.347353,Gonzaxpain,A surprising discovery,"I was quite skeptical about this, to be honest, but I read the reviews and I said ""what the hell, let's try it, it's 18 euros"" and man, this is soo much fun. I've spent the last three hours playing it and I just couldn't stop. The feeling of having a real bow in your hands is fantastic and doing a headshot with it from a distance is an incredible pleasure. The precision is great, you really feel like it's you making the good and bad shots and also unlike some other bow and arrow games heres you always have the arrow where it has to be, no tracking problems or any of those situations when your arrow appears where it shouldn't be. Don't let the fact that the game is early access put you down, this can be perfectly played as it is and I just can't wait for the developers to add more stuff (hopefully more ambience music, sound to your footsteps, more walking speed and a few other things) but as I said this is great as it is. The fact that the stages are never exactly the same makes it even more fun and avoids repetition so this is very replayable and it will take you a few hours to finish it. A big surprise and one of my favorite games in VR right now.  Go out and buy it, you won't regret it.","Feb 6, 2018 at 4:32 AM",5, 1,

I've learned to pace myself and not rush in guns blazing, as that usually leads to a quick death.  The only issue I have so far is my left shoulder is killing me after playing for a while.  The bow mechanics are about as real as it gets in VR.  Love the character enhancements and arrow upgrades.  I've only made it to the boss fight once and it was freaking amazing.  Of course, I died, but wow!  Fight a video game boss and fighting a VR boss are two entirely different things!  If you're on the fence, buy this game.  It's now on my must have list.","Feb 5, 2018 at 7:57 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 11:37:16.548921,Crumplecorn,Pure good gameplay,"Shoot things with a bow and try to not get shot back. Fry them, electrocute them, gas them, curse them, blow them up, hit them with your shield, teleport around them and make liberal use of bullet time (arrow time?) and roomscale. It won't be enough, you're still gonna die.

As you play the game you unlock achievements, which give you new types of arrows, upgrade your damage/hp, and add new, tougher varations of the enemies to the map. This means the progression that most games go through, where you get better weapons but harder enemies in later levels, is there throughout in later runs. So, you can jump right into the meat of the game straight away every time you play.

If this isn't enough, every time you finish a run of purgatory (3 randomly selected areas, 1 static area, and a boss), you go to the next level of purgatory, which is the same thing but with upgraded enemies. Get to deeper levels of purgatory and you open gates that let you skip directly to them.

Point is, if you want an archery game that you can just pick up and it instantly delivers fun, challenging gameplay with a minimum of fuss, this is it.","Feb 4, 2018 at 12:23 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 11:37:16.567870,Caspersight,Great Fun,"I gave this a go due to the fact that the thought of using a bow and arrow in VR is a good enough reason to try no matter what. I was suprised how much I like the game, it is very additive and has a great feel to the game and the physics are great too, you really feel like shooting a bow. The graphics are pretty good however it would be nice to have a little more music or some more ambient sounds while walking around and in a battle. It is a achievment based game so there isnt what you would call levels however there is plenty of achievments to unlock and recieve new wepons (arrows) I hear that there are boss battles but I didnt get that far. I will play it again for sure. Here is a video I made of the game.

I played the game for 20 minutes without dying and no drop until I died.  Funny part it seems that  the more the game restarts the less drops you have and the stronger the npc are.  At the end I still managed to reach 32% of completing the first part.  The price of  the potions is crazy high, 2500 gold in order to heal  1 point .  It should fully heal you.  So far my problem is the amount of drops and more healing.  It is very hard to finish a game from A to Z without any healing potions   :-)

The bow and arrow combat can take some practice, however once you start learning how to aim, youll be surprised at some of the crazy nice kills you can get from distance. One thing that bothers the hell out of me, is the joystick movement. I feel like I move at a snails pace compared to enemies.

You play the role of a holy archer in this Dark Souls inspired roguelight. There is no story as such as far as I can make out, but I found the questing to be quite enjoyable and fun. Levels are procedurally generated and this gives the game a more strategic element  as you try to work out the best way to approach the enemies. The loot system keeps the hunt for new arrow types & power-ups fresh and interesting. The game does have Full Locomotion but unfortunately the video footage I had of me walking freely in the game was corrupted.","Feb 4, 2018 at 5:16 AM",4, 1,
