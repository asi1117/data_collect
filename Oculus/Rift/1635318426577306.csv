2022-05-28 18:50:29.421022,FunkMasterTess,Stopped working (FIXED!),"After an update, I started getting a message that Big Breezy Boat encountered an error and must close.  Error log reports that ""UnityPlayer.dll caused an Access Violation (blah, blah, blah) in module UnityPlayer.dll at (blah, blah, blah).  The program used to work but now I can't get it to launch.

SOLVED:  Problem was the Citrix Receiver a lot of us are using while remote working these days.  I had to uninstall Citrix to remove the second (virtual) display adapter it added.  (Simply disabling it from Device Manager won't work.)  Voila!  I'm sailing again.  Have to dedicate one computer to games and another for remote work as I understand there are other games that get this error as well.","Aug 16, 2020 at 6:19 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:50:29.435982,Lalle75,It's just so small...,"I really wanted to like the game. Boat, water and sky look great and you get a feeling of being on the boat. But there is nothing to see in the game. 4-5 isles (which look very crappy), a wind coming constantly from north and quests like ""Sail to one of the isles"". When in the middle of the map, you can see everything that's part of the game.
I want to explore, see beaches, maybe villages. But there are only these large-polygoned sandspots. I thought it is like these videos from VR Regatta with larger boats. But it is not. I think, I will request a refund.","Mar 7, 2020 at 5:02 AM",3, 25,
2022-05-28 18:50:29.449945,ScrewLoose,,Great app!  I like apps where I sit in a cool environment and do little or nothing (like at work!) and this is perfect.   You can sail around or just let it go out to sea.  You don't have to know anything about sailing to play.,"Nov 12, 2019 at 9:01 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:50:29.465903,captainmadeinmade,A really good and fantastic reallystic.,I really want to say the develepers really out done them self with this one they do not only have added quest mode wqat provides hoiurs of new gamepl\ay they left the gameplay that was teere tere and even made some adjustments like golf physicsm only they added out the featere that yo can give them feedback with help of the  in game talk feed back thiung you could talk into mayber because i asked to much for this quest5 mode and stuff and they actually added it in realloy thanks develepers and that you are still updating this game is really good of you instead of focusing everything on vr reggatta. only mulktiplayers is best done with freins because there is otherwise never some one oonline.,"Aug 30, 2019 at 9:44 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:50:32.576582,JuicyFruit40,Nice for a relaxing VR experience,I was able to get this for free. Its relaxing enough for a sailing sim in VR. I had no clue what i was doing at first but thats what tutorials are for. Turned out to be simple enough. Finally went in to multiplayer expecting nothing but to my surprise a kid was trying out multiplayer and it gave me a long enough time to realize this would be very fun with people that actually enjoy laid back VR games/sims such as this. Overall i give it 4 stars.,"Jul 5, 2019 at 7:16 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 18:50:32.591543,Sfgeo,"relaxed sailing, basic but a good start","For the price it was a steal I acually play it now and then and it does mellow me out. but there is Zero challange to it.  basic controls and easy to learn.  What I would like to see is and be willing to pay for 
1. Different boats with the ability to change some details.  maybe 1 with the ability to go into the cabin  
2. Options for weather, have a little bad weather near far or on you. Would lightning be asking for to much
3. Options for day cycle length  
4. Wave height settings or set to random
5. Wind gusts 
6. Different locales to sail.
7. Better graphics  

ok there is my wish list for the game.  If anyone can think of anything I haven't, please add to the list.","Apr 12, 2019 at 6:28 AM",4, 29,
2022-05-28 18:50:32.606502,fuloydo,,"For $5 this game is totally worth it. Even if you never play it again after going through the tutorial the ship model you receive as an achievment makes it worth the price.  That said, single player is relaxing but also boring.  Of course, if it weren't boring it wouldn't be relaxing. I have yet to try the multiplayer mode but even if I don't like it the game still gets five stsrs because I now have sailboat.  A very nice sailboat.","Jan 25, 2019 at 12:01 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 18:50:32.621462,JacketPotato,It's okay... Needs VC!,It's a relatively stable game with simple graphics and mechanics. It gets the basic mechanics of sailing down with multiplayer funtionality. Definately needs voice chat!,"Dec 31, 2018 at 6:52 AM",3, 4,"Hey JacketPotato,

Voice chat should actually work. Do you have more then 1 mic connected to your PC? Where you able to hear others?

2022-05-28 18:50:32.636422,nolte-richard,It is very relaxing,I was surprised that sailing can be so beautiful. There are small islands that are even decorated. I like it.,"Nov 6, 2018 at 3:20 PM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 18:50:35.722170,SillSarayK3,Cool game for the price,"This is the second game I've purchased, pretty neat.","Feb 25, 2019 at 3:41 AM",4, 5,
