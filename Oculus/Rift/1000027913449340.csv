I assumed arcade action meant fast paced not silly standing in one place simulator 2019 or whatever","Jan 18, 2020 at 4:24 PM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 17:07:10.241066,Mesyc,Really nice... and perfectable !,"A really nice and yet really perfectable arcade style shooter. It could be easily much better with few tweaks. I bought it for 4.99 and at this price, you can go eyes closed ;)","Jan 18, 2020 at 1:17 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 17:07:10.256026,kamaracso,Really good for the price.,"I thought it was just a fine game but when the monsters come the game changes completely. It's a bit short btw.

For devs: the scale is a bit wrong. I'm 1,90 and even the woman is taller than me. The settings on my headset are ok, is just this game.
Thanks","Jan 19, 2020 at 5:00 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:07:10.269988,SorenMC,,"TL;DR: decent game, but standard early access game that doesn't look like it's going anywhere?

While the game game seems quite nice so far, remember that it's an early access game (which is mentioned here, but not on steam?)
Came out in 2017, last update from what I can see in my update history, is 4 months ago.
Last reviews with comments are nearly a year old at this point...

Don't expect the game to be finished any time soon, and that's assuming that it'll happen. You can get about 45 minutes out of the initial game though (disregarding the training stuff, and not doing the same missions over and over, but on higher difficulties)","Oct 14, 2018 at 9:08 PM",2, 31,
