2022-05-28 15:12:17.533512,TsaberX,Interesting start...,"The is the first part of the story - you are trying to find a missing loved one.
There was a demo but that seems to play from part two.  This is really more background.  Not a bad start but the second part is more involved. 

Visuals 4 - for the time it release I though it was pretty good
Sound 3 - the ambient sound quality is pretty good but there some nose cancel issues that kind of make you lose the emersion
voice acting 5 - you get this from cassette tapes and flashbacks
Replay ability 3 - pretty linear
controller 4 - pretty standard movement so nothing too complicated
Over all emersion 3 - It was ok and the story was a good start",Jan 25 at 8:24 AM,3, 1,

2022-05-28 15:12:17.563432,Golan-Trevize,Subtittles please. At least in english.,"Many of us are not english natives. I don´t know how good is the story. I don´t understand a word. There are other gamaes where i can  do it, but this is not one of them. 

In other order of things,  some of us dislike the teletransportation. It would be a goog idea to add the free movement option.  The game works OK for me. The graphics are good enough and  it haves a very inmersive atmosphere.  

By now, i give 3 stars. If the devs adds subtittles, i will give four.  With free movement, it will be a five stars game for me. 

The game remembers me to Red Matter. As the Verticval Robots team are spanish like me, i understood the story.  So, i gave them the five stars. You may be thinking that Red Matter has no free movement. It´s true, but they have not only subtittles in spanish, there is audio in this languague too.

I bought both games by 23€ It´s a very good price, i think.","May 17, 2021 at 5:41 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:12:17.578392,iron_tonic,Not much of a puzzler,"This is a decently good game with a solid interface.  However, I found it lacking in the puzzle/problem solving department.  One of the best parts of a puzzle/escape/problem solving level-based game is learning the rules of the world you’re in and how problems should be worked through.  Yet in The Gallery there is some serious inconsistency in this area.  Sometimes the things you need to focus on are clearly outlined, other times they are so embedded in the backdrop of the game that it’s nearly impossible to figure out what you’re supposed to be doing.  Sometimes the notes, objects, writing on walls, and tapes lead you towards the answer; other times they don’t really provide any helpful clues.  And a lot of the gameplay is just wandering around trying to find your way to the few action areas on that level; it’s easy to get lost and take dead ends which is frustrating.  Three stars for a storyline and some nice level design, but if you’re looking for lots of interactivity this is not the game for you.","Aug 31, 2020 at 12:36 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:12:17.592355,calcatron,Too buggy to play.,"Game is buggy and freezes up.  I've never played the game, only ever done the tutorial over and over and the breathy female voice giving words of encouragement gets pretty annoying if you listen to it for long enough.  

Tutorial is needlessly long and there is no way to skip it.  I accidently selected the wrong option and had to repeat the tutorial, but one of the bottles failed to break and rolled around on the floor where I can't reach it and I got stuck in the tutorial.  The only times I got past the tutorial, the game froze up so I've never played it.  

Unfortunately I waited more than 14 days to request a refund so I'm stuck with a game I've given up trying to get to work.","Apr 9, 2020 at 7:54 PM",1, 5,
