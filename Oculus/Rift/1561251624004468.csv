Things to add, when you are searching things for the police add the possibility to walk by moving your arms,/controllers.

Make it possible to always work behind the counter so you can speed up work, i really liked working behind the counter but i dont get it often, if you make it a feature that you can do when ever you want it would be nice and make it that the game doesnt get boring!!

Also the balloon shooting is glitchy with tracking on the Rift S","Jun 25, 2019 at 2:23 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:40:22.392168,Ryan1599,Amazing game but needs a help button,"I LOVE the game but I have no clue how to get to the mini games, so I looked in the menu but there isn’t a help button or a way to find out.","Jun 17, 2019 at 2:56 AM",4, 7,"Thank you for your review! I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble figuring out how to play the mini games. Your suggestion for a help option in the menu is fantastic, but in the mean time I'll explain how it works. As you interact with your Mall you'll gain Popularity (the blue hearts) which will fill your Popularity bar. When it's filled you'll gain a Popularity Token which can be use to play the mini games. Just highlight your token count and you'll see the button prompt to start a game. Hope that helps!"
