The free trial is so limited in functionality you can hardly use it for educational purposes and sorry, I can't afford 89$ a month  as a student for some software. You could compare it with YouTube saying 'Come and watch great content, but if you want to upload your own movies you have to pay.'  I hate it when companies trick you this way, and that's why I'am giving only 1 star.","Jan 12, 2019 at 8:28 AM",1, 26,
