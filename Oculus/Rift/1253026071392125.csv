2022-05-28 19:50:53.188587,lillybaeum,Neat but too slight,Vaguely interesting but way too slight to be anything worth recommending. About 4-7 minutes of content. I know this section is meant for experiments but it really doesn't hook me into wanting more.,"Dec 5, 2016 at 3:20 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:50:53.203054,neuro27,Recommended Experience,"Each page, each comic scene can be viewed from a number of angles and you can even lean into them and look around, like some weird sci-fi movie scene. Sometimes you have to duck, others you have to lean over and in to see the whole image, but others you can just sit and look at.

With some nice hand drawn characters and pretty impressive visuals this is a game that looks great and also brings something new to the VR table. Using the Oculus Remote you navigate around, looking at the next scene or selecting an item or making a choice. I can only imagine that there would be hundreds of choices in the future, but for now, it is only one. Personally, I am not a fan of the art style, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it.","May 21, 2017 at 12:11 AM",4, 1,
