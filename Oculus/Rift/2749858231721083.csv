2022-05-28 18:34:32.268064,robertsca,Eh,After finishing all the chapters and unlocking all weapons I can safely say that this game was kinda bad. Not enough freedom of choice,Apr 28 at 8:59 AM,3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:34:32.284021,Zereoto,FIX!!!,I think the combat update was fine but when you stick a knife in a zombies head it has a timer then you can pull it out not like in S&S where you have to yank it out. I liked the old version better. Fix please,Aug 19 at 11:06 PM,2, 24,
2022-05-28 18:34:32.298981,rjt2000_Rain,I find it enjoyable,"With the recent update on the game, I’d say it is a good game nowadays. It’s not like saints and sinners, kind of reminds me of Arizona Sunshine but better. I like the game and the story, it’s fun and I’m glad that ranged weapons are useful now and they’ve balanced it out more. They even used Eugene’s actual voice for it.",Jul 19 at 3:07 AM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:34:32.314940,ScentlessApprentice,Funish,"Playing the game is fun but it gets boring quick, I like playing as Daryl and the characters from twd, but the mechanics of the game are not good compared to saints and sinners, the only fun thing about this game is the story but you rarely even do story.",Jul 12 at 9:19 AM,3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:34:32.329908,ThatDonutGuy,I'm Having Fun,"First, the melee combat definitely takes a little time to get used to. I've almost completed all of the campaign chapters and I've been having a lot of fun with it. The story itself is interesting and more so if you're a fan of the series. Don't get me wrong, it's far from Saints and Sinners in overall quality, but as long as you don't go into it expecting a similar experience to S&S you should have a decent time with it.","Jun 11, 2021 at 11:52 AM",4, 13,
2022-05-28 18:34:35.437587,cav800,Not an enjoyable experience,"Three things absolutely RUINED this game for me:

1. The constant red fog that pushes you along in a certain direction that will kill you if you remain in it for too long, which discourages exploration and keeps you rushing. 

2. On-screen prompts warning you not to go a certain way. 
3. The fact that you must keep replaying the same scavaging levels over and over in order to upgrade and unlock story levels. 

Other aspects of this game that are not good are the washed out brown low-res graphics, constantly running out of ammo and being forced to use knives, limited interaction, and the gameplay seeming to get more dull the more you play. Didn't really enjoy my time spent with this game.","Apr 16, 2021 at 11:54 PM",2, 36,
2022-05-28 18:34:35.452547,SpacePirate1221,Nothing in this game is done well,"The whole game is just mediocre ideas, bad excecution.  The combat isn't challenging in any way, the only thing that makes combat even remotely difficult is how bad it is. Making it take two or three shots in the head to kill a zombie instead of just making it hard to actually shoot them. Or when you stab one in the head you then have to stand there for a full two seconds before you can do anything else. The hoard is just red fog with 2D zombie textures on it.","May 20, 2021 at 9:12 AM",2, 1,

The gameplay is quite stimulating, and the encounters with the walkers are really good.It's quite immersive to make your way through them and watch your back constantly while you're out scavenging food and medicine.Make sure you always have an emergency exit when you go indoors because using a firearm does attract nearby walkers.I only took one star because the motion system is a bit clunky (even teleport) and sometimes punching a walker in the face when your knife is stuck in their skull doesn't really work.","Mar 5, 2021 at 8:39 AM",4, 9,

They do have a bit too many zombies and thinking which made me a bit disappointed just because there normally wouldn’t be that many unless you start making loud sounds. But I do get that it’s the challenge for that game. The features/things that you can do are limited to what I was expecting. Killing the walkers is the fun part for me.

PROS:
Decent shooter 
Stab zombies

CONS:

2022-05-28 18:34:41.803560,OpticCrown,Not Ready For Release,"im only giving this 1 star becuase theres a ton of issues and dump mechanics

-Walkers should die with ONE shot to the head, not 4 mags.
-The Running Speed is too slow i feel like im moving slower then the walkers.
-Ammo is not enough especially with the 3 round burst glock
-all four characters dont have their signature weapons and magically find their way into a big military crate.
-One of the devs said that guns are supposed to be as realistic to the walking dead show but thats a lie. if you shoot someone in the head in real life they instantly die. maybe walkers have rotten bullet proof skulls?
-The Machete cant kill the walkers with riot helmets, i cant stab them from the chin and up but it only goes through their neck.
-The starting pistol doesnt do anything and it doesnt feel like im shooting a real gun, it feels like im shooting a nerf gun with recoil.
-The 1911 45acp was better then the M9 but it seems less 45 cal but more 0.1 cal
-There should be a mode for practice shooting all of the weapons in the game 
-The game feels half assed and rushed because there is no healing like saints and sinners and hell the weapons took a walker out with one shot and those guns arnt as good looking and correct sizes as the ones in this game. i also feel like guns are completely useless and the machete and butcher knife or cleaver  and the hatchet are the only weapons that work.
-Blunted weapons like hammers and wrenches and tools dont do anything to walkers besides make them take 2 steps back.

Clearly this game isnt ready to be a full release so make it early access and make major updates every single month along with dlc and give the exclusive content for free because this game shouldnt be worth more then $10. Walking Dead Saints & Sinners VR is decades ahead of this game. I know the game just came out yesterday (its 1:04 AM 09/30/2020 for me rn) but seriously this shouldnt be called a walking dead game if it feels like arcade shooters like arizona sunshine.","Sep 30, 2020 at 1:06 PM",1, 100,
2022-05-28 18:34:41.818520,Glitch Fandango,It's just really not that good,"Onslaught, unlike S&S is not one of the all time greats. Onslaught is actually pretty bad and I DO NOT recommend that you buy it. But for some reason I still kinda find it fun to play. Weird. 

I realise that Onslaught is going for more of an arcade vibe, and that's fine by me because that's my preferred style, but it literally does nothing well. The story isn’t great, the voice acting is only ok and the lack of interactions would make a 2016 VR game blush in embarrasment. The music and graphics are servicable at best, but all of that could probably been ignored if it wasn't for a few things...

WHY CAN I NOT USE MY LEFT HAND TO HOLD A F*%KING WEAPON?!?! I really, really don't understand why they didn't allow you to dual wield. A knife in one hand and a gun in the other and the game would be 1000 times better with just that improvement alone.

WHY IS THE HERD A RED FOG AND NOT AN ACTUAL HERD OF F*%KING ZOMBIES?!?! Honestly, I really enjoy the way the ever encroaching horde forces you to play quickly through the scavenger missions. If the threat of imminant death was an actual herd that you had no chance of beating, but could at least go down swinging then again, these levels would have actually been really cool.

WHY DON'T HEADSHOTS F*%KING KILL THE ZOMBIES?!?! There is absolutely no benefit to using the guns in this game at all. You are much better to just wander around with the starting knife, with your arm stretched out and just stroll into the walkers whose heads seem to offer the same resistance as a block of half melted butter.

EDIT: The update has really improved the game. I still think it’s a 3 star (3.5 maybe) game, but for some reason I can’t stop playing it. I’ve actually played it twice as long as I did S&S now, and I don’t know why.","Nov 4, 2020 at 9:28 PM",3, 19,
2022-05-28 18:34:41.833480,xeno3d,Decent,"I'm only a couple of levels in but so far it's decent.  

I REALLY wish they had gotten all the real actors to voice their characters in game.  This would have bumped it up a notch for me.

Walkers need to die with with one gunshot to the head, just like in the show.

Controls seem a bit off but once you get used to them they are fine. Whats wierd is grabbing weapons with your left hand but they appear in your right hand breaking immersion.

I hope the devs keep on updating this game and maybe some DLC?  Negan maybe?","Oct 1, 2020 at 9:49 AM",4, 41,

And very disappointed 
1 it was very quick to finish 
2 TWD S&S 100 time better more story
3 used a knife all way thro only used guns on last level 
4 killing zombies was rubbish and same same after a while 
5 made u grind to get more levels
6 not worth money 

Loved Saints and sinners this takes it one step further By playing with TWD characters only done first 2 levels but very happy so far 

I pre ordered and still haven’t go my founders gold sword or knife maybe need to level up more  

It’s a shame they didn’t use all real actors voices but it would have pushed game price up I guess 

I will return after I’ve got my teeth into it and write more

2022-05-28 18:34:44.929200,loyno_psych,Saints and Sinners is better...,"In nearly all aspects, Saints and Sinners is the better game.  If you want to play a game where the graphics are top notch and the physics are realistic, buy Saints and Sinners.  Onslaught is literally half the game Saints is.

Killing zombies in Onslaught isn't realistic at all.  Saints is able to make you feel as if you are actually battling zombies with the haptics they applied.  Onslaught barely has any true physical feel of combat.

This begs to question why the same engine was not used to build Onslaught.  They had the programming down in Saints.  Why not port the quality of Saints over to Onslaught with a unique storyline.

Onslaught is a total disappointment when compared to Saints.  I was expecting the same quality.","Sep 30, 2020 at 9:44 AM",2, 34,

2022-05-28 18:34:44.959120,TheBrightSide,Did not like it.,"After playing through Saints and Sinners three times and loving every one, I was so looking forward to Onslaught. I was very disapointed. 

The user interface was not well made for VR, its not intuitive and down right awkward. Why make the characters with holsters if you can't use it? Why do you have to grab everything with the left hand even though it holds weapons with the right hand? 

Oh and the environment looks like it was the same graphic technology as Skyrim from a decade ago, in fact, I don't think the envrionment was as good as the VR version of Skyrim. 

The rolling horde wall was a cheap way to dodge making real game play. 

The story line, character development and narratives were pretty bad too. This game had no suspension of disbelief, there was just too many obstacles to buy into the story.

I love a good VR game, and I'm so disapointed that this game wasn't one because I loved Saints and Sinners. I would ask for a refund but I'm hoping they push updates that fixes some of this stuff.","Oct 1, 2020 at 7:28 AM",1, 7,

(i pre-ordered my game but still dont have my weapons)
This game is great ..sometimes

It has some flaws like the faces , they look like a todler has draw it on them.
Then the voice acting. Hiring the real actors would be to expensive , but.... now sometimes its sounds really boring.
But thats all the negative things i have to say.

The game itself is really beautifull , top graphics , slicing up a zombie with ur knife feels really satisfying! 
Ppl complaining about the knife is ""overpowered""? 
Some other ppl will really like that , i do use the knife to cut everyone i encounter.
Im only been in Main Street for supplies but this game has it.
Dont get fooled by those negative reviews bcs in my opinion ..... 70% of them are fake.
It has been a long time since Oculus put such a good game in store again and it was about time.
Recommended? 101% yes!

Update : always doing the same scavenger hunt over and over  is boring


Update Update 3/10 : the longer i play the more i notice the devs need some more work on this one , its getting boring , why do we need to search all over the same place so many times? after 4 times scavenging main street ill quit. Only Daryll story's are somehow still intressting.gonna try the new 10$ weapons update.","Oct 3, 2020 at 11:43 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:34:44.990037,RichKid225,Disappointing Game,"The other reviews of this game are fairly accurate.  I bought this game expecting another Walking Dead Saints & Sinners, but I was very mistaken.  It was nice being able to alter and base/weapons a little bit, but other than that, it was depressing.  The combat was overly simplified and not exciting at all.  The scavenging missions were basically timed and increasing the difficulty basically only speeds up the time frame you have to gather supplies.  

Overall, it was a let down of a game and I would have not gotten it if I knew it wasn't going to be another Walking Dead Saints & Sinners.","Oct 11, 2020 at 3:34 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:34:48.089746,CrazyJesse,Negative reviews misleading,"I have a hard time imagining hardcore TWD fans not liking this game. The voice actors are great, Rick's voice actor in particular is a great laugh, I can't decide yet if he's imitating Andrew Lincoln or Keanu Reeves. And then having some of our favorite characters voiced by the actors themselves is a treat. Arizona Sunshine, though it goes on sale for cheaper, is still the more expensive game, and Onslaught is miles ahead of that game. Negative reviews are misguided.

Update: After reading many reviews some things need addressed.

Guns can be upgraded people, please stop complaining that the lowest level un-upgraded weapon is not powerful enough. Have you ever played an arcade style game? ever?

And please please stop comparing this to other games like S&S, Half-life and Boneworks. I'm sorry that you can't pick up useless items and play with them, but some of us don't care if you can carry a toy monkey around for no apparent reason. If you want to compare it to another game, try Arizona Sunshine which is nowhere near as good as this game.","Oct 2, 2020 at 10:04 PM",5, 11,

It's not the game I expected after the advertisement. You don't get any open world feeling and in the end it's only beating up some zombies with melee weapons (because when you use firearms you'll don't have any chance)  So I'm really dissapointet about that game.

-Ok, the Campaign is  nice so far, but only 7 chapters??? ... even the story has no end...
-Very few ""scavenging-missions"", looking nearly the same each.  
-Building up Alexandria is ridiculous and youre not able to walk around.

2022-05-28 18:34:51.261264,imwhitedynamite,Not Good,"This game was obviously rushed out the door. I dont know if COVID-19 played a part in the fact this game is REALLY unpolished but never the less it is. The controls are not good. They feel clunky and janky as hell. How is this possible when Saints and Sinners already had code that was lightyears ahead of this. This honestly felt like playing a VR game from VR's early days. The graphics are uninpressive. I think when creators make games that can be run on the Quest alone they have to dial them back so much that Rift S users like me who are connecting their headset to a $5,000 PC with a 2080 Ti just will not enjoy it. It looks like Skyrim or Fallout 3 era graphics. But the graphics I can ignore if the gameplay is solid......too bad for us it's not. The weapons have no weight, swinging a huge heavy wrench in this game is exactly like flailing your sword around in Skyrim, it feels horrible. You cant interact with about 99% of the set pieces and surroundings. You cant really explore anywhere off the very linear line. You cant explore and interact with your base. This game feels like its literally half baked. I dont even think patches can save it. I plan on returning it, its that bad. What a huge disappointment.","Oct 2, 2020 at 10:22 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:34:51.276224,honor_47,"It has issues, but for 30$ I enjoyed it","If the game would have price 50 or 60$ I would give it 3 stars. For 30$ it's pretty ok for me.

Pros:
- I like graphics more than Saints and Sinners - I hate ""cartoon style"" graphics
- Models of zombies and their deads are very nice
- UI of game is well done
- Game keeps you under ""stress""
- Zombie models does not feel repetetive that much as in other games (for example in Arizona sunshine, you see ""same"" zombies everywhere.
- You have your favourite characters from AMC series
- Armored zombies are pretty cool

Cons:
- Shooting weapons does not kill zombies on headshot. You have to repeat headshot many times. What the hell man.... even strongest gun does not. Only one shooting weapon which kills with headshot is crossbow...
- Basically all scavenging levels does have same map scheme. You play new mission in new sector, but you think ""hey, I know this backyard"" and you actually do. Even different missions has very same maps.
- I'm not satisfied with how slashing weapons work. Firearm axe is much better than katana. Hell, why? Machette useless. Boxing knife is worse than army knife due that you can not change how your character hold it. etc.
- Story is not that good as I expected and it has opened ending...
- It's much more arcade game than survivor
- Even hardest difficulty is pretty easy. I finished in on hard and I died just 2 times. And it wasn't even in the (hardest) game ending. Hardest difficulty should be at least ""hard but playable"" but not that easy.","Oct 5, 2020 at 12:08 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:34:51.293178,Zompacalypse,"Best Zombie Game, Period.","This game is also absolutely epic. PLEASE, don’t base your judgement off the bad reviews, especially if you’re a zombie or TWD show fan. 

However, this game is not perfect. One thing I need added is a smooth turning speed adjustment. Right now it is just too slow to turn, but definitely workable when combined with real turning. I hope they add coop! It would be really fun scavenging with friends and sharing the supplies. Also, walking around more of Alexandria and interacting with the buildings we make would be awesome. I also wish more of the environment was physics based like all of HL:A, but it doesn’t really make a difference in the actual gameplay, so I understand why it could be left out. 

The melee and gun mechanics combined make this the best VR zombie game, possibly best zombie game ever considering the actual interaction with zombies. In this game, walkers don’t really die until you puncture their skull a few inches into the brain. This means they will keep coming until you kill them properly, which is just like the show and is super cool. Next, you can shrug them off just by moving your hands into them or holding a button for a harder punch. If you slice at their arms, they will come off with awesome detail. If you repeatedly stab their chest, mouth, or anywhere really, a detailed hole will form. The weapons aren’t made to weigh like real life, so it feels more like Arizona Sunshine and that is much preferred when fighting off massive hordes. You can switch from melee to guns instantly with 4 weapons to choose from at a time, and a ton of options in total. The hardest difficulty feels like Resident Evil games where the zombies don’t die in one headshot. At first I didn’t like it, but when I realized this was the same strategy as RE, it made sense, especially when you get a lot more powerful guns than just a pistol. 

The lack of artificial stamina is amazing. Instead, you get 4 times the zombies than S&S, and get tired just from the epic hordes. Weapons don’t break, so that’s not a useless, unrealistic worry. The gun physics are not hyper realistic, but they are close enough and actually simplify it while keeping enough of the interaction to make it a perfect blend of fun and realistic. The gun range is really fun and works great as a practice/prep zone. 

I think the graphics are really nice, especially the zombies. There are a ton of different types and they are all super detailed. The environment is really nice also. Not to mention, the STORY is great! This picks off from the show right after they defeat The Saviors, which means new interactive content for a great show. The way they tie into the story as rebuilding Alexandria like a State of Decay type base building game and then also get a personal Daryl story is awesome as a TWD fan. 

I highly recommend this game, it’s incredibly fun and mind blowing as a long time zombie gamer.

The graphics are ok, the storyline is pretty dull, and You can't interact with your environment. Such as opening a fridge, picking up items on a counter etc. The evac missions to earn supplies and civilians are pretty cool. I am not a fan of the physics in this game. The zombies feel really lite and flimsey. Like when you slap one in the face they kinda just spaz around in an unrealistic way. TWD Saints and Sinners did a great job giving the Zombies weight and making weapons and people feel heavy. THIS GAME NEEDS MAJOR WORK!!","Oct 13, 2020 at 4:25 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:34:54.419816,DFoot,lazy cash grab,"what is the point of a vr game where your hands mean nothing?

pressing a button and having items magically appear in THE OPPOSITE HAND is a complete joke ( i actually laughed in dissapointment and amazment the first time i picked something up because of how rediculous these hand mechanics actually are )

There is also almost no concept of wieght in this game. you can grab a 3-4 ft long pipe wrench and swing it around like you have nothing in your hand, then on top of this you can play golf with dead zombies and yeet them as far as you want on the ground but things like water bottles and plates and other objects in the world are just painted on basically, you cannot interact with anything in the enviroment unless its specifically for the story. 

Graphics are also a complete dissapointment, Compared to what we you would expect from a game immitating a show.
Take Normal Reedus for example, look at death stranding norman reedus (on ps4 not PC) then have a look at darryl in this game.  
see what i mean?

There is no stamina and the mele combat is op and you're also able to pick stuff up fast, but people don't understand that it's intentionall... It's a fast paced game and you're supposed to grab a lot of loot as fast as possible and get back to base while you're being chased by a horde while finding new weapons etc.

 People are complaining about pistols taking 3 shots to the head, still that's intentionall... If you had a pistol that could one shot all the walkers in the start what would be the point, the point of this game is to find loot and upgrade your base and your weapons lol not have one shot item at the start, so you actually have to rely more on mele, at the start which i enjoyed at least.

The story missions are great as you follow daryl after he got lost and there is no timer and you can explore the lore and everything else at your own paste. I actually really enjoyed it and i really do think you should buy it, i gaurante it gets more fun as the game goes on!

2022-05-28 18:35:00.753874,usaokay,A really good 2016 game.,"Game adaptations of AMC's The Walking Dead seem to have trouble trying to match the series' tone. Oppose to games set within the comic book's world, the TV show's adaptations have narrative dissonance through gameplay. The series is all about survival and exploring the worse of humanity when they're pushed into a corner. In TWD: Onslaught, it's as if someone absorbed the basics of the series through pop culture osmosis and made a game around it. The narrative is incredivly light as the focus is on the action. The latter of which is more so that this can easily be without the TWD license and I wouldn't compare it to the franchise.

There is no greater sense of danger or tension as your knife can one-hit kill zombies faster than headshots with a pistol. There is no stamina meter, no weapon degration, and while there is limited ammo, running around stabbing the infected with a knife just feels like I could single-handedly stop the apocalypse.

There is a gamey element of unlocking stronger perks as you gather materials to upgrade your settlement. It's the game's way of ""leveling up"" along with finding new weapons. However thanks to the rise of other games that offer more interactivity (see: Half-Life Alyx and TWD Saints & Sinners) with picking up items, you point to the item and it automatically moves into your inventory.

The arcadey element is an okay gameplay feature, but if you're a TWD fan expecting a great narrative and invigorating gameplay, look somewhere else. If you just want to shoot zombies in arcadey environments with some ""gamey"" features, there are slightly better games out there for you.","Oct 7, 2020 at 9:37 PM",2, 1,

The weapons are stuck to your hand and there is a weapon wheel instead of a realistic weapon storage system. The game reloads for you and you don't even feel like you are doing anything. The looting system just requires you to point your hand at an item and it flies to you. Weapons have no weight to them at all which takes you out of the immersion. If you are looking for a good, immersive walking dead experience, purchase saints and sinners.","Oct 6, 2020 at 9:46 PM",2, 1,

Guns feel weak and clunky (and mechanically bare little resemblance to their real-world counterparts), melee weapons range from wildly uncontrollable to only usable in one motion, and over-all killing zombies just isn’t fun. If you want to grab a zombie with your left hand and gently tap it on the forehead over and over then you might be able to forgive the combat for what seems like a cool upgrade mechanic but with a Walking Dead game already on the market that is superior in every way I don’t really see why this game needs to exist.","Oct 3, 2020 at 9:16 AM",1, 1,

For starters a head shot should be instant for  weapons like blades, guns, and heavy enough melee (ie. The extra large wrench at the start).
The picking up of items is a little awkward but manageable.
The hoard wave should be a little more realistic, to explain, it seems wrong that you would lose health being close to the herd without actually being hit by the walkers. The red field effect is ok for reference, but it shouldn't hurt you through a wall or building when the walkers aren't even in line of site to you.  Not to mention that you start with the herd already close to you, practically forcing you to skip anything at the very start of the mission just so you have time to stay ahead of them.  
Maybe its just my experience with the game so far so I would leave it to your own judgment. 
At least the weapons don't break after one or a few uses...","Oct 3, 2020 at 4:32 AM",2, 1,

I am a TWD fan and I really like Saints and Sinners, and still I am enjoying this game. I am about 3 hours of gameplay in so probably about halfway through it. Firstly, it's an arcade game, not what we are used to in recent VR games, so it does feel a step back compared to other new games. The story is ok, it is a bit like an episode of TWD that you get to take part in. The crafting part is woven into the story mode in a way to extend the gameplay (and games length). It is too easy, but I have played worst games. However, with it being set in the Walking Dead universe with familiar characters and setting I think it's worth a play.","Oct 1, 2020 at 7:10 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:35:19.699203,Jaymacibe,Game needs patching,"I love Saints and Sinners, the feeling to melee a walker is so fun. The less fun is weapons breaking and a day/night cycle.

Here I was hoping for this game to have none of that and so far it doesn't. I only tried the intro, 1 savenging mission, and was doing Daryl's story mission. There is one HUGE reason I got fed up and had to stop playing and hope this gets patched.

Grabbing walkers is not working as indended. I sure wish it is easy to grab them but for the 2nd time in a row when I grab a walker, guess where my off hand goes? WAYYYYYYYYYY off screen. My arm gets everal feet longer and I can't do anything but sit there and die. This has been done twice now and when I was doing the intro mission I was having just as hard issues to ""grab then shoot"" because after I grabbed my controllers would go hairwire and just stay in place. They would rotate but won't move.

Something is wrong with that and when you are trying to stab walkers and the game gliches like that, its not fun. Also the use of arms in VR rarely work, my arms would kept flinging around when I'm trying to get a stab in.

The game needs some serious patching for melee combat and how colisions work for the VR arms.","Oct 4, 2020 at 1:52 AM",3, 0,

In my opinion, it would be very nice if you can use your second hand for more than just collecting things and triggering a reload animation... I mean in nearly every game which has weapons you can reload like in real life, why not in this game? All in all the guns are kinda useless, I mean they have like no damage... 3 headshots for a kill? Come on, they feel like toy guns. The next thing is the level design... There's only one way, I expected an open world like gameplay or at least different ways to go through but the current solution is a bit boring. The physics are okay but there are way too few things you can interact with, the world around you is very detailed and looks nice, but then you realize the only thing you can do is walk around and kill those zombies... That's a bit disappointing and I think (especially if you play VR) it should feel as realistic as possible. There are also still a few glitches/bugs (especially with the enemies) but nothing special.

Good things are: the amount of zombies, little side mission things, a bit of gore (i havent unlocked katana yet), you can easily grab and toss around zombies and a bunch of others. Bad things adre: mainly the amount of buggy things, when you stab someone the blade can a lot of the time slip and just slightly cut the zombie making it annoying, the scavenges after a while can get repetitive, i also dont know why guns are weak but the shotgun is really weak for some reason.

2022-05-28 18:35:22.845787,TheLegion_,About that thing,"Alright so, first off wanted to say its a very good game, fun to play, story missions are good, runs are really fun to play even though sometimes too short and not that dangerous, i absolutely love the fact that you did not add stamina into this, at least regarding the fighting, so we can actually prove how good in shape we are while knifing down walkers. Guns work very good too, shooting and hitting zombies is very satisfying, although the fact that the reload animation is basically a fixed animation once you even get close to the pistol with a magazin in the other hand kind of annoys me a bit.

Now, the one thing that really ruins half of the experience for me is a mistake a lot of VR Game devs make. It's switching up the Controls for left handed people. Yes, we are left handed, but were not weirdos. We still move with the left Stick and look around with the right stick, we just shoot guns and use melee weapons with our left hand.

2022-05-28 18:35:22.878698,djspod,Game is AMAZING and very fun!,"This game is crazy fun and taking on the relentless walker herds is what does it for me. There is just a couple of mechanics which could be fixed within 1 patch update, for example the reloading mechanic isnt great and 3 shots for 1 walker needs to be changed, but aside from that, definetly worth it!","Sep 30, 2020 at 7:15 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:35:25.992371,alexo417,great game but there is one BIG problem,"so, the game is amazing but the only problem that i have is a BIG problem. everytime a walker grabs me, i can no longer move my hands to get the walker off me. the only thing i can do is rotate my hands which does nothing because i cant reach for ANYTHING. is there anyone who knows how to fix this problem?","Sep 30, 2020 at 12:44 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:35:26.009325,enmity.free,I don't mind,"Not the technical achievement SnS was. If you can look past its flaws, this game is just fun. I might even enjoy it more than SnS, though some seem to be expecting an SnS sequel. Whoever decided a walker should take more than 1 shot to the head is a doofus. It doesn't fit lore and does nothing to help gameplay","Sep 30, 2020 at 7:06 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:35:26.025282,Dio,So far so good...,"Problem was me, nuf said ! Good game, but it does look kinda cartoonish ! No left right guns and why do you even have to grab one by the throat ? Good game ! Bizzare sh.. control wise ! I hated the tutorial, she kept saying it over and over ! No like here and talk about it and shhhh ! Hehehe","Oct 1, 2020 at 3:19 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 18:35:26.059192,Skye ,I wouldn’t reccomend,Saints and Sinners just has so much more to offer in terms of gameplay and story.,"Oct 29, 2020 at 12:50 PM",2, 0,
