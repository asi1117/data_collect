We all have family and friends that are interested in VR and this is the perfect VR experience to show people. Just warn them that it does get a little bit scary at the end and remind them that no matter how amazing it looks it’s not real. There isn’t much to do with this experience other than hold on and enjoy the ride. By pressing up and down you can compare the forward and deferred renderer (shows how clear the graphics are even at a distance) by pressing left and right to change the pixel density for each renderer. But it’s best to just play it full pelt and enjoy it as it should be seen.,"May 21, 2017 at 12:09 AM",5, 8,
