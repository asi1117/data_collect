2022-05-28 20:20:32.233847,eldritchepoch,Extremely underwhelming,Terrible graphics and you can't even move around in the model. It's a good thing its free but completely dissapointing.,Dec 7 at 1:58 AM,2, 4,
2022-05-28 20:20:32.248808,price_kelley,Short but Epic!,"This is a very short and perhaps not the most accurate depiction of a historic landmark location but it is done very well, the audio is superb with deep reverb and echo, well situated alocated spots to view from, some really nice effects but where are the follow up apps? the app highlights other locations like the Bastille but gives you nothing other than a title? one annoying maybe deliberate effect I didnt like was the huge halo's surrounding the lens area (periferall vision) which glow like god rays (but are not) and become distracting. Its a shame its so short because the atmosphere created is awsome!",Aug 13 at 12:12 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:32.263767,gadget124,Awful,"Pointless and blurry, literaly hurts your eyes",Jul 6 at 12:08 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:32.278727,Deeperbeige,So much missed potential,"Beautiful model and scenary, but totally non-interactive. Seems like a huge missed opportunity to make something as impressive as this with no locomotion options. I understand it was made for a public show (where you need to consider things like getting people in and out quickly, and the user learning experience), but come on, would it have killed you to make a special version that reverts to free motion at the end?","Sep 20, 2020 at 9:42 PM",3, 44,
2022-05-28 20:20:32.293687,nukkuepuss,Immersive tech entertainment teaser,"To experience this for free and give it anything less than a maximum rating is ludicrous.

All it does is showcase a few parts of the cathedral, inside and outside, that are stunningly detailed and alive. You can only move around your physical area (and you can’t control when the scene changes), so just enjoy it for those brief seconds. Physically move yourself around the scene to get an amazingly different vantage point. Drink it in.

The lighting is incredible, from flickering candles to sun-shafts that look suspiciously real-time. The scale and depth are perfect.

It’s teeming with Assassin’s Creed characters, all milling about amongst a wealth of other detail just waiting to be picked out. Chandeliers sway slightly, dust motes hang in the air, rivers flow, pigeons fly about.

There’s no graphics options and the presentation is minimal, but it’s beautiful in its technical accomplishment, especially the balloon ride at the end. Play it again immediately.

I’d call this a free peak into how Ubisoft see immersive tech entertainment's future. Assassin’s Creed with backdrops like this? I’m in.

Let's hope we can have a free-movement version next.","Sep 12, 2020 at 5:01 PM",5, 31,
2022-05-28 20:20:35.408945,Scooby-Doo,Why Ruin it?,There's a white sphere surrounding your vision... Why? I don't understand what that adds to the experience... It's just less FOV...... I should be able to teleport around the place. This was just a complete mess and I don't recommend wasting your time on this. You can't even look properly around the area since It just teleports you into a different location.,"Sep 11, 2020 at 5:08 AM",1, 36,
2022-05-28 20:20:35.423906,Rzurzlinho,,"It's free, I know, it is also made by a big company who knows few things about assets. Comparing to many other free experiences/presentations out there, this one is very blurry, textures are low res and basically there's not much in it. What's the reason to put the city in the background if it is a blurred mess. It's free, it's short, didn't hurt too much, 2 stars :)","Sep 12, 2020 at 4:16 PM",2, 16,
2022-05-28 20:20:35.438866,treeml,"Its nice, but so low res....","I get that it's free, and it's nice that it's free, but it's so low res that it kind of ruins the experience. Maybe this was to run on lower end hardware? but then why would anyone with low end hardware want to run something that looks this bad","Sep 25, 2020 at 11:05 AM",3, 15,
2022-05-28 20:20:35.452828,Haddock161,Disappointing,"I know it's free, but it's still disappointing compared to the excellent Discovery Tours from Assasin's Creed. There is no interaction, no walking, juts a sequence of locations triggered automaticaly. And all very blurry. Pointless. I would happily pay for a proper Discovery Tour in VR.","Sep 13, 2020 at 6:00 PM",1, 14,
2022-05-28 20:20:35.468785,daniel.r.palmer,Amazing,"I wish i could free walk around the building areas, but the visuals are incredible and certainly worth a look at. It is amazing what VR can do regarding historical displays and documentation of events. Fantasic job to the devs.","Oct 25, 2020 at 4:51 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:38.568562,dustdown,It's worth the free admission,"Having been to the Notre Dame myself, this was a genuinely nice revisit. The app takes you through different locations in the cathedral, eventually ending up outside the Cathedral. 

The models are detailed and beautiful, taken from the Assassin's Creed games. But it works! 

I just wish you could choose when the scene should end yourself. The final locations are the best ones and deserve more time.","Oct 9, 2020 at 12:00 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:38.583522,Quest787,Incredible free experience,"I’ve been using VR regularly since 2016 and no other experience conveyed a sense of time travel as well as this. What’s more,​ it’s using the assets from Assassins Creed: Unity. There’s a genuine wow moment when you’re transported outside the Cathedral to be surrounded by characters and vehicles from the world of Assassins Creed. There’s no locomotion (and therefore no blinkers), after a minute or so you’re automatically transported to the next location, making this the perfect experience to place a first time VR user in. If they’re older and interested in history, it will blow their mind.","Sep 12, 2020 at 6:20 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:20:38.598482,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Why,"Why artificially limit the experience? It has lower than needed render resolution. Low poly versions of AC Unity models. And there is no free roam. I am just trying to appreciate the church but can't. 

Sidenote; Ubisoft needs to release their ""tourist"" editions in VR.","Oct 4, 2020 at 4:30 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:38.612444,stealthnyc,Love the idea but allow movement,"I would pay a few bucks to be able to freely walk around in this environment.  As an architect, I love games that allow me to explore buildings.  The hot air balloon was a nice surpise, but wish it could have gone around the whole building.  Please add ability to move freely!  Thanks.","Oct 9, 2020 at 8:48 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:38.628908,northbayray,This is what I came to VR for.,"This! My dream has long been to be a time traveller, and to see things that are long gone to history, just to get the ambient feel of being in a certain place at a certain time - read Time and Again by Jack Finney to see what I mean. This is the closest thing I can get to right now. If you love Titanic or Apollo 11, this is for you. I really hope this becomes a series so we can see Rome 100 AD, New York 1900, Pearl Harbor 1941, etc.  It would be nice to explore a little bit but not complaining, this is beautiful and free and absolutely worth the download.","Sep 18, 2020 at 8:28 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:41.744168,Schifferisabel,Meh,"If you're house is the size of Notre Dame, then here's the game for you. To be fair, the game does say that you need a big space. Downloading this, I didn't know it was by ubisoft, and while I'm sure the scenery would look great if I was looking at it on a screen but, in VR...it doesn't look great. Which is a shame since that's the whole point of the ""experience"". There's also a white outline that makes it even worse. I mean it's free so why not try it, but you get what you paid for","Oct 3, 2020 at 1:57 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:41.760125,sproketz,Very pretty. No accessibility features.,"You can't choose to move around and explore yourself in this unfortunately. It also only supports standing. So if you're in a wheelchair, too bad I guess. I mean, how hard would it be to incorporate both sitting and standing heights for such a basic experience? Could have been great, sadly it's fairly featureless. No menus, no nothing. They also auto advance you, even if you are not ready to go to the next area. Not well thought out at all. Gave it two stars because it's free. Would have been one otherwise.","Sep 15, 2020 at 7:21 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:41.775085,benshine,Very beautiful but...,"Get rid of this white shine around the view. It destroys immersion. Graphics option for higher resolution + scene skipping would be a nice addition, because the later scenes are more impressive like the ballonride. Maybe teleport for putting into better position when you don't have much space! 

I really like this to show other. 

Please Ubisoft take us around in old egypt from assassins greed! Would love to stay on the pyramids and within them + some tombs and deserts.","Sep 27, 2020 at 9:55 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:41.791043,stargate88,Best way to visit Notre-Dame now,"ok, maybe not the best VR experience but it' free and the graphics are good. I think it was a very good initiative from the developer now that it's closed because of the fire to let people quickly visit the cathedral.","Oct 3, 2020 at 8:52 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:41.806003,Kristoff63,For me....Fantastic.,"REALLY enjoyed this Ubisoft.  PLEASE make some more VR content on this subject.
To be able to go back in time, all in glorious surround vision VR was an amazing experiance.  Don't know how easy it is to produce but more please.
The only thing I would say, a small complaint, is that we can't linger in each scene
for very long.  I could sit in that town square watching the world go by for ages.","Sep 15, 2020 at 3:45 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:44.916864,Acalas,Excellent VR experience,"I have tried many VR but this one is exceptional as far as making you feel you are truly there.  Maybe it's the proper scaling of the scenery, so it looks real.  I can move about by walking around my room, very convincing.  Love it.","Sep 23, 2020 at 2:25 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:44.931823,isaaccheng8,Great experience. Please add teleport.,It reminds me of my last trip to Europe in the pre-COVID era. The hot balloon ride is awesome. Please add the ability for users to teleport using Oculus Touch.,"Oct 5, 2020 at 1:15 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:44.946783,danwarb,Nice free scenes from the AC game.,Easy to run. Would be nice if there were options to improve image quality.,"Sep 11, 2020 at 10:05 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:20:44.962741,Chroko,Let down by poor presentation.,"I have to echo the sentiments of other reviewers. Despite a mostly impressive 3D reconstruction of Notre-Dame (barring some low-resolution textures if you lean in close to inspect some surfaces) - the presentation is what fails here. It is obviously designed to be shown to visitors at a public exhibit, with a strict time limit so the next visitor isn't kept waiting. But as a VR experience you can download at home, it is disappointing. The player is teleported through a series of fixed scenes around the cathedral that barely gives you enough time to look around - and it also doesn't allow for any free movement or exploration. This is just lazy and could have easily been so much better.","Oct 3, 2020 at 3:32 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:20:44.979696,szy33,Wasted potential,"Very low reslution. Looks like a game from 2005-2010. You can't do anything. There isn't a button to get to the next location. Game decides when you should teleport. If your room is too small, you wont be able to look where you want to look as there is no movement. The water from seine looks awful.

2022-05-28 20:20:48.070037,bigcat1969,,The first time I tried this it was a mess. Then I followed the advice in another review and kicked up Oculus Tray and set Default Super Sampling to 1.9. I tried again and this time the blurriness and much of the flicker and jerking were gone. When seen clearly this is a lovely experiance. Thanks Ubisoft. I join others in asking for a paid experaince based on cities already in your system from making your games.,"Oct 2, 2020 at 10:30 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:20:48.084997,HotWasabiPeas,"Nice ""virtual tourism"" experience","This app is a nice addition to the ""virtual tourism"" category. Yes, it's a little rough around the edges in terms of the user experience, but it makes a decent demo, and it's entirely free. Constructive criticism is fine, but giving this app one or two stars for minor shortcomings is simply unfair, IMO.","Sep 19, 2020 at 7:28 AM",5, 0,
