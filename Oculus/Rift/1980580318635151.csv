Bought it on steam about a year ago and it was working fine until I started getting ""fatal error has occurred"" popping up every few seconds. I had passed the refund time on steam and could find no way of contacting the developers so I've been stuck with a broken game that I can't play. I actually really enjoyed the game so I bought it again on oculus store, in the hopes that this version might work as intended but here I am with the same error (FYI I don't get this error with any other vr game) , hoping a dev will respond and offer a fix, if not, I will be requesting a refund and definitely not be recommending the game, even on a sale. Feeling pretty ripped off tbh...","May 5, 2019 at 11:37 PM",1, 21,

2022-05-28 16:43:48.091800,dysphunktion,Possibly installed a bitcoin miner...,"*UPDATE*
So after quite a bit more ""investigating"", I simply can't say that this game was the source of the malware. There are far more likely sources specific to my machine and actions. But since I can't completely rule it out, just be cautious.
All that being said, I do enjoy this game quite a bit. The arena nature would be the only real complaint I have. It'd be great if it was a bit more involved. But I absolutely love mindless shooting games in VR. I think it holds it's own when compared to something similar like Raw Data, which I wish I could refund.
The shooting is very satisfying. The enemies are your typical zombies save for some rather interesting bosses.
I'm leaving my original review below just to err on the side of caution!
----
So I bought this game early this morning, before I headed to work.
My machine was fine. When I get home, I decided to try it out. Seconds after launching the Oculus software my system slowed to a crawl. I opened task manager and saw a process named ""minerd.exe"" utilizing 100% of my CPU.
I ended it and went to the folder it was installed in and noticed that the timestamp on some of the files matched when I attempted to launch the game.

This could very well just be a coincidence. I can't think of a way to link the miner with this installation. I would hate to make an accusation without proof. So I am simply suggesting that it's possible.","Mar 21, 2018 at 2:46 AM",4, 43,
2022-05-28 16:43:48.108754,Gzepp,no one online,"fun to play , with gimmicky slow mo bullet time action , but I have never played online with another person in this game. .. i dont think anyone plays this online anymore ??","May 26, 2018 at 10:23 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:43:48.124712,DigitalHazard,Glitchy,"You can fall through the floor, hang in walls or find spots where zombies do not reach you. The overall programming quality and glitchyness of the mechanics is that of a hacked together Game Jam result. Please get some QA and fix your bugs and levels guys. -

Stepwise turn should have more steps. It has like 90+ degree per turn. This way you always have to rotate your body back to adjust after a turn step to get the actual direction you want. And you loose track of the surroundings and stuff going on. I think 30 degree turn steps are best, maybe with an hysteresis in the thumbstick axis, so you can use small movements without having to go to the center. -

Imao Bullet time should not reduce your walk speed. It does not reduce teleport distance or cooldown so whats the point. Just annoying. - 

Content and levels looks good but for me, but the Zombies are not really scarry to me personally. If you remember the ZVR Zombie Showcase Models (an old DK2 Demo, still on youtube), these were scarry up close, but the models and sounds used here, look and feel more like an acarde game. Maybe it's required for the sheer mass and poly count. Zombies must make me want to flee in panic xD -

Btw. Multi Player is unplayable out of sync. I do not understand why, because UE4 makes multiplayer really easy to implement. Actually I do not see what on earth could lead to these problems for such a simple game. Maybe I'm wrong but from my experience, I think it could only happen if you try(!) to implement multiplayer yourself instead of using the engine build-in and fail. - 

Other than that it is ok to play for the price, maybe it will develop into a 4* game for me after fixing of the bugs and mechanics =)","Feb 8, 2018 at 9:26 AM",3, 6,

   I have to sit while playing this; sometimes  it'll make you lose your bearings, and you might run into something ( no, i don't have the shield turned on).
   I've only been on single player, so can't comment on ther modes.  It's pure fun, don't get nit-picky about it.","Feb 22, 2018 at 11:35 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:43:51.242885,Omnipotency,SP is fun.  MP is broken.,"Single Player version seems to work pretty well as a standard wave shooter.  Plenty of Character perks, weapons, unlocks, etc.  Graphics are believable.  Run's pretty smoothly on my i5-7400/1060/8gb machine.  That said, MP is just not there.  The game connects, but the person joining lags to a point it's not even worth it.  You'll be upwards of 15s per game behind sometimes.  This was with a friend we generally have no more than 50/60ms ping to each other.  Tried disabling FW and a few other tweaks to no avail. 

For now, it's a fun single player game, but don't expect to play with your friends.","Feb 3, 2018 at 1:58 PM",3, 5,"Hi，Thanks for the report.The online latency is very serious.We are looking for bugs , consulting relevant technicians, and will fix the bug as soon as we find it.Very sorry for affecting your game experience.If the bug fixes, we will tell you immediately."
2022-05-28 16:43:51.256848,RavenousWombat42,,"Awesome game and well worth the money. It has great graphics, plays smooth, the controls are solid, and like everybody else already said.. this is what killing floor should of been, and it's $30 cheaper!  

I'm extremely impressed and can't wait to see what content they have planned in the future.   If you love blasting zombies, smashing heads, and all while having it as real as the rift can look, it's totally worth it.

The only downsides I can think of is the translation to english. There are alot of goof ups, but at least they're funny. Also, there's no forward grip options on rifles, and bolt actions cycle themselves.

Boss battles are something else.. prepare yourself.","Feb 8, 2018 at 7:14 AM",5, 3,
