2022-05-28 19:51:46.587145,ParadiseDecay,Interesting take on the FNAF genre.,"My Quick thoughts:
An interesting take on the Five Nights At Freddies type genre, but set in a mine. The scale is off, you feel like a giant but the initial jump scares are cool and the mines have a great atmosphere. I made it to level 2 in my video. (I believe there are only 5 levels?) 
All in all not a bad little game for the price of a bag of chips.
