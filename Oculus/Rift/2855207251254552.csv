However, it is an intersesting concept and I would like to see how it turns out in the future. It could be a worthy investment if you are interested in pollution issues.","Dec 28, 2020 at 12:04 AM",2, 5,"Thanks for the feedback. Did you try turning the graphics quality up in the main menu?

The tutorial is very basic--it's really just textual informational at this point. Was there any information that was missing there that you wanted to see?

I'm glad you found the concept interesting even if the gameplay wasn't to your liking. I certainly hope players find the experience fun to play, but the real goal is to experience the world as another living creature. The next volume will focus a bit more on the perceptual world of the animal you're embodying (a butterfly with tetrachromatic vision) to try to make it more realistic."
