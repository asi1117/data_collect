2022-05-28 14:44:54.910456,GilRift,What a pity : to much lag to play coop,"I try to play with a friend in Coop and we experienced too much lag to continue.
We have both oculus version (we have oculus quest 2 connected to pc with oculus link) with direct line to internet (no wifi). We read on steam forum that devs recommanded to come back to oculus home and resume game but it did nothing.
This issue is known apparently but isn't corrected yet.
We experiment this issue only in this game : no issue with Arizona sunshine, no issue with Trickster VR coop, no issue with star trek bridge crew, no issue with Wands.

Please dev, help us!
Your game is amazing, it works perfectly in solo and it is so immersive but we would like to play in coop... we buy it to play coop !
We count on your support !
PS : if you only want to play solo, this game is incredible (I will give it a FIVE STARS), in coop, we can't play... We are so sad !","May 25, 2021 at 7:46 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 14:44:54.927411,KarbunclePrime,"Wonderful game, a few minor issues.","Have been playing this game CoOp with my older brother and have been having an fun time with it.  First few hours played wonderful, later on we had the guest player experiencing horrible lag we could not fix.

>>Pros<<
~ Aiming with bows is pretty realistic and satisfying, even when its difficult to land shots sometimes.
~ Game has good atmosphere, I hate spiders, they creeped me out, I screeched like a girl when a certain Mini-boss appeared... this is a Pro, cause it was immersive.
~ The games got length to it.  We've played for several hours now and am probably only about ~60% through with the game.   Definitely a good value, double so if you get it on sale. 
~ Difficult, but mostly fair, can use cover to your advantage on archers and you can block all Melee attacks with proper positioning and timing. 
~ Decent enough enemy variety and interesting and challenging bosses.  
~ CoOp is a blast, and how they handle money/gold split is very nice.  

>>Cons<<
~ I wish Items were more than what they are.  They're stat sticks, one does 100 dmg and the other does 50, or one has 300HP and the other has 250HP. 
~ Some areas are cruel lol.  Archers EVERYWHERE, all angles, perfect accuracy, can sometimes shoot at you while they are unseen/behind cover.  At certain times in stage 2 I felt like i was playing an Arcade game designed to suck $$ out of you.
~ Exploding Mushroom enemies are the worst.  If you don't see them coming you're pretty much dead.  
~ Wish the two classes felt more unique.  Currently the only purpose to classes seems to be one gets a bow and the other a crossbow... and thats where the variety ends.
~ But honestly, the 4 rating is almost entirely due bad lag in Coop we could not fix.  Soiled an otherwise very soild game experience which is a huge shame.  That said, your mileage may vary on this issue.","May 8, 2021 at 1:20 PM",4, 12,

2022-05-28 14:44:58.097576,Majik60,A Few Things Could Be Improved,"I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, right up to the point where it became insanely difficult for a single player on ""Normal"" mode to continue. The scenery is gorgeous, and most of the encounters are lots of fun. There are just a few things that should be tweaked to make the game more enjoyable:

Difficulty:

I am playing on ""Normal"" difficulty as a single player decked out in top gear, and find some of the encounters to be way too chaotic for one player. I would expect these types of encounters on a much higher difficulty level.

Awkward controls:

The controls for your inventory and weapons take some getting use to. If you open your inventory on your belt, your weapons should be temporarily hidden so you can grab things unencumbered. I've often found myself reaching for something and firing off a shot from my crossbow by accident. Or grabbing with my sword hand and choosing the wrong slot because the sword blocked my view. 

If you are just trying to organize things and move a potion too close to your face while doing so, you will end up unintentionally consuming the potion. 

If you are in your room and standing in front of your storage chest to stash things, and your right side is too close to the trash can mouth, and you pick something up from your inventory with your right hand... say goodby!

Crossbow aim:

There are times when I know my aim was dead on, and the arrow missed my target to the left or right, even at close range. This is very frustrating and happens more often than not. A game breaker IMO.","Aug 26, 2020 at 1:29 AM",4, 19,

2022-05-28 14:44:58.128493,Desynchronize,Excellent Co-op fun,"Started playing this game with a friend before the current update.  It was really cool, but nearly unplayable at the time because we'd disconnect constantly, despite our other multiplayer games not having issues.  We ultimately took a break and came back after the content 3 update.  The disconnect issue has been resolved.  We tore through the rest of the game and just wish there was more!  

Very immersive and breathtakingly gorgeous environments.  Challenging, awesome boss fights, and the combat is spot on.  You must slash around blocking weapons and can block incoming attacks, and the bow feels authentic.  I do wish there was another store with better gear or that your homebase store got better gear in as you advanced.  

A side thought: it would be cool if there was a public pub or something you could hang out in.  Maybe play a card game with your collected cards and meet other players who might want to join your party.","Jul 28, 2020 at 2:24 AM",5, 26,

2022-05-28 14:45:01.245763,cybernettr,Okay,"The positive ratings for this game heavily lean on multiplayer. If you play single player, it’s less impressive. Repetitive gameplay, limited sound effects, no ability to bash opponents with bows, somewhat wonky thumb stick movement￼, Little atmospheric music, no in game map, limited battle options, lack of sneak ability, and enemies that sometimes seem to run right into—or through you￼—detract from this.

The first time I beat it with my friend it crashed for him so he didn't get the boss weapon or final chest.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POAGlE7P5HM

My Initial Impressions:
This game just gets better and better with each update. The devs for this title really know how to step up their game.
If you are into Dungeon Crawlers, this is probably one of the best ones out there! And in VR it's even better.
To say this game is still in EARLY ACCESS it's shaping up to be one of the best RPG style games available for VR.
The game oozes quality and attention to detail, it now has a cool story mode, new locations and new enemies. The story starts when a strange alien wizard creature asks you to embark on a perilous journey to seek out items he needs. Like any traditional RPG you'll find loot, armour, items and cool weapons to aid your adventures.

2022-05-28 14:45:07.587597,randmh1,"Ok graphics, poor controls","The graphics are great and the game promises much, but the controls did not work.  Forward moves in the direction you are pointing the controler, so when you defend with a shield or are cranking the crossbow forward changes direction.   The sword mechanics did not work for me.  It seemed like the sword only randomly hit.  I was swining for all my might and was only hitting about every 3rd swing even when the goblin was right in front of me and not blocking.  If the controls were improved I would definetly want to try again.  I also was missing much of the loot, as  the color of the coins blends in with the cave walls.  I had to retread the same ground multiple times to find all the loot floating in the air.","Aug 19, 2020 at 1:13 PM",2, 0,"You can change the controller options in settings in-game. Don't like controller controlled direction? Choose something else, it is all there :)

Sword mechanics are a velocity based and there is an anti-wiggle system in place. Your sword need to properly exit the enemy mesh before you can hit again. Wildly swinging your sword around will usually lead to exactly what you are describing.

We suggest practicing a bit on the target dummies to get the hang of it."

2022-05-28 14:45:13.905457,justalexisfine,If only multiplayer worked well...,"The game itself is gorgeous. Graphics and set design are incredible for a VR game. Combat mechanics are pretty good, melee combat is a bit futzy, enemies frequently move through me to my other side, so that gets a little troublesome and breaks immersion. I'm more of a ranged fighter anyway, though, so not too mad at that.

The real bummer here is that the multiplayer is and has been pretty much unusable for as long as I've been playing. Apparently this has something to do with the Oculus matchmaking, according to a previous post I saw from the developers. Hopefully it eventually gets resolved... That's all I really wanted from this game. I'm not looking for more solo gaming experiences, I'm looking ways to have fun with my friends.

Now, when the multiplayer HAS worked, it's been a blast. The enemies scale well and it's great fun to shoot and slash your way through a boss fight with your friends.

It's my understanding that this game is made by a studio that is essentially just five people going it on their own, so what they've achieved knowing that is quite remarkable, I just hope that these issues can get resolved so that I can enjoy the experience I thought I was paying for when I bought it.

TL;DR - if you want a solo dungeon crawler, this is for you. If you want coop play, I'd wait until things progress to full release, if it ever gets there (I bought this game like a year ago, and there doesn't seem to be any progress.)","Oct 10, 2019 at 2:31 AM",4, 16,The multiplayer issue should have been addressed now :)

On day 1 we played and I got incredibly motion sick. The biggest issue was whenever I was facing away from my sensors in real life, my bow ""shorted out"" and wouldn't get tracked properly, causing me to switch to the analog stick in a panic to avoid death, which I much prefer the teleport. 

Once I set up my 3rd sensor for 360 play, it was much better. However I think the controller menu is a bit confusing and not all the settings are explained well. I REALLY wish more games would adopt the control style of Robo-Recall, specifically teleporting, but aiming the direction you will face when you land with the analog stick. I have found that to be the least nauseating VR control style for movement.","Dec 5, 2019 at 1:55 AM",4, 1,"Hi Mafiki, thanks for your review.

My daughter loves the fact that she can play it with me, not me telling her step by step what to do but just being beside her and talking about what we saw or just did as a team. She loves the control. She started off as an  archer but really took to useing the dagger and shield. The controlls seem natual to her once she understood wiggling did nothing. Collecting loot was by far the biggest attraction. She got richer the more she played and with that she was able to buy her own stuff, and that was a new experience for her. As her coop partner and father I was amazed how she reacted to each enemy, brave and at some times tictical. She would tell me to take on the archers and she'll handle sword wielding enemies and dogs. She understood the enemies an approced them as types, arrow types, sword types, plant types and dogs (they're wolves by she calls them dogs.) Now there is one character later part of the game that is topless and I was prepaired to have a discussion with her about nudity in games but to my naive daughter she just saw a flying enemy and proceeded to shoot her down, a conversation for another day. 
      Setting up coop was also easy for her as well. She had two choices host or join then we always chose friends to avoid any unwelcome guest. The only time we had joining issues was when my character was way overpower compaired to hers. In that case I didn't mind starting a new character, the game was fun and fair. If there is one thing I do wish the developers would add (other than the other classes) is aggro system. That way she can continue to slash away at ""dogs"" while I can assist with my arrows and not steal her opponent. Good Job so far divs, can't wait for new content.","Aug 28, 2019 at 4:33 AM",5, 35,

I have tried at various times of the day thinking that might be the issue, but no luck. Second, once you beat the game, you should be allowed to keep your gear and try again at a higher difficulty level. I hate earning / buying gear just to have to start over if I play again. 3rd, you can't change the difficulty when hosting your own game (not that anyone's ever joined a game I try to host).

2022-05-28 14:45:20.261818,MakiGei,a couple questions and some new ideas,"First of all let me say this game is AMAZING, especially for an early access game, its so beautiful and well done.
1: My main question is about the third dungeon, is that going to be the whole thing? i assumed not but since you get the ""eye of the Dwarves"" after that fight it seems like the end. 
2: Also will you be adding some form of aim assist to thie game? i can land my shots most of the time but with really high up enemies its hard to hit them without missing 100 times.

As for my ideas, 
3: it would be great if you could give arcgers the ability to turn off the dagger spin if we want to because there have been many fights where its either goten me killed or almost gotten me killed because i wasnt doing damage
4: I love the archer and the warrior but theres a lot of talk about magic in the game but i dont see a mage? is a third class coming? If not i think it would be an awesome idea. Perhaps the mage's melee weapon would be a staff, and the ranged some kind of wand or gauntlet that equips over the gloves. as with most games i feel like the mage could be more versatile and powerful but perhaps with lower health and not as good armor. In order to add this versatility i speak of, you could utilize both trigger buttons (on the same controller) for different attacks, maybe one as a fireball of some kind for long range that behaves like an arrow, and the other as a close range area lightning attack or poison (because of the fungus enemies).
itd be great if you could take my questions and ideas into consideration :)","Jul 23, 2019 at 5:08 AM",5, 19,

While dual wielding the daggers I noticed that quite a lot of my hits wouldn’t register when using both weapons simultaneously. Now I’m not sure if this is intended (which kind of is an immersion breaker if you are trading defense for more offense) but it’s very annoying and have found myself having to work harder to get a kill than when using sword and shield. I restarted the game as a warrior and have had a much easier time using sword and shield.

Your options for combat are ""shoot enemy with arrow"" or ""swing weapon at enemy."" It would be nice to be able to use magic, or buff your weapon, but even with the limited combat options the fighting is incredibly fun.

2022-05-28 14:45:23.430461,Baker1kenobi,Possibly the best game in VR ATM!,"I've played dozens and dozens of games in VR and I'm always looking for the one that keeps me captivated and allows me to enjoy it with friends. Karnage Chronicles is that game. As someone who played World of Warcraft in the early days pretty avidly I find myself mesmerized in the dungeons in awe of the detail the devs have included. At first I thought this was going to a hack n slash through waves of mobs to the quick end. Boy was I wrong. This game is full of puzzles and tactical approaches that continue to wow me. I can't wait to see what else they add. I'm hoping for additional classes like a mage and a healer. I would pay over and over again for this game if they add DLC content and expansion packs.  The multiplayer has been a blast with friends. We've had hours of entertainment. 

It is early access so of course there are quirks here and there but the devs are engaged and none of it is a show stopper whatsoever. Some things I'd like to see implemented are:

Ability to turn off friendly fire - I know it adds to the realism but 3 or 4 guys in tight quarters swinging and launching arrows wildly just trying to survive ends up in a lot of unintentional team kills. 

Ability to turn off and/or control volume for in-game voice chat.  

Ability to put all weapons away with a button. - Currently I use one of my 3 weapon ""loadouts"" with nothing equipped to accomplish this but I'd rather not have to sacrifice those slots. It is much easier to take potions and manage inventory with empty hands so something needs to be done here. 

Ability to shied bash - this could inflict small damage or at least knock back enemies. 

I think this might be coming based on the satchel in the store with the ""coming soon"" label but we need the ability to get a bigger inventory. 

The archer could use just a little work. - sometimes with an arrow drawn back if I strafe to avoid an incoming arrow the aiming gets cocked to the side and you cannot re-center it until you release that arrow.","Aug 2, 2019 at 9:20 AM",5, 5,

Fix the archer.  The warrior's crossbow, with its ability to fire 5 shots while holding one position and ""zeroing"" in on the target with subsequent shots, made it superior to the archer's ability to consistently hit his/her target between shots.  The archer has to draw the bow for every shot which, when fatigued after about an hour or two of twanging the bow, makes it impossible to keep aim and string-pull consistent between shots.  If the developer's goal was to make it realistically difficult to be an archer at the expense of the enjoyment of the class, then mission accomplished.  It's supposed to be FUN, not fatiguing and frustrating.","Dec 6, 2019 at 2:29 AM",2, 0,"Not dead, just working on a crucial engine upgrade as communicated here and there.

The immersion of the environment and the visceral combat are the best aspects of this game. There are many other great things about KC that I won't go into. It's best you experience them for yourself. I LOVE the sword combat. You can parry, block, riposte, slash and stab. So can your opponent. The enemy AI is very good. As a warrior, the only one of the two classes I've played so far, you have a sword and shield and a crossbow. Most enemies are smart enough to dodge and/or block your ranged attacks, so no matter how well you aim, a headshot isn't always guaranteed.

OK. I'd like to write more praise, but I want to wrap up this review and get back to playing! Here's my nitpick items: Only two classes, and VERY limited inventory space. I'm holding onto hope the developers will add a storage chest, or backpack expansions... and maybe a spell caster class?

Either the graphics look like a five year old made them or there are problems with the networking aspect. This game is the best multiplayer game I have played to date and should be the bar that all games rise to. The graphics are epic and the game in comparision to other vr games is HUGE.

2022-05-28 14:45:26.580158,superpozition,"If I could give this 1k stars, I would","- This game is so unbelievably mind blowing, I don’t even have the words to describe it. I have never experienced a more immersive game in my entire life (not just VR, but ever)
- Also, unlike pretty much every VR game on the planet, the graphics are AAA. Absolutely stunning. 
- there was so much thought and detail put into this game, you will always be asking yourself “what else can I do?”. For example, if an arrow gets stuck in you, you physically can pull it out and throw it back at the enemy. Bravo devs. Seriously, bravo. You can physically hand other players anything in your inventory, and so much more. 

Conclusion: I just (accidentally) played 6 hrs of this game and didn’t realize it. You can play alone, but it’s way more fun with one more person due to what you can do. But to close the loop, this game will pummel everything else out there. It has set the bar so high for VR that I truly believe it’s going to make a real impact on VR devs; no more half a**ing it. No more low quality graphics. This is setting the stage for VR forever to come. Bring it on.

Response to the devs response below: DONT even worry about it. I was just learning things. Had to get a handle on it. All you need to do is add labels below the inventory bubbles so people have some affordance on what each one does. But once I learned it, I didn’t even care. Also, add a persistent tooltip above the relevant bubbles with an accelerator saying “press (B) to toggle weapons”. Small changes, big impact. But omg, doesn’t even matter. This game. Woo!!!

The developers hunted down those multiplayer bugs and resolved them... in the Steam version of their game. On Oculus we're several versions behind with no solution in sight. At this point we have to assume that the Oculus store version has been abandoned. fact 1, do NOT buy this game from the Oculus store. fact 2, do you really want to spend money on a game which the developers simply abandon if inconvenient?

OLD ANSWER: Hi Catwalader, sorry for the inconvenience, what you are experiencing doesn't happen to everyone. Where and when have you tried reaching out to us? NO, the Oculus Store version is NOT ABONDENED. The fix for the crashes you are experiencing cannot be deployed to Oculus Store due to a bug that was introduced in the Oculus Multiplayer Matchmaking and VOIP backend that our current engine version is using. This bug was introduced by Oculus themselves and they haven't fixed it, so we are waiting for an engine version which lets us circumvent the issue. Once we have that we will fix it and deploy a new version. And don't just look at the number of versions, on Steam new versions sometimes comes out because on Steam we have to support more than just one VR HMD, meaning they might only contain new VR HMD support. Please contact me on Steam and I will try to help you with a temporary fix, add Braccar."

Karnage is a small but really well executed game. Graphics are really nice, mysterious, fairy tail like, weapons few, but feel nice when using them. I especially like the fact that you actually have to put some effort into cutting, otherwise you won't do damage.
Voice acting contributes to the atmosphere and there are both ways of moving implemented (direct and teleport). Honestly, the only thing that kinda bothers me is the lack of visible body. Just hands. I do understand that kinematic is a hard thing to do so I don’t hold it against the devs, but dammm, it would contribute to overall feel of the game so much!

2022-05-28 14:45:32.867164,JackJC95,"Promising, but some frustrating issues","Pros:
- Melee combat is quite satisfying when it works, damage being based off the velocity of your swing and the hit location makes for some satisfying, somewhat strategic fights.
- Archery is solid, took some getting used to but by the final boss fight I was pinging off arrows without even looking, that learning curve is one of my favourite parts about the game.
- The level design often forces you to think strategically about how to approach a room which, combined with the great atmosphere (sound design is excellent) and consistently themed areas, makes for a tense immersive experience.
- Smooth movement and turning was really well done, I never got any motion sickness.

Cons:
- Melee combat does not always work as intended, sometimes sword swings will not register which can be devastating when surrounded by enemies. Parrying can also be a bit inconsistent, enemy sword swings would sometimes look like they went through my shield, though I'm 6'4"" so my height may have played a part.
- Pacing is really bad at times, the 2nd dungeon was far too long (especially compared to the others) and certain rooms (I'm looking at you harpy bridge) were just painful and time consuming instead of challenging. Also, I felt like my gear barely improved throughout the first dungeon and most of the second, then I suddenly received an influx of much better gear, and then nothing for the rest of the game. A more steady flow of gear improvements would have been nice.
- The game did crash once when going through a portal. Only happened once and didn't ruin the game for me but still worth mentioning, particularly as I have seen others say the same.

Overall:
A fun fantasy experience with mostly satisfying combat and RPG mechanics, hampered by a few frustrating issues. Length is okay at 5 hours, would prefer more (obviously) and it looks like more may be coming based on a closed off path in the dungeon portals room.","Jun 21, 2019 at 2:40 AM",4, 3,

1. Bow offset option.
2. Quiver!!
3. More vendors throughout the dungeons.
4. Ability to toggle off/on friendly fire – my wife keeps “accidently” smacking me with her weapon.
5. Mage class!

Bugs to note:
1. Sometimes enemies just walk through you, while hitting you, and keep walking. Walking back makes them turn around, face away from you and somehow still hit you.
2. Getting rid of “important items” – I have 3 of these in bag, no clue what / where to use them and can’t drop them.

Also this is UE4, I'm convinced ASW 2.0 is working. There're no video settings in-game, so super sampling is the only option (Oculus Tray Tool). Had to switch to controller-oriented locomotion and then back to HMD-directed to get the latter working, but then controls worked perfectly. Graphics are great, although textures could be better - textures aren't Mage's Tale or Lone Echo quality, but probably more like Torn (slightly PSVR-ish). Some textures are awesome though - try to take a close look at your weapons. Water looks great, I even saw a fish in a lake etc. Levels of polys are nice too - at least better than unmodded Skyrim ;-) 
I'm a chicken in VR, no way I'll play as the usual warrior and having to stand face to face with all sort of horrible creatures, so I went for the bow :-)

Using super sampling 2.0 and a heavily oc'ed GTX 1080 I mostly got 90 fps, ok maybe 60 to 70 % of the time, but unless I waved my hands I didn't notice if fps were slightly lower than 90. But do put the belt away when you're no using it, it may be the difference between 87 or 91 fps ;-)","Apr 22, 2019 at 12:30 AM",5, 1,

I bought the game to join others but NOBODY ELSE IS PLAYING!!! When playing as a warrior you waste so many swings of your sword to do no damage. You basically have to sit there and wait for your target to attack you, you parry and then you swing your sword doing damage, etc, etc, etc. This game was yet another waste of money.

Any fan of dungeon crawlers, RPG's or action games NEEDS to try this out. Reminds me of Mage's Tale but I'll reserve comparisons until I've beaten it. 4.5/5

I thought after I had completed the game that I would just pop in occasionally and beat it again and get no surprizes. Not the case -they are actively adding to it. I poped in a couple of weeks ago to play with my brother and it was like having a whole new game...because they added a whole new section. I also felt the need to say, the game was incredible before they improved it. The last update really upped the antee. It went from awesome to awesome squared. Can't wait to see what's coming.

Update: I have been playing this game for a LONG time...I have decided that these developers are, simply put, my saviors. If I was a religious guy, I would pray to them. I eagarly await any new games they develope and will purchase without hesitation if I see their brand on the game.","Aug 4, 2019 at 6:30 AM",5, 19,

2022-05-28 14:45:45.566657,taquitobuddy,"Amazing quality, hope they finish it","Just completed this game in coop multiplayer.  First, the overall quality is top-notch.  The graphics are among the best I've seen in VR, and I've played everything.  The entire experience is polished.  Multiplayer works great.  Everything pretty much works great.  Voice work is excellent, as is the VR implementation, inventory, controls, options, everything.

So why 3 stars?  Well, the game currently has 2 major drawbacks.  The first is simply lack of content.  There are 2 good size dungeons, and then a really short one, and that's it.  For the price it isn't terrible, but I'd much rather pay $60 (or more!) for a full version of this game with at least 5 times the content.  The other downside is general balance.  There are 2 ""classes"" but the warrior is pointless, the game is extremely ranged-focused.  You can do the entire game ranged and never melee anything, and in 95%+ of the fights, this is the best choice anyway.  In many/most of the fights, you couldn't even melee if you wanted to.  Also, there needs to be more RPG progression.  There's loot, but only super basic stats (damage and HP mostly), and no leveling, no skills, etc.  

I hope the devs manage to complete this game one day, it would be a VR masterpiece.","Apr 11, 2019 at 6:41 AM",3, 1,

It only happens with a few but there are a couple of ways to fix them temporary. The newer Steam version fixes part of the issues but unfortunately we cannot update Oculus Store with this as there is a conflict between Oculus and Unreal Engine that would make multiplayer not work at all if we gave you the update right now.

2022-05-28 14:45:48.714312,Grease,Pretty Good for Co-Op,"The game is quite fun in co-op mode (as it's one of the only dungeon crawlers) but after being 3-4 hours in, it's a bit repetitive in nature. The monsters aren't more difficult, they're just tankier so it takes more time to kill them. My friend plays the warrior class and it seems pointless when we basically only use ranged combat to prevent dying. The bosses are quite easy compared to being mobbed by 5-6 monsters. Due to the nature of ranged combat being much better, a little bit of aim assist would be nice for long ranged shooting as it can take 2-3 minutes to clear a few guys up if they're far away + aim-botting.

This game gets 4 stars instead of 5 for these reasons. 4 instead of 3 because of the co-op working pretty well.","Feb 21, 2019 at 3:12 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 14:45:48.748725,Doum76,Makes me feel like i'm living in WoW :),"Wasn't sure at first. Then, one day it was in special, and decided to give it a try. Wanted to finish another game before starting this one... Started it a few days ago. All i can say is, i just love it, i wouldn't even regret if i'd bought it full price.

The graphic style reminds me when i first got in World of Warcraft decades ago specialy when i've met the Ogre.  Love the environment, the AI of the mobs is just great, at the point you swaer at them for didging your arrows requiring you to reload your crossbow. I'm playing as a Warrior, love the fact you can either block their attacks with your shield or even with your sword, the collision of objet is awesome. I personaly had issues with the Archer class, my aiming was bad, but, got to say, i never really liked playing archers in any games.

Love the changed made from last patches, versus how the game was from the video i've watched from Man of the Antz. Love the small details, as small as how to reset dungeons, even the inventory is cool. :) My only worries is, the game is so fun, i don't know how long it is, but to last the fun, i reseted the first dungeon to get more golds to buy new gears.

Just love the dialog selection/interaction with NPC, feels so muhc different then clicking on choices with a mouse with normal games.

Devs: I was wondering, the game is a year old etc. i was wondering if there is still support for it, can we expect DLCS or new contents eventualy? I do hope so. :)
This is so far my best RPG in VR, beated Mage's Tales by a tons :) Good job!","Feb 7, 2019 at 11:12 AM",5, 1,"Thank you Doum76 for your really nice review. To answer your question, we are still making more content for Karnage Chronicles, including new classes and a level system with talents."

2022-05-28 14:45:51.865982,Sollith,"Nice Game so far, but...","The bow angle is off by several degrees, which makes it difficult to aim (have to rotate wrist forward about as much as I can just to have the bow aim straight). Checked it through the nose gap on the headset too and the bow model definitely isn't properly aligned with the grip position. They should also make the weapon slots clearer (left and right hand, etc.), because it's a bit of guessing the first time playing (the armor slots are pretty self explanatory with the icons on them). 

Otherwise, the little I have played so far seems like a good dungeon crawler; stylized graphics, which age well, animations are solid, seems like there are a variety of upgrade paths, etc. I will have to try multiplayer at some point too. If the grip angle was fixed, I would rate it a five star for the bit I have played so far.","Feb 7, 2019 at 7:17 PM",4, 0,Thanks for the feedback Sollith. We will definitely have a look at the alignment of the bow for the Oculus compared to where your controller is.

2022-05-28 14:45:55.070534,gleep52,So awesome!!!!,"I forgot I was playing an early access game.  Very polished and great mechanics.  Loot was slow going at first but picked up very well and I was happy to see better loot drops than you could buy in the store.  

The first TP scroll was free and I was hoping there were more identifiable spots to use the scrolls or there would be break points with more TP scrolls available.  I never knew where the next boss or checkpoint would be.  So I ended up only using 3 scrolls and beat the whole game.  

I thought that after the first cave/dungeon I’d get to return to the shop but there was always another portal to keep going and it turns out I beat the early access game without knowing it.  I played as an archer originally and I look forward to playing as a warrior a second time.  

It would be nice if there was a stash system in place for extra equipment I don’t want to take with me into the dungeon.  

I think instead of the end portals progressing us to the next cave/shimmer, that it returns us to the shop so we can understand we’ve completed that portion of the game...

I’m writing this more for the developer than for players to read - the game is so fantastic and I’m craving to play it again.  Will there be a magi class in addition to the warrior and archer classes?

2022-05-28 14:45:58.257636,JuicyFruit40,A truely immersive VR dungeon crawler.,"This game is by far one of the better visually stunning VR games i have played so far. The level of detail they put in to this title is amazing. You get a sense of real danger not knowing whats around the corner until a goblin runs up on you and its literally a jump scare if you happen to be turned away at the moment. Make sure to shoot every single pottery that you see, in fact if you think you can shoot it, do it because you will gather up a lot of coins that way. Ok, now to get to the reasons im only leaving a 4 star review instead of 5. First off, im not sure if this is tracking issue with my rift sensors but sometimes while playing archery the bow and arrow tends to slip off to the right even when im in plain few of the sensors. Secondly, the lack of co-op multiplayer population. I have only had the game for about 2 days but i have tried joining co-op to no avail. I have even hosted an open lobby for over 1 whole hour and not one single person joined. Yes, im sure its better if you just invite a friend but randoms arent a bad thing id say when it comes to this game. Id glady update my review to full 5 stars if these few minor things changed for the better but other than that, this is a great game to own on Oculus or on Steam.","Dec 18, 2018 at 2:09 PM",4, 3,

 So...we tried all methods of joining eachothers game, hosting, each one of us tried, both in public and friends only. Just says no ones around, well I know he's around because he's literally playing it in the same house. I can see him. So 50.00 wasted on a game that is now useless. I should have totally gotten dungeon knight. This is what I get.

*So, I was really suprised to hear back from the developer and fast!! It seems they really DO care about our experience! We did buy it on separate platforms, he bought on steam I bought on oculus. I had even tried adding a non steam game to my steam library to see if I could add him to game from chat messages and now it makes sense why it didn't work. Thanks for the help. Not sure what to do now. It speaks volumes that you responded so soon. The game is great, maybe one of us can requerst a refund and buy on the same platform. 

 I still had fun myself, just now knowing that we might be able at some point to play together, im excited again!

 The developer was able to make it so we could play together! We have been having SO much fun!

We use the Oculus Matchmaking system in order to setup matches and we would of course like to figure out why this didn't work for you. We take all these issues quite seriously, and generally speaking there are very few issues with the multiplayer matchmaking. Two things off the top of our heads we can mention here which is likely not your problem but still; 1. Did you both buy Karnage on Oculus Store. It does not support cross-platform yet. 2. Did you both agree to any firewall popups to give Karnage access? I am also trying to add you to my friendslist (Braccar or Thorbjørn Olsen) so we can figure this out."

2022-05-28 14:46:04.549063,AsaBjorn,Beautiful,"Visually pleasing, fun and amusing dungeon crawler. Is in alpha stages but is really enjoyable to play. Has different modes (easy, hard, etc). Cons: bag space, having to buy a portal home each time you return, in my 'home' I cannot reach the scroll on top of the fireplace (I am 5'2"", but i could try a stool irl to reach a virtual piece of paper....just hold my beer). >< Also....and I have not reached the end yet....what the hell am I? I cannot see me. Continual development can make this really over the top, but this game is really great as-is.

update: the scroll on top of my fireplace has mysteriouslly fell to the floor...must be those drafty dungeons (ty)....really enjoyed the story line, would love to see more expansions, improved npc graphics (troll). maybe even a 'return to death' and re-awakened for next quest line. a multi player battlefield,  and more armor choices. good game.","Nov 19, 2018 at 2:41 PM",5, 2,"Thanks for your review AsaBjorn. Glad you are having fun :) More bag space will be added in the next content update, there is a portal in the beginning of each dungeon that takes you back to your home, and the scroll on top of your fireplace can easily be looted by using the tip of your weapon. Hope this helps."
2022-05-28 14:46:04.568013,Vyne,Great game.,"Its a great game,love it so far, the only thing whats bothring me is how to use this bow. In other games i do it like i would in real life, here i need to bend my hands like i wanna use a tiny bow or something. I like archery irl,so i know how to do it. Other than this, it would be a perfect game.

Edit: Hi Braccar. I can only suggest that u try Sacralith: The archer`s tale. That is how you use a bow, and i dont mean the part where you have to get the arrow from your back(although thats cool as well) But how u pull out the whole string and how far. Thanks.","Oct 19, 2018 at 11:39 PM",4, 3,"Hi Vyne, I am Braccar. One of the three developers behind Karnage, not sure why you are bending your hand to use the bow. I am a huge fan of archery and we have pretty much made this the way it would be in real using an old style bow with pull strength. So you can draw your bowstring pretty far back to get more power to the shot. You have two angles, one for the bow angle and one for the arrow angle which can be controlled individually (just because this makes it more fun in-game, wouldn't work well in real of course). Would be really interested to hear more details about what you are experiencing, cause I am confused right now :) :) If you add me we can try to sort out this problem to make sure you have the perfect bow experience. All I can think about is that there is a mismatch between the angle of the bow in-game and the angle of your controller.*UPDATE: cool, will check it out! I am really thinking that what you experienced is some kind of bug."

The enemy reactions to your hits feel very natural but  I just wish that when you got a killing blow on someone with your sword they would be dismembered or something similar to that. I pretty much want more gore .That would make this game the perfect 5 star game for me. I finished just now the game and I gotta say that... i was very dissapointed with the ending. The boss battle was cool and all but the dungeons were very misleading. What i mean is that It took me almost 2-3 hours to finish the first dungeon and less then 1 to finish the second and third together! I thought this whole thing was gone last more + the ending was so weird I didnt even realise the game was over and after looking at other reviews most people need some time to realise this as well. I had to look it up to actually believe it.

2-4 player co-op is here! Play through the campaign together with friends or with random people. Karnage multiplayer comes with full drop-in/drop-out support and can be started at any time after creating a hero and going through the tutorial. Monster strength and number of spawns scale automatically based on how many players are in the party, so feel free to go about your adventures while at the same time hosting a multiplayer game, monsters won't become tougher or more numerous until someone joins your game and it will scale down again when someone leaves. Friendly fire is turned on so be careful when you swing your weapons and lob arrows into melee.

Combat is cumbersome, the way enemies react and parry makes it feel like a turn-based game, despite this being a action-RPG.  Enemies do not face and attack the player head on, but seem to be attacking 45 degrees away from the player.  At one point, the game suggests leaving one hand empty with no weapon equiped to interact with the gameworld, but gives you a sword and shield.  What am I supposed to do with the shield!!!  Developer needs to figure out how to let players interact with the environment with their weapons equiped.  This game is a total mess.  There are better action-RPGs available on Valve's store.","Jan 3, 2018 at 10:09 AM",2, 6,"Hi there econvr.

It is suggested that you leave 1 hand free on a preset, not all presets. You can switch between presets at any time to reveal a free hand (like you would switch between Sword and Crossbow)

But if you are looking for a good Vr Game with melee fights then you should skip this one. 
Altough the game seems to focus on hand to hand combat (along with ranged combat) all you can do - or better - all you are able to do is to wave your weapon in the enemies general direction.

 Sure there is Blocking but due to the attack animations of the eniemies its more or less pure luck for that the enemies weapons are likely to just clip through your shield and hit you anyways. 
The Fights arent very responsive as well. NPCs have fixed ""Hit"" animations in which they stumble for a second and then go back to their attack rotation. 

It should be said, though, that the game is still in development and everything I mentioned might be changed in future updates.

One is the option to choose between a couple of different classes. Ranger and Fighter. (I think they need to add a third class of Mage) There are also difficulty settings, which initially did not seem to work but since an update that seems to have been resolved.  The enviroment and fighting and story are all wonderfully done and really enjoyable with the exception of the differences between the two classes. So as a ranger i would expect to have the ability to kill targets from a distance without them seeing me. This however does not seem to be the case as most enemies will sense/see/? you and charge you right when you are in range of your bow. This of course makes it challenging trying to run and shoot but it does work to a degree.  The fighter class works well though.  I played all the way through, at least I think I was at the end although the story doesn't make you think its the end....?  It was a fun and challenging adventure. I'm hoping it continues soon....","Nov 18, 2017 at 11:32 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:46:14.112828,washad.jacksons,Tremendous Potential -- with some flaws,"When I first started the game, I found myself making sweeping absolutisms such as ""This may be the best game I have ever played."" and ""I wish I could give it six stars."" The visual experience is stunnig but arguably second to the audio. The combination is the closest thing to reality I have ever experienced in a game. The pattering feet of approaching spiders quite literally had me gasping on occasion - and I'm a former Marine. Like dating a hot chick though, some flaws begin to show through with time. 

Seems like the developers are really receptive so hopefully they will take some of these to heart and address them.
- It is too hard; I'm a decent gamer and some of the bosses are near impossible. A dozen tries per boss (on easy level) converts challenging into tedious. 

- Need a map; Getting lost in circles trying to find that left turn hidden in the dark just stops being fun. If you have explored it, map it.
- Need free teleport back home; There is no entertainment value in walking through room after room to get back home so you can buy a new weapon. 
- Conversation with the collector is way too long, I wanted to shoot myself (or it)
- Need to level up; Once you buy all the gear you can buy, there is no way to beat the boss other than trying over and over again. It becomes hopeless. Give me the option of grinding a while, leveling up, and coming back to the boss when I am more prepared. 
- Bow dynamics are great, but the sword dynamics are poor. I'm hitting the enemy over and over again with zero damage. 

As it stands now -- the boredom factor of the game after some play time isn't worth my moving forward. Address these issues,  and I'm back on board. 

Great start nonetheles -- don't mean to sound too critical.","Nov 11, 2017 at 1:20 PM",4, 20,"Hey Washad, thanks for the review! We can ensure you that this game is just getting better step by step. This is a real passion project and every update we release is with focus on addressing selected issues plus introducing new content. We are taking a very careful and deliberate approach to VR game production, with a lot of time sifting through feedback from our supportive fan base. For example, a map is coming (although some players don't want a map because they would rather get lost, this we know from feedback). About the difficulty of the bosses. We have players that chew through the bosses without breaking a sweat, we have players that loves throwing themselves against the bosses time and time again until they beat them, and we have players who would like for the bosses to be a walk in the park. It's hard balancing for everyone's taste :) :)
About the sword wielding mechanics, they are what they are because of feedback from our player base during the past 6 months. It's velocity based, the speed of your swing determines damage from 0 to max. 
Conversations with NPCs is a personal preference, some like it long, some like it short, some doesn't like it at all. That is why we have a SKIP button and later we will introduce subtitles as well.
Again, thanks for your feedback and a big thanks for your positive review. Expect many improvements and much more content during Early Access, and we hope you will come back with every big update and give it a try. Your feedback is valuable :)

Sound is surprisingly good though, better than I'd expect from a $10 game. Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Melee combat is shockingly crude for this type of game. It doesn't have the fidget the sword back and forth problem but it goes to the other extreme where you have to do absurd swings no one would ever make with a real sword and even then, it does pretty much nothing most of the time. Blocking is all kinds of glitchy too. It's early access, so some issues are expected. But this strikes me as a more fundemental issue. Combat just isn't fun, and it doesn't seem to have anything else in it since after about an hour or so and a very sore arm, I still hadn't finished the first quest.","Dec 7, 2017 at 4:08 PM",3, 6,Melee combat and melee AI has been rewritten.

1) I wish there was an option to have your bags and the little display that floats in front of you anchored so it doesn't move with your head; I find that disorienting.
2) The same asset seems to ""vibrate"" a bit which makes looking at your bags and items and whatnot kind of disorienting as well.   It's like it's too sensitive; needing a movement buffer so it's not so sensitive to movement (if it has to move at all, maybe again like 1 that could be optional)

Overall one of my favourite games so far though.   Really looking forward to seeing what this game evolves into, and wondering about any kind of MP functionality one day.

Update:
I really wish there was a way to transport from one checkpoint to another or something, so that when you quit the game (I'm a dad with 4 kids, and a completionist who stops to smell every rose and enjoy every bit of effort they put into this game so I've not even passed the first level yet) and come back to it, you don't have to walk all the way through a dungeon you've possible 90% covered.   Not that I don't enjoy the great scenery, it feels like their art director came from Blizzard which is so cool considering how many years I spent playing WoW.

To answer your question about ""transport from one checkpoint to another""...when you reload the game you are supposed to start at the latest active check point, the reason why this doesn't happen in level 1 is due to a bug.

2022-05-28 14:46:20.464570,TheBatesMotel,Very Immersive. Beautiful Game. True RPG,"I'm loving this game. I feel like  I'm back to the days of having excitment for old RPGs like when I was a kid. The discovery. The loot. The dungeon crawl. Like when you played Diablo when you were 10 years old. Beautiful graphics. Very very beautiful. Free roam moving for those that prefer/can handle it in VR. Voice acting is great.  Well balanced. I'm playing on ""Impossible"" for my first run through, haven't died yet but I think I know why that is.


I've watched some youtube videos of people playing this game. They all somehow seemingly skip tutorials, rush EVERYTHING, wonder where the armor is, wondering how to equip, wonder where this or that or how or why. STOP. SLOW DOWN. It's right there in black and white for you to read and understand. Take it in. Understand the basics by absording a tutorial. Sorry I need to say that. The youtube videos drove me completely insane because of invalid frustration.

Combat is epic. Intense. On impossible difficulty at least, you move and fight like a freakin' real warrior in your living room. You're ducking, stepping side to side, blocking with your left, making hard swing with your right (it detects how hard you're swinging your sword for dmg). I was sweating 15 minutes into my first dungeon and for that I'm thankful. You can play this from the couch on easy or hard, absolutely. But you can be a perfectionist and litterally fight like a roman soldier in your living room to survive.


Here's what I'd add/improve. I know one of the devs are listening because he seemingly pops up in every form of online media to comment and I love that. Dan I think?

-Not enough enemy variations
-Need more different textures and art styles as you progress
-Directional facing teleporting. If I port behind an enemy, I'll be facing away. Give it a timer to prevent abuse.
-More loot/item options.
-More enemy attacks.

Haha, thank you for the shout out TheBatesMotel! 
First of all, THANK YOU for understanding what Karnage Chronicles is, by taking time to explore and find everything you need to survive, and props for jumping in to Impossible difficulty, it's my preferred mode!

We're working on the directional stuff for the controller now (a quick downward flick on the right thumb-stick will do a 180)  hopefully that will fix some problems there.

With regards to enemy types, we have a huge backlog of new monsters we're going to be putting in to Karnage Chronicles! A lot of this will be included in our next content update, and I want to have more texture variations on the current enemies also to make the world feel more alive! We'll be keeping everyone updated as much as we can on our progress! 

We're going to try to push out a patch as soon as possible for a few issues, then jump back on to content creation.

Again, thank you so much for your support! You'll see me stalking around I'm sure.

Its good to see the devs hard at work on it, read that they are adding a mage and cleric class and looking into multiplayer coop. kind of wish it had a leveling system also, but its still a great game. the motion sickness also goes away after a little while. The combat is good, sword parrying and shield bashing would be good that way you could open enemies up with blunt attacks or strategic comboes but right now the bow is the go to because unless you suck (like me) and hit the enemies weapon instead of them, then they cant really block your arrows like they can your sword.","Nov 8, 2017 at 3:49 PM",5, 5,"Thanks for the nice review! We are working on a progression system including levels, not a real RPG without it. Being able to open up your enemies through clever sword play will also be added during Early Access :)"

Very well done.","Oct 30, 2017 at 4:53 PM",5, 7,You made our day! Thank you so much. We can only hope to be that good one day!
2022-05-28 14:46:23.603804,SoundSilent,Great start,"I like the belt and equipment. I also liked how the shop and getting coins worked. Finally a game with some character building for VR.  I don't like the Y button used for teleport. I rather have right or left stick release for teleport depending on which hand. I don't like that it has smooth rotation on as default, I have to turn on 45 degree turn to not have motion sickness. I don't like that it doesn't have incremental teleport, I get sick moving around. Also which it had teleport grab, I think the game should even though the character isn't a magic user, teleport grab seem to be needed to make the game more smooth for the player.","Nov 4, 2017 at 2:44 PM",3, 2,"Thanks for the thumbs up! We will be coming out with more customization options during Early Access, what we have now is based on previous user feedback :) What we can never do unfortunately, unless Oculus Home allows us to hook into user preferences in the user profile, is to have a default that everyone is happy with."
2022-05-28 14:46:23.621755,rowski,RPGs,Although Karnage is worth making. Develops should not make motion controller rpgs. They should stick to the normal controllers so we can enjoy the 3D environment. The movement and waving a shield and a sword around frantically can make for motion sickness pretty fast. Might be suitable for children though.,"Nov 10, 2017 at 5:58 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 14:46:23.638710,Apohcalypse,,"Just got this game and played for a bit and I think it's great. Only problem I've run into so far is that I've gotten stuck a few times teleporting into an out of bounds type area and getting stuck. Otherwise, solid game with lots of potential.","Oct 28, 2017 at 9:21 AM",5, 10,"Happy to hear you enjoy playing Karnage. We think we know the problem you are experiencing and will be looking into it shortly. Thanks for mentioning it :)

UPDATE: From version 0.6.2.5 that went live Nov 3rd, the teleport issue should be fixed."
2022-05-28 14:46:26.747999,ChueyiCha,Not working for me/ Black screen,"I'm unable to get this game to work, I've only got it to work once, and that was waiting 30 min for the black screen to slowly turn into the game. It will eventually let me play after a long time of waiting, but I'm not waiting for half an hour every time I open the game. I have it installed on an SSD as well.","Nov 9, 2017 at 9:02 PM",1, 0,"Hi there ChueyiCha,

This is an interesting issue, usually the game loads in a few seconds. It may be a compatibility issue between steam VR and Oculus, have you tried disabling Steam VR before launching?

Another option would be to try to uninstall the game and re-install, there may have been some corruption on the download. Please keep us up to date with this issue, as if it is something on our side, we need to fix it!"
2022-05-28 14:46:26.766948,turkkam,Early access,"I hope this will get better because at current state i didn't enjoy the game at all.
My primary problem was with the combat, you just fling your sword frantically which requires no skill.","Nov 16, 2017 at 2:56 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 14:46:26.784900,Fuzzydragon,Impressive.,"graphics are way abouve par, enviroments are lively like your standing in a Blizzard game. deffinetly on par with The Mages Tale as a quality dungeon crawler and with some reasonable length of play time.","Nov 6, 2017 at 11:25 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:46:26.804847,WadeGR,Very Well Done,Way to go Nordic Trolls! Excellent game with great combat mechanics. Last boss was a lot of fun! Can't wait for more content. Hoping for mage class as well as a sneak thief class complete with stealth attacks and throwing knives. Keep up the great work!,"Oct 30, 2017 at 9:22 AM",5, 5,Thanks! Sounds like you managed to beat the Corrupted Troll :)

Its still an early access, thumbs up! worth a buy if you like aRPG","Nov 1, 2017 at 8:55 AM",3, 2,Thanks for the thumbs up! We do have plans to rewrite the A.I. during Early Access :) UPDATE: The AI is rewritten.
2022-05-28 14:46:29.950034,Cryptogene,First time getting motion sickness in VR,"& the honors go toooo.. You guessed it. Perhaps if the walking mechanics wern't like driving a tank while swiveling your head, my body wouldn't be so tripped out. But hey maybe it's just me ?","Nov 3, 2017 at 11:19 PM",3, 5,"Hey! Just curious if you tried out the different modes of locomotion, and also tried switching between HMD tracked and Controller tracked locomotion? They can be found in Settings --> Controller Options (accessed from the belt in-game). Turning off controller strafing also seems to be useful to some :)"
