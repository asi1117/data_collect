And my touch controls do work in other apps and games","Dec 15, 2019 at 5:39 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:49:49.534062,Rift8299292,Remove from the store,"Does not a support a controller so cannot be started.
Remove this from the store or update it to work because it looked alright (for a free, 5 minute experience)","Apr 6, 2019 at 3:06 AM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 19:49:49.567972,FastLawyer,One fact that made it 3 stars for me,"I learned that wealthy Romans would put toilets in the kitchen.  If you don't believe me, download this app and check it out for yourself.","Feb 9, 2018 at 3:51 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:49:49.588915,phoenixbyrd,,"Interesting experience, was hoping it was more in depth so I could use it for homeschool purposes. Still usefull to give my kids a sense of presence in what it was like inside a Roman period home.  Would love to see this developed more, perhaps exploring outside the Roman home and seeing things like a marketplace or more places that would be more common to the average Roman citizens daily lives.","Dec 8, 2017 at 6:32 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:49:52.720659,Aden777,Decent,Kinda neat. I can't rate it too hard considering the price. Graphics are ok.,"Oct 20, 2017 at 8:19 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:49:52.734621,nightcat.mau,Good Tour!,"While not realistic in the graphics, this is a good tour and might even be nice for meditation. You can clip through walls and objects quite often and that should be fixed.","Sep 19, 2017 at 5:47 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:49:52.750087,neuro27,Another VR Museum,"This is another take on the VR Museum, like others that came before it such as Boulevard, Native American App, and Mocove Arts. This app improves upon the others by providing fitting ambient music that compliments the scene you explore. Instead of exploring a museum with pieces, you explore an actual Roman house with a narrator that provides explanations. The narrator is text-to-speech, but a fairly convincing one and does not distract from the experience too much. It assumes you will explore the house in a certain order (calling certain things as ""this is the third..."") without guiding you in that order in any obvious way. You can get through all the content of this app within 20 minutes and come out with a better understanding of life in Ancient Roman times. Overall, I recommend it if you're interested in history, but not otherwise. The graphics and 3D models are not high resolution enough to really impress any but the truly curious.","Jun 21, 2017 at 11:09 AM",3, 1,"Thanks for your review!
Your notes will really be important for perfecting our future projects."

It is really important to us in order to improve our products."
2022-05-28 19:49:55.884282,dottedfish,Decent but made me doubt,"did roman houses really have fountains in them? Yes, the impluvium often had a shallow pool sunk into the floor to catch the rainwater - but the self feeding fountain made me doubt the historical accuracy of this experience.","Jun 24, 2017 at 7:03 AM",2, 1,"Thanks for your review!
Some domus actually had fountains in their gardens. 
Although it is not a very common feature, you can find some examples at Pompeii and Herculaneum."
