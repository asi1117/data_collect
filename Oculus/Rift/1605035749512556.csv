I would rate this higher if it wasn't for the ticket system in the beginning. 47% into the game i dropped the ticket in the slot to start playing, realizing it was were you delete your profile.

2022-05-28 15:35:18.500919,Fishinruss,Ghost watching,This is a great movie concept that I want to see more of! So to start of its an island and you pick and choose who you want to follow and watch. Or you can just roam freely and examine the scenery. With every character having individual stories tied to the movie that you can discover by following other characters. Which is a cool concept with plenty of room for ideas. There are plenty of shows that do this multilayered story telling and this vr experience is probably the coolest way to see it. With it being about I’d say 20-35 mins long it has lots of replay ability to see other characters perspectives. You will find yourself rewatching and following characters which means you essentially get a much longer and enjoyable experience watching it from the perspective you choose! The hardest part is loving it and discovering there’s very few that tell vr stories like this. Hope to see more.,Oct 8 at 9:32 PM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:35:18.517873,DelapierceD,Absolutely Amazing!,"If you are at all into mystery stories, and/or appreciate Tesla and hate Edison, then this is a must. Like Clue, but drama instead of comedy. There is also a ""true"" ending that requires more than just watching. Really awesome, and I want more like it!","Jan 9, 2021 at 11:52 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:35:21.625562,Alicia_Wonderland,Amazing! Loved it!,"This was such a cool experience following each character around and learning more about them and their secrets while exploring all the nooks and crannies of the house. The acting was incredible, I would have liked to see end credits to see who the actors were. Wondering if it was mocap or purely animation, the movements were very realistic for a VR game.

The immersion is incredible, getting close-up views of each character at multiple angles, exploring the house and grounds, you lose track of time so hours really do become invisible lol. I think I spent about 10-12 hours in this (but still didn’t find all the diaries!)

I’m giving this 5 stars because it was so amazing and I’d like to see more games like this but I do have a couple of issues. It doesn’t save your progress between sessions, it starts you over from scratch but you can jump into the next chapter anyway, but it’s harder to find where the characters are. And don’t even bother to look for the diaries, photos and letters until your last session because that will all be lost. Also, although I understood the surprise twist ending, it ended rather abruptly and I wanted to know more, what happens next... It left me with more questions than answers. 

But all in all, I think it’s well worth the money and although there really isn’t any replayability, the scenery is so cool and the rain sound is so great, I may go back to just stand there listening to the rain and getting lost goth romantic views...","Nov 30, 2020 at 1:23 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 15:35:24.787107,Skuggfax,Truly amazing,"A mix between a game, a movie and a play. What a brilliant concept! This murder mysetery is filled with side stories and plot twists left and right. It keeps you engaged watching the story unfold and exploring the areas looking for clues to figgure out who the murderer is. It starts off in one way and the story morphs in a way you could never even imagine. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes a thrilling mystery.","Aug 7, 2019 at 4:58 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:35:24.802066,ChurchYo,Just please tweak the last 20 seconds...,"Others have written for or against the plot, the mechanics, the characters, and the other things, so i won't bother with redundancy. 

That said, the ending didn't feel like an ending at all. In fact, i was so unsure of it being the end, that i continued playing the game for another 30 minutes trying to figure out if i had missed something. I played through for about 5 hours, hours i thoroughly enjoyed, experiencing a story in an entirely unique manner. However, the *bang* someone gets at the end of a game, book, or movie, was not well executed. 

**SPOILER BELOW**

Finally, what the hell happened to the murderer? He/she walked into the next room over, and then dissapeared from existence? No write off, no death, nothing. The murderers role towards the end is arguably the most important thing to tie it all together and the writers properly pissed it away. At the very least let us follow him/her back down to the time machine and watch them teleport into oblivion. Then give us a message saying the game is over, but we're free to continue chasing completion of the ticket.

That aside, very cool experience.","Jun 27, 2019 at 3:26 PM",4, 4,

Loaded it up not expecting much but I loved it. Absolutely gripping storyline and a fascinating cast of characters. Completed it over a weekend, probably took about 4 or 5 hours. It's a passive experience, you're just watching a tale unfold, but its full of twists and turns and kept me entertained throughout. Definitely worth a play through.","Dec 27, 2018 at 1:28 AM",5, 13,

It's not a game as such but a peice of theatre where you are the spectator exploring each character when left on their on figuring out the peices of the puzzle. I also liked exp,oring the vast mansion as it's all really nicely done. This is just a nice break if you don't feel like shooting stuff or hurting your brain with complex puzzles etc. As I said it's really well done, I don't think the trailer sold it to me but really glad I got this.

The idea is OK, this is more in depth than a linear movie, since you can follow each person's Point Of View, fast forward or go backwards in time. It's not going to be a summer block buster.

Know this before you go off buying this game. I bought this on a pack so I didnt really know what to expect from it and I must say I was really dissapointed. I read some comments on this game and they all made it seem like an adventure detective type of game, so I was really suprised and sad when I found out all you do is sit and watch for a couple of hours. Still cant understand why its so highly rated... Instead of sitting in a chair watching this for hours you can go watch an actual movie instead. Overated and overpriced.

2022-05-28 15:35:34.290687,mishka11,Gorgeous. Truly Unique and Immersive,"There are no words to describe the expereince of this ""game."" Its not really a game ...though it can be as interactive or relaxed as you'd like. The environment and gamepplay is so intriguing, that within the frist 10mins of the game, I found myself pausing the scene and exploring every square inch of Tesla's mansion. 

Finding all the notes and diary entries is part of the interactive options ...reading the story in parts to piece together the back stories of all the characters involved really pulls you in. And walking through all the rooms and seeing where each person is placed within the timeline of the scene is part of the unique beauty of this adventure and story. Of course, you could just watch as a third-person passive observer...though that would miss out on the beauty and immersiveness of the story.

This is one of the rare gems in the VR store that creates a lasting impression and forever-memories. People who prefer the art of mental awareness and enjoy taking their time with centered presence will thoroughly appreciate this one.","Jun 29, 2018 at 6:01 AM",5, 11,

All the characters have great depth, and there are some very suspensful moments! I think this game is worth $14.99, no more. I got 4/5 hours of content out of it. Although the voiceovers are great, and actually the characters have great body language too, sometimes, especially when violence is happening, I think there could have been more work done to make things look like a struggle.

So it's neither a game nor a movie, but more like an interactive viewer that can appear anywhere you choose within the story and this way experience different things. Depending on what persons you choice to follow on what times, your perception of everything may change, who may be the murder and why... and also, an additional mystery-scifi aspect of the story makes it even more interesting. Truely, even though I kinda thought of one part of the mystery behind Tesla, I didn't expect the end to unfold like this. Btw, you should look also for the secret ending!","May 23, 2018 at 8:33 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:35:40.629732,TheMarc,Very disappointing,"This was very disappointing. A solid game mechanic and great idea is let down by poor voice acting and terrible editing. There are strange long gaps in time between people speaking, completely breaking immersion. Moreover, you cannot really fast forward through the speech, because you will miss important plot points, so you are stuck with dealing with characters who act like they have recently been brain damaged.

This is light on actual gameplay, and more about seeing how the narrative unfolds around each character. The acting is strong. Only giving it 4 stars, because I feel like the presentation and cryptic nature of how you progress through the game wasn't properly explained.

If you are into mystery, particularly Agatha Christie/Hitchcock style, This experience is for you. I also would highly recommend it to those seeking more of a passive, relaxed VR experience as this can be done seated easily (I'd recommend messing a bit with the height so sitting down feels more natural). If you are seeking a more active mystery experience, this is not for you, but this was despite its passiveness one of my favorite VR experiences so far. It also lasts a good amount of time (for me probably around 6-7 hours, although it can be done in 5-6) although does not have much replayability once you've seen everything.","Mar 30, 2018 at 4:18 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:35:46.913924,PoolfanVr,Not a game but a unique experience,"This is actually a piece of theatre not a game - essentially you are a fly on the wall witnessing the events around a murder, but where it differs from a play or film is that you can choose to follow one character and see what they are up to and then switch when something else catches your interest.  The key thing though is that you can rewind and fast forward through time and jump into the story at any point.  

What makes it work is that the characters are very interesting (actually most of them are based around real people) and the acting is excellent. The story is engaging and you really want to find out more and more.  The game is set around a large mansion and it is fun to explore and although you cannot really influence anything you can pick up selected objects and look for clues that flesh the story out further.

If you like a murder mystery then I highly recommend it.  I'd look for it on a discount as one thing that struck me once I had finished it is that it has no replay appeal.","Mar 31, 2018 at 6:41 PM",4, 10,

2022-05-28 15:35:50.113367,FastLawyer,Murder she wrote ... badly,"I'm really surprised by all the 5 star reviews for this title.  Don't get me wrong.  I think The Invisible Hours is a great idea, but it's poorly executed.  There's lots of ambition in this innovative VR experience.  I expect this formula will be stolen by other developers who will expand and improve on this new format for story-telling.  The problem is that the writing is mediocre.  Tesla was murdered and you arrive with a house full of suspects.  A VR murder mystery.  You get to see different viewpoints from all around the house, after the murder.  You get to see what each person was doing at different times by rewinding time, pausing time, or going fast forward.  That would all be great if the writing was so good that you felt engrossed by each plot and subplot that you would intentionally investigate each character's comings and goings and conversations.  Instead, it felt like a chore.  The dialogues between the characters just felt thin.  I honestly never cared who murdered Tesla.  Part of the problem, I think, is that Tesla is painted not as a man of science, but as some guy who fell into some alien technology by apparently time-travelling.  He feels like a caricature who did things for apparently no reason.  My problem is that I was at the right character when a second murder happened.  So I saw it happen.  It ruined any suspense this murder mystery might have had.  And yes, the murderer was exactly who I had most suspected.  The problem was this whole McGuffin of a plot where Tesla had to invite all these guests to his house so that we would have a house full of guests.  They all act in devious and guilty manners.  They are all liars, well, maybe except for one.  The first person to confess, even if falsely.  Still, it seems these subplots are tangential at best and are only in there to muddy the waters.  It all feels too campy.  Again, I saw the second murder take place.  Why go on with this mystery?  And the ending ... WTF?  That's the real mystery.","Dec 19, 2017 at 3:24 PM",3, 7,

The best way I can describe it is murder mystery stage play, but you're omnipresent. You can learn a lot more about these characters and their lives than you would be able to in a play or book. I felt like a fly on the wall in the best way. That doesn't really do it justice, but that's the gist of how it felt for me.

I noticed and appreciated a lot of small details--little things like the way cloth moved, the animations of the characters when walking up and down stairs, etc. I especially liked all the ""throwaway"" lines of the characters I followed, and I like knowing that there's even more lore in the other character stories if I replay it in the future.

The amount of threads going on at once and the way in which you find yourself compelled to follow each and every character’s individual storyline is irresistible.  However, there are some minor gripes; I would have preferred an option to freely move using the left stick while also utilising the teleportation provided (Killing Floor Incursion is a superb example of this) and don’t even think about firing this thing up unless you have the Oculus Tray Tool to crank up the supersampling to 2.0 because the graphics are awful at the default; as blurry as hell.  The only in game graphics option is ‘Quality’ which, when set to Ultra does nothing for the clarity; they need to include in-game supersampling options for those not accustomed to fiddling via tools such as the Oculus Tray Tool (if you are one of those not yet acquainted, then download it and create a profile for the game, set the supersampling to 2.0 if your system can take it and you’re good to go; it really is unwatchable without the extra boost to the clarity…).","Jan 3, 2018 at 5:48 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:35:56.420498,RC_IN_VR,Outstanding Experience But Needs Closure,"If you ever wanted to be inside a murder mystery, this VR experience is for you.  Four stars is giving it 80% and that would have been doing this an injustice.  However, 100% is a touch generous.  When all of the character's threads play out, one is left wondering if he missed something.  A murder mystery engenders the Poirot-esque expectation of a final, gathering of suspects, see if I was right, catch the killer, AH HA! moment, which does not happen here.  What makes the absence of that more regrettable is that it would have taken very little additional material on the part of the developers to provide it.  Instead the player/viewer is given the answers to all of his questions as he views the final chapter for each character, and only slowly does he become aware that the party is over.  It is sort of like an awkward pause at the end of a conversation, when we are not quite sure if the other person is done and want to make certain we don't walk away while there is more to be said.  That said, (see what I did there) this is superbly acted and put together.  The mechanics and controls are exactly what they should be. It is soundly entertaining and well worth buying, especially if purchased at a sale price.  A humble suggestion: set aside 4-5 hours and go through it in a single sitting when you have an evening to kill (no pun intended).  OK, yes it was.  I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing what this developer does in the future.","Dec 31, 2017 at 4:28 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:35:56.436455,kamiklase,Great experience but still a question,"What I love the most is that you hear voices in the background and you cannot decide to follow the story you are watching or stop and move to the other persons to see what is happening. The feeling that you miss something important. This is so different to watching a movie on your TV.
My tip is to follow the story till the end of chapter 2 and then go looking for clues in e-mails and diaries. This make the story more complex and exciting. In chapter 3 you need the extra information that you find in the house.  
I do not know where Flora went. You see her at the end of ""first"" chapter, but at the beginning of the next chapter she is gone. I do not tell which chapter, for the people that did not finish the experience.","Jan 1, 2018 at 10:16 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:35:56.452412,Fwak,Awesome!,"Like watching a play/film with multiple storylines happening at once. Whats really cool is how who you choose to follow and in what order affects your understanding of the story. You might get a fair way through the story, then choose to return to an earlier point to observe someone you missed the first time round, and witness an ""OMG!"" moment that totally changes everything you thought about what happened subsequently. Or happen to be in the right place at the right time to see something where you think ""Christ! If I hadn't spotted that I'd have gone on totally unaware that..."". Well written, well voice acted, great characters and really interesting. I see what some people say about faces being blurry at a distance but it in no way diminishes the experience. Only sad thing is once you get to the end and see everything you cant unwatch it and forget it all in order to discover it anew again, but thats murder mystery for you. Trying not to rush through it as really loving it. Well worth it!","Dec 17, 2017 at 1:51 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:35:56.469367,phoenixdigital,A unique VR experience,"I picked this up just a few days ago and I am very glad I did. The concept intrigued me and it works incredibly well in VR.

This experience definitely wont be something that many ""gamers"" will likely enjoy. It even says upfront that ""This is not a game. This is a theatrical performance or play"" So be fully aware of that going in. The acting is pretty top notch too. In other games the voice actors seem a bit flat. Might be something to do with the fact I think they were acting in the same room as each other with mocap suits on. That and they picked a solid cast.

Without giving any spoilers think of it as a murder mystery where you can fast forward and rewind time and move to any point and place in the story. The beauty of this is there are storylines playing out all across the entire environment. So you may follow one character for Act 1, 2, 3 and 4. But there is a whole other plot line going on in another room with different characters. All contributing to the main story line. So essentially you have to watch each Act from each characters perspective to get the full story.

For those buying it I have heard the best way to watch it is to follow a character for each act then rewind and watch the same act through another characters perspective. It means you might end up going through each Act multiple times.

I had heard of people going through all 4 Acts from one characters perspective then starting from Act 1 again from another characters viewpoint. I think it would work quite well but there is a lot going on so I suspect they broke it up into 4 Acts to make it easier to keep track of who is doing what and what is being said between characters.

Final recommendation I have read and I agree with it. Don't keep rewinding trying to watch all storylines in parallel. I don't think it will work as effectively or be as rewarding an experience.

Top quality experience and I hope they make more of them.","Dec 17, 2017 at 8:20 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:35:56.484327,Axon_Potential,The Devil is in the detail,"The Invisible Hours is a highly intricate and drama-centric web of interwoven character profiles. Each personality that you choose to follow has a highly captivating story from start-to-end of the four chapters. The immersion of VR brings cluedo to life. Each individual within Tesla's manor has their own motive / agenda, and as an observer, I was able to freely manoeuvre the manor and eavesdrop into any conversation or action sequence of my choosing. I experienced a spectrum of personal emotions, and was also able to empathize with the emotions of the characters. The facial and movement animations were believeable. My only minor gripe was the slight blur experienced at a short distance (caused by the Unreal Engine's antialiasing), but this can easily be forgiven and somewhat remedied by setting the graphics to Ultra and increasing the Supersampling to 1.5 or above. All in all, an incredible VR experience that lasts a minimum of 5 hours and does not overstay its welcome!","Dec 18, 2017 at 8:39 PM",5, 4,

You can go anywhere on the island or Mansion. There are a lot of little clues scattered around. Each character has there own story you can follow. It's really good for being the first of its kind. I think that in the future if they put more detail it will create more immersive experience. If you hang around one character enough they will just start stairing at the wall or just walk in circles because their story is over but the scene is continuing. It would of being interesting if they could fill up all the time regardless if it was realted to the story, since in real life not everything is important. But I understand that takes a lot of work.

If you do what I did, which is to follow all characters in each chapter before moving on to the next chapter, it reduces a bit of the mystery and gives you an omniscience that reduces the impact of characters' limited knowledge and choices. I'd give an ordered list of which characters to follow first through last, but that would spoil which ones are most interesting or valuable. They're all unique and interesting and meaningful.

Or just do whataver you want, because you can. I spent a LONG time just staking out an umbrella, for instance. Because I could. Alternatively, just stake out a single room for all chapters to see the story from that one room's perspective.
