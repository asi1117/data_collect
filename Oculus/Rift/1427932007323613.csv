2022-05-28 16:17:41.856917,Muatok,Currently unplayable,"It looks like a Game I would enjoy though I've not been able to play since I bought it. The start screen loads fine but as soon as it loads the first lvl it drops stereo and goes flat very disorienting. Hardware 4ghz i5, GTX970, 32g ram. Edit... Played around a bit more discovered it's the planet/lvl select that causes it once you make a selection (very difficult without depth perception) it goes back to 3d you remove the planet to reselect and it goes flat, when you load the lvl it plays fine no issue seems to just be the lvl selection anamation.","Jul 20, 2020 at 1:12 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 16:17:41.871878,CabbageYES,Screen goes flat and not 3D,"Like all other comments that dates 9 months back. I experienced the same problem with animation turning flat. The game holds great potential, but this bug hasn't been fixed after everyone complaining in the comment section, devs you might as well take game down from Oculus store.","Jul 26, 2020 at 7:57 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 16:17:41.886838,Placentak,weird bug after 3 levels,"Hey devs, after playing 3 levels, the game started making a weird bug: the stereoscopy stopped working, all the perspectives became distorted. I tried rebooting, I have 100% battery, but it still does that (my pc: alienware r17, gtx0170, 16go Ram, i7). Any clue what could be causing that (it is of course unplayable in this state)?
graphics and universe are cool, gameplay: it's hard to hit a target with the gun (the one I could try in the 3 first level) or maybe it just lacks of visual or audio feedbacks when hitting a target.","Oct 30, 2019 at 10:09 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:17:41.900800,JohnnyLee,New version not as fun as old version.,"Latest version is a bit buggy. The ""Upgrade"" your spud option doesn't always work as nothing happens when you put a token in, set the spud on the upgrade machine and pull the lever. The spud just vanishes and goes back to where it was. 

The original version was more fun IMHO.","Sep 28, 2019 at 9:40 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 16:17:41.916758,HeyImHunter,Would be 5 stars but...,"When i launch the game sometimes it will be fine for a bit, but then it will give me a zoomed in veiw that i cant fix without restarting the game, if theres any way to fix this please let me know","Aug 18, 2019 at 4:35 AM",4, 2,"Hi HeyImHunter! We are looking into it right now, will be fixing it with next update once we find a reproduction of the bug."

2022-05-28 16:17:45.068328,DaPizzaCannibal,This game is great but I have some Ideas,"This game is great Its fun but I have some ideas you could add in the game
1. Needs more characters, but I have beaten a few planets, so there could be more than I think.
2. I would love to be able to play as one of your men during battle in first person.
3. Add money so you can upgrade your men so they are more powerful.
But over all, I love this game.  It's super fun.","Apr 6, 2019 at 1:51 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:17:45.083288,T-Maxx,"Love this game!  But,,,","I love this game.  Great visuals, great game play.  It's fun, exciting, and will keep you moving.  But still buggy.  I have tanks that cannot retrun from a mission and planes that freeze in mid air.  All the while, I continue to be attacked.  I wish the bugs affected the enemy.  Still, in time, I beleive this will become a five star game.","Feb 19, 2019 at 8:42 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:17:45.098248,Boneduster987,No longer a waste of 20 bucks,"some bugs fixed and a tutorial  has made a huge diffence so i have done a update to my review. from 1 star to 5. The response i got from a dev about my first review really shows they care.  These devs are truely amazing. 

They need to add to tutorial what the different spuds do how to launch vehicals never knew you had to put a spud in a vehical thought they were bugged and a lvl system for the spuds would be nice as well and some type and ranking reward system is needed but are in the works.  

Once again its still a early release and is a  very fun game. From a game so buggy i couldnt even start a match to what it is now I must say it is a must have and can see game becoming a big hit on psvr and other systems with a little more work.  Buy it asap and go conquere the universe.","Jan 22, 2019 at 2:38 AM",5, 8,"Thanks for your support! We work to be as responsive as possible to create a unique genre and VR environment together ;)

My Thoughts:
For me to give this early access title a 4 star rating on the Oculus store must mean it's something really special. The game is super polished and ticks all the right boxes.
This is a tower defense style game with some of the best customisation I have seen in this genre, the ability to customise everything from your troops, buildings and weapons is superb and once you get over the steep learning curve this is really satisfying and a blast to play.
My only gripe would be the basic text-over tutorials. It took me over an hour to learn how to play and at times felt a little frustrating.
So I hope the developers add hands-on tutorials to help better teach you the game.","Jan 28, 2019 at 2:54 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 16:17:48.251813,SDC3,getting into battle - what!?! HOW! HELP!,"PLEASE HELP! Kindly help us get into battle.  Our spaceship enters ""blackhole"" but ends up back to our lair.","Jan 20, 2019 at 4:36 AM",5, 1,"Hello SDC3,
as for the traveling system - you can reach other destinations dependent on the planet you've chosen. All of the green and other color planets/meteors are battlefields, and ""Blackhole"" in the middle of the planetary system leads to another system.

If that resolved your problem - we're glad to see you enjoying Spuds Unearthed. If you would like to specify the issue - write us back at hello@spudsunearthed.com - we'll write back with a solution ASAP."

As it’s still in early access, features will be developed in the future, but you can already feel the vibe of spud galaxy.
