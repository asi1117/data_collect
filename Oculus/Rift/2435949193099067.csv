2022-05-28 19:28:59.583166,TomA07,Run Feature,"So basically, my idea is that your able to run with a keybind like maybe you hold left stick in while moving or something easy like that. It would be useful for everything, making covers easier, running from point to point and running up to spike. It would overall make the game more fun and create more plays and rallys. This is all just my opinion though, hope you like the idea.",Jul 3 at 9:52 AM,4, 6,

You can find it by searching for Volleyball Fever and then going to App Lab.
2022-05-28 19:28:59.614083,ItzGator,Helpful note,"So when you turn jump mode on it helps so you dont have to jump in real life. But the thing is it puts right in the air. so that means like instead of it just spawning you in the air when you use jump, just make like a accual jump where you slowly go up and then come back down.","Dec 29, 2020 at 7:38 AM",4, 1,That's great feedback! I'll add a smooth and animated jump in a future update. It'll be optional. If you have more requests or just want to chat about the game just drop me an email: feedback@neuston.io
2022-05-28 19:28:59.630040,Grief_Sorrow,Room for Improvement.,"I'm just going to dive in.  The game is well thought out and made but there are some areas in need of help. First, I'm starting with this one due to my frustration with it, when the player is in the front line the bot aside or behind you act like your not there and try to get the ball. When this happens they leave their area wide open and often points are scored agaist the player's team. I suggest a barrier is made for the player so that the bot dont leave their specific area. Second, I find the game too easy. The opposing team doesn't spike often and their receives are often laughable. Most points that are scored against the player, are from their own mistakes or from my first critque I made. this next one may be my fault, but it seems as if multiplier isn't running or perhaps there is nobody else in multiplayer with you. I typically receive an error and have to quit the game. This next one isnt really a problem but others might find this bad. It seems as if the Player is unable to hit the ball out of bounds. Like I said, not really a problem but some might want the choice to turn that to make the game harder. Something I would like to see in the game is being able to free roam. Maybe not the whole court but a box, 1/4 of the Player's team's half of the court. That would allow for a better chance at getting balls. Overall its a fine game but a diffuculty change and my first point would be my upmost concerns. Thank you, happy to discuss. :)","Dec 15, 2019 at 5:38 AM",3, 3,"Hey Grief_Sorrow!

All points are valid concerns, and I therefore hope you'll find the latest update an improvement.

It's now possible to change the bot skill to pro (which means they no longer do extreme failures and they can jump block).

Multiplayer is a tricky thing, as it requires players to be online at the exact same time as someone else. The community is steadily growing so it'll get better, but right now I recommend that you join the community on Discord, there are usually people there looking for people to play with. https://discord.gg/uX3byH.

It's now possible to toggle aim assist on or off, to make it possible to get more control over the ball (it requires more skill of course).

That, and a ton of improvements such as physical net that moves on ball impact, are available right now. I hope you'll enjoy it :).

2022-05-28 19:28:59.645000,YeezyJumpex,"Great idea, but needs some improvement","I love volleyball, so I was excited to see an actual attempt at the sport in volleyball. One major thing that is missing though is the ability to jump in game. Playing for a few minutes I have already hit my ceiling a few times with the controller from instinctively jumping. Adding a button to jump would make the game feel a lot more satisfying (at least in my opinion). Other than that, I only have small critiques such as possibly enabling rotation using the joystick and then maybe a harder mode where the ball doesn't automatically go up when you hit it. Overall, I applaud the efforts of trying to make a volleyball game, and I can see that the developers are really passionate at trying to make this game great.","Sep 16, 2019 at 3:34 AM",3, 2,"Hey YeezyJumpex!

Since this review, there have been huge improvements. It's now possible to jump by clicking a button, and you can change the bot skill and turn off aim assist if you want to have more control and a tougher challenge. Oh, and you can also rotate using the joystick now. Let me know if you have more feedback. We also have a great community at Discord if you want to discuss things directly: https://discord.gg/uX3byH"
