2022-05-28 19:17:11.978754,ShadowMann,What a great coaster! A story coaster.,"I love this rollercoaster. You are Thor, and Loki steals your hammer and you chase him through a fantastical VR environment. The graphics are great and the story element makes the coaster just that more fun. For me, it was the closest to a real life major theme park rollercoaster I have experienced in VR. Like the sort of theme park signature rollercoaster you might wait in line for 30 minutes to ride. Great to re-ride too!","Jul 18, 2019 at 3:36 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:17:11.994712,joseph.williams.7777,Getting this game to work is tricky.,"At first i had trouble getting this game to work, The secret is to point the touchpad at startscreen, fire the lazer, but use another button at the same time your firing your lazer. The second button you need to press on the same remote ain't a-b or restart. It might be rl pessed at the same time as lb button, also known as the lazor button. At first i thought the game was broken, but it wasn't. :)","Apr 15, 2019 at 12:08 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:17:12.009672,lataraoxalic,Won't start!,"I've downloaded and played many apps here.  This is the first that opens to the 'START' and when I fire the lazers to start, it say that I'm playing but nothing changes.  I'm still at the beginning.  The  'CHALLENGE' says 'locked' in red letters. Nothing.... although the board says it's running.  Guess I'll ask for a refund even though I do like to help these developers.  Very disappointed.","Jan 18, 2019 at 11:38 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:17:12.025629,lefthome,Something missing.. no sensation. UPDATE,"Great graphics and atmosphere, but this doesn't feel like riding a coaster at all. It's like watching a movie of what it's like to ride a roller coaster. There is no sense of gravity or momentum. No physics. After playing 'Aircar' (a free experience) and being able to turn my stomach in loops, I expected more from this.

I will not refund because I believe in supporting the developers and perhaps it can be enhanced in updates, but as it stands now I cannot recommend.

UPDATE: I have demonstrated this for several people and some of them really get a kick out of it. It seems to affect some people way more than others, and the ones that are affected by the motion have a lot of fun. I'm updating my review to 4 stars to be fair. It wasn't my cup of tea, but it is high quality. I have gotten my money's worth watching others have a ball with it.","Aug 10, 2018 at 9:59 AM",4, 9,
