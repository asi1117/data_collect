2022-05-28 19:38:38.277686,thermite1338,Never played a worse VR game.,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONNEY ON THIS GAME!!! The controlls are weird and unintuative, the graphics melted my eyes the dog walks in to you constantly blocking your path and he whines constantly, and it gets loud, like to the point to which I had to take off my headset and manually turn down the volume on my computer. You cant step inside of any of the guidance circles with the joysticks. It seems like the developers expect everyone to have an insane 360 degree tracking setup because moving the view with the joysticks is insanely slow. Again the controlls are so unintuative that i thought my game was broken, when you get instructions in the beginning tutorial they all blend together in to a jumbled mess. I actually think I had a more immersive experience in Butts VR. Not to mention that it glitched out and i think it blew out one of my headphones on my oculus. The developers clearly did not put a lot of effort in to it i think that a lot of my fellow classmates from PCC could whip up a game of about the same level in a week. As someone who owns very real firearms the shooting mechanics are insane, i found that its easier to hold the gun and move it back as far as you can to the point where you have gone through the scope so you can see the iron sight and use that to shoot. It earrapes all of the time and it feels like these developers couldnt decide in between a sniper game or a standard shooter. Let me give you what we call a pro tip developers, usually the snipers are the people who don't enjoy being in close combat (crazy right?). Back to the controlls. No one uses triggers to grab things, not in a single other VR game I have played, it made me wonder if any of the devs had even worn an oculus. Oh and heres a big thing! YOU CANT PRESS Y WHILE HOLDING LEFT JOYSTICK YOU DOLTS. I wouldnt be suprised if this game did not go through any proofing anywhere in the process of its production. They added an insane aim compensator and that still doesnt make it any easier to play.","Jun 14, 2020 at 1:00 AM",1, 8,"Hello, Thank you for the feedback. We will look into it and 
improve our game as much as possible. As per your comments 
regarding the controls of the game we have kept it realistic 
as much as possible to provide a realistic sniping experience
in the game. I know it is bit complicated, but even shooting a
sniper has never been so easy in real life. For dog... he
is just there to love you, and thats why he follows you
around, share some love dude.... Adding to it you can grab
items by using grip button on the controller, and 
somethings in the game can be interacted through trigger
button."
2022-05-28 19:38:38.292646,Dj_Reb,Decent,"This is a pretty fun VR game with interesting missions. The player area could have movement perhaps, although the current space is fine if we dodge the bullets properly. Overall, a decent game.","Sep 29, 2020 at 11:23 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:38:38.307606,triborg1024,amazing,"you might say that the scope is bad cause you cant zoom in just hold the movement button up to zoom in anyway back to the story:the game is outstanding 5 stars not for the scenery but how the sniper works to its not 3 stars like people are giving it, either they were doing it wrong or somthing else","May 9, 2020 at 11:12 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:38:38.322566,wperdigao,Super clunky experience,Takes way too long to just figure out how to start the mission. Then the aiming to kill your enemies is all over the place. Not being able to move is frustrating. You just get endlessly killed until you manage to figure out where the next shooter is. Just terrible gameplay in my opinion.,"Jun 17, 2019 at 9:37 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:38:38.337526,lindsey-robins,A game that will make you go crazy,"Start of the game is very exciting. It is fun to practice the game in the practice range, with various sniper rifle available in the game. Hideout looks OK, but when a player goes on a mission it is completely different game, and I just loved it. Hope game will be updated later, and the developers will solve minor problems in game.","May 10, 2019 at 1:32 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:38:41.444331,RobinWilliams,A perfect Birthday present,"Got this game as a gift on my birthday, and I was going crazy about it. Me and my friends enjoyed my birthday while playing this game, and it was a hell lot of fun.  This game just made my day.","May 28, 2019 at 3:54 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:38:41.461287,jfhtheman,"Crash, Crash, and more Crash",The game hasnt started once since I downloaded it. I have tried reinstalling and everything else I can think of.  It just will not run. One star because I have to give a star,"Feb 4, 2019 at 12:20 PM",1, 0,

2022-05-28 19:38:41.492203,fatalflu,When its not bugging out...,"Its fairly good shooter. your kinda planted in one area and your suppose take out a select number enemies in an area. Its kinda cool to be able to aim down the sight.
It would be a 4 star game, but I keep running into a bug where the gun just hovers in front of me I can grab it with one hand but not the other; the gun doesnt move when this happens and the only way to get it to act normal is to shoot.
There is one thing I really dont like though it doesnt matter where you aim at an  enemy, as long as they are in your sight it kills them.  Example I was aiming for a head shot and they got shot in the chest. 
(The devs fix some issues I'll change my rating)","Jun 22, 2018 at 6:38 AM",3, 7,
