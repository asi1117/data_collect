2022-05-28 19:31:30.875607,Oldmancrazy,I'm dumb...,"... so this thing is useless to me but its still cool to see it got made and its probably being used.  Would be really good for things like teaching science or biology or chemistry and the like.  Lots of little things you can do with the genes and strands.  Pretty cool, but heavy on the science imho.","Sep 13, 2020 at 8:59 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:31:30.890568,akuwardmoments,I can see myself using this in academia,"This is a fantastic tool for studying, teaching myself and others, and even conducting a bit of my own research. I definitely plan to get an academic license for this.

For my purposes, incorporating more physical and chemical concepts would be extremely useful for electrochemical simulations to aid my real-life experiments. The biggest of these being intermolecular and surface forces. 

I'm really looking forward to seeing where this goes. Matryx, the addition of other concepts, and all. Fantastic work!","Jan 18, 2019 at 1:30 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 19:31:30.905527,westworldDroid,A humble beginning to a big app,"This type of apps are going to be huge and probably just part of our day to day lives in the future, Nanome team did a great job on making a user-friendly and detailed chemistry and molecular structure visualization app that has some cool features. 
I am working on a visualization app and I like what they are doing with this. Hopefully this type of app interests users into learning more about the real world and not just virtual world.","Dec 16, 2018 at 6:57 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 19:31:30.924478,Good_Days13,Educational,"This made me look into proteins and learn more about them, even though I'm only in 7th grade.","Nov 27, 2018 at 8:03 PM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 19:31:30.946418,JOC26,The only reason I use VR,"Apps like Nanome are the only reason I use VR. I am no biochemist, etc., but the value of having actually been inside a molecule cannot be understated. I have spoken with professors that love Nanome for educational purposes, and are trying to get this used in their University. This YT video says it all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrdpHPAbi48","Jan 25, 2019 at 11:09 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 19:31:34.060201,mastersacademy,WoW. This is a fantastic app,This is an amazing and powerful app for teaching molecular science! Love it!,"Nov 24, 2018 at 6:01 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:31:34.076158,rchrdcrg,Not a learning tool; subscription based.,"Sadly, this is one of those bougie science/medical apps that requires a sign-in just to try it for free, and doing anything of value requires a subscription. It's sad that so many of these scientific apps focus on monetization and not on education. As other reviews say, perfect for biotechs and such, maybe worth it to them, but for the layperson looking to play around and maybe learn something, this is useless. Also, any VR app that requires me to remove the headset in order to set it up and use it instantly irritates me.","Sep 3, 2018 at 12:36 AM",1, 12,"Hi there. You can actually start exploring Nanome directly through the tutorial without having to create an account or remove your headset. We’re big believers in democratizing science and education, but in order to do so, we do need to pay our developers. The free version of Nanome was intended to inspire future scientists and power users, not impede their learning. We’re sorry you had a bad experience."
2022-05-28 19:31:34.091118,AdamGardner,,"It has what I would expect from a fully functional molecular viewer. Everything is polished and very easy to use. My complaints would be that I'm not a fan of the pay for features model (maybe there could be an academic use and a commercial use version?). A minor complaint, I couldn't figure out how to edit the surface transparency. Also if I didn't know PDB ids from heart I would have had trouble finding the molecules I wanted.","Sep 14, 2018 at 7:40 AM",4, 5,"Thanks for your kind words. We’re working on making the loading feature more intuitive. We’ll soon be adding a keyword search so that even if you don’t know the exact PDB code, you can still search the public databases. We created a quick tip video to show you how to change the surface transparency. You can access that video here: https://youtu.be/wtGj8a4GJnk One last note, academic discounts are available for the Professional Edition. Feel free to send a message to support@nanome.ai with the school you’re affiliated with and how you intend to use the software."

2022-05-28 19:31:34.121038,jeff.lovelace,Lobby doesn't work,"I log in (Lobby), Nanome spins its wheels then crashes out with an error.  Tutorial is ok but just not enough to make the sale.  At a minumum you should be able to load a pdb file (local or databse) and density (mtz) and stare at it (for free).  It sometimes places the molecule outside of my working area.  Need a way to grab and move the molecule closer even if you aren't close enough to actually grab with the hand.","Sep 11, 2018 at 11:05 PM",2, 1,"Jeff, sorry to hear that you’re having errors. Feel free to send us more info on the issue to support@nanome.ai and we can investigate further. The Personal (free) edition of Nanome allows anybody to load public PDBs from the RCSB website. R&D for density map support is already on our roadmap. Molecules and menus can be grabbed from afar if you aim at your target with your controller, press and hold on the grip button, and pull back on the joystick. We hope you’ll try again soon."
2022-05-28 19:31:37.203937,mranis11,Game Changing Visualizations,What this app allows you do is unlike anything that has come before it. The hands-on interactions with large molecular structures are simply amazing. Nanome are changing the way that science is done.,"Sep 6, 2018 at 11:25 AM",5, 8,Thanks for the support! Tell your friends.
2022-05-28 19:31:37.219894,AppleIsForYou,This is science,"If you are like me (a biotech), this is for you.","Sep 2, 2018 at 8:25 AM",5, 9,Hi there. We're glad that you are enjoying the software. We're actively working with enterprise customers to improve and add additional functionality to Nanome.
