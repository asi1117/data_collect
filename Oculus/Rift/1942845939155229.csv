2022-05-28 16:12:42.511038,Beans1985,Under rated,Truly one of the more underrated games out there. It’s truly a gem and I really loved it. Made me tear up so many times.,Jan 11 at 11:16 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:12:42.525001,Reefee,I loved it!,"I just love the idea of groundhog day and I am happy that this game lives up to the expectations. The way you fix things little by little is super satisfying and I am gladly giving it a 5 star, even before I have finished the game.","Dec 13, 2020 at 7:39 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:12:42.540958,Sanmi96,A life lesson,"Just like the movie, this game carries a beautiful message.
It has a lot of fun minigames on top to make it a truly captivating VR experience, plus the story will make you answer that question in your head:
""Is it comfortable to play VR while crying my eyes out?""
It is not.","Nov 10, 2020 at 8:59 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:12:42.554921,SwaDorgk,Satisfaction and Entertaining,"I enjoyed this VR so much. I wish there were more games like this. I was playing very comfortably for many hours. This game was straightforward and yet complex at the same time. If you're a fan of games such as Life is Strange, I think you will like this one.","Nov 24, 2020 at 5:42 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:12:45.699510,fenrirhun,Do try it,"Maybe watch the movie first, for those sweet callbacks and to double down on the life lessons.
Anyway, it is narrative-driven, has fun minigames, and is funny (actually laugh-out-loud funny, not just blow-air-through-your-nose funny). Plus you can put a good couple of hours in it, you're not paying for a half-four 'VR experience'.

All in all, a lovely game.","May 1, 2020 at 10:03 PM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 16:12:45.713473,Elanaitassil,Crashes,"The game seems excellent, but I keep getting random crashes. I'm currently at about 4-5 hours of gameplay, and the game crashed maybe 15 times. 
There doesn't seem to be any troubleshooting or any discussion on this subject on the internet so... I just have to endure it I guess. My computer is really good (around 2000€ worth) and only 3 months old so this is really bugging me. I don't have any trouble with other games so...","Jun 11, 2020 at 1:12 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 16:12:45.744391,FeedMeMemesPlz,Main Menu Broken and Can't Proceed,After starting the game and waiting through the way too long begining I finally get to start the game. Except I can't. Hands are stuck in random locations and can only rotate. Unluckily both times my hands were stuck in a position that did not allow me to actually start the game and see if the problem persisted beyond the main menu. Doesn't matter though because I'm not going to start and exit (I actually had to remove my Rift S and do it via the computer because Oculus' menu button wasn't responding at all both times) until I get the right placement.

2022-05-28 16:12:48.864047,Zoobley,Great experience with a few minor flaws,"4.5 stars out of 5  (bought this onsale)

At the beginning of the game it took a little bit to figure out what was going on, the controls were a tad bit clunky, and the main character that you play was a bit over the top in being a jerk (obviously the writers wrote it this way but still). It's not a game you can really rush through as each scene you're locked in place more or less as the dialogue plays out. 

However, once I played for an hour or so (about a full day or two in the game) all the mechanics started making sense and I really started to enjoy it. The first thing to realize is that this isn't really a puzzle game. There's maybe 2-5 puzzles at most . That's where you need to realize this is more of an experince game, and once I understood it I really enjoyed the heck out of this game. I took my time and explored and tried the different avenues of dialogue (the writing was very adult oriented and it made me laugh). Cool artwork, good use of twitter/instagram to help tell the story. 

To boil it down it made me feel what it would be like to live groundhog's day. This includes the good (getting more information to connect with people) and the bad ( having to relive the same boring introductions again and again, haha.) 
The voice acting was very good and the overall story carried some emotion weight which surprised me.  Do yourself a favor and give this game a shot if you have some freetime and can get it on sale. 

Some cons: As others mentioned you can only use the trigger to grab things. Kindof annoying but after 5 min it became my new normal so not really an issue.
 -when you teleport to a new spot it sets your physical head height to 6 ft ingame head height. I was playing on a chair for most of it and this meant I would have to stand up before teleporting to a spot I know I'd have to interact with objects that are a bit lower. Not a game breaker but definitly breaks immersion.","Dec 7, 2019 at 6:34 AM",5, 25,
2022-05-28 16:12:48.879006,Falisio,It is like being in the movie,"This is a very well thought out experience. During my first run through of the story I was not sure I made a good purchase. By the 5th day or so I began to see new dialog and new locations opening up and realized this game is much bigger than it seemed. I am about 5 hours in now and am feeling like I am really learning the story of the town and it's people. I feel the pain from the original movie, having to restart a scene 10 times back to back to get to the right dialog. There is a real feeling of reward when you get it right an have a positive impact.

The controls work well. It takes a minute to realize all actions with the environment require the trigger button. The grip button does nothing. It works. Some mini games require real precision with the controls and they work very well. 

I say buy it now while it is on sale. And if you miss the sale... Go ahead and buy it. It has many hours of content and feels personally rewarding to complete.","Dec 17, 2019 at 12:20 AM",5, 3,

*Game key supplied by the Developers

My Initial Thoughts:
I have to admit I am a big fan of these developers, they made 'Invisible Hours' one of my favourite and most unique VR games still to this day.
The concept of Groundhog day in VR makes for another unique experience and I love all the attention to detail that VR can bring to these type of experiences.
I think I saw the whole story in my initial playthrough (Around 20-30 mins) prior to starting again and trying to prevent things from happening, and this is the meat of the game, where you as the player have to figure out what and how to do things to change the timeline and events.
Solving the puzzles can be fun and challenging and the artstyle, animations and characters are all very well done and the game has a lot of polish.
My only concern is the length of the game for people who are good at puzzle solving hence why only 4 stars, and not 5.
Also there is no smooth locomotion in this game, it's all teleport based, and I can see why the developers did this for continuity reasons.  
All in all if you like the concept of re-acting scenes, enjoy a mild story and altering time-lines, then you'll probably really enjoy this.

Oh, and do yourself a favour and give 'Invisible Hours' a try. It's like VR's first interactive movie in VR.","Sep 18, 2019 at 2:01 AM",4, 21,
2022-05-28 16:12:48.908927,Plurr,,"I've got to say I expected more from Tequilaworks. There are a few issues that make me apply for a refund for this one. First off, the way you interact with objects is  clumsy and frustrating. Things fly out of your hand, you have to try to do the same simple actions several times... You use the triggers like digital buttons to clasp.  Secondly, I don't find the characters all that likeable, or the story very appealing. It's mostly fine, I suppose... Some characters have an unprovked aggressive style, but not in the meaningful way we saw in the film. There is a lot of puzzle emphasis here, so it's not like its all about the narrative... All in all, the production quality is too low for me to recommend this.","Sep 30, 2019 at 1:49 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 16:12:52.021601,RonnyBullet,Great Story but input lacks,"the Story and artstyle are great but small things like using the trigger instead of the grip button to grab something really take you out of the experience (every other game for oculus uses the grip button, this way it feels more like a vive port where someone didn´t want to change the inputs), free locomotion would be great, but i can understand that this was maybe an artistic choise, but the trigger thing is just sad because they could have at least give the player the option to change it :( regarding locomotion: maybe a mode like in westworld awakening could be added where the player is free to roam around and if conversations are triggert this ability is frozen (to keep the storytelling intact)","Sep 21, 2019 at 3:48 AM",3, 5,
