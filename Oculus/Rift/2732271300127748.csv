2022-05-28 20:41:41.397865,DelapierceD,Engaged VR Time Travel,"Artful and fast-paced, very worth trying out if you are into history. While the verbal message is very cautious about the horrors of war, Dan Carlin's voice seems to have a ""War is cool"" tone to it, in a ""This is so intense it will blow your mind"" way. But it works for VR

Would love more analysis of the war itself, rather than just the personal experience of its brutality, though still valuable","Mar 14, 2021 at 4:03 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 20:41:41.426787,eternomatador,Offers a glimps into the horrors of WW1,"I enjoyed the experience. ""War Remains"" really manages to make you feel how terrible it must have been in the trenches and no man's land. Audio design and narration are great. But it ended after only 14 minutes and you spend the intro and outro in the dark. That was rather disappointing. I thought it would at least last for 30-45 minutes. The experience would be a great fit for museums and I hope they market it in that direction. For general VR users I recommend it only if you are highly interested in WW1.","May 22, 2020 at 3:21 AM",3, 39,
2022-05-28 20:41:41.440750,Gamertag_VR,Too short to give you immersion,"Video review available by searching ‘Gamertag VR’ 

I love VR, the magic and realism the technology can deliver to such a thing as a story set in World War 1 got me very excited to check this out. 

I was going to be transported back in time to see, to hear and experience history thanks to VR. 

War Remains: Dan Carlin Immersive Story unfortunately doesn’t deliver this time. I say this time as I don’t want experiences to stop coming to virtual reality because it’s such a powerful medium.  At one point your in complete darkness hearing a bombardment of shells and it’s then you realise the sound design is superb! but unfortunately War Remains is kind of over before you get to the point of being transported. 

There’s no interaction or movement which is fine, but the ride is mostly consumed by blackness and ok graphics and animations. I imagine 2 years ago this would of been more of an impressive but after experiencing something as powerful as Ann Franks house which delivers a truly moving story which makes your feel like your not only there, but leaves you with a memory of the house and the what happened, this is hard to recommend. 

Clocking in at 13 minutes from title screen to end credits I was left very disappointed. Before I go any further I believe in what was attempted here. I want this. It’s good to remember what the world was and how we got to where we are today, it’s important. 

The very foundations or our reality now have been shaped by the past and to remember them with virtual reality is a fantastic but this  is one experience I can’t recommend.","May 22, 2020 at 10:03 PM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 20:41:41.455710,spectrecp,Hardcore History comes to life,"Big fan of Dan's show, Hardcore History. The experience presented here is troubling and dark but eye opening as well. I couldn't bring myself to rate at 5 stars because it was much shorter than I had hoped (Maybe 15 to 30 minutes). I hope to see more experiences like this in the future!","May 22, 2020 at 2:34 AM",4, 17,
2022-05-28 20:41:44.599302,wastelandsoldier,Not worth paying for,"I love Dan Carlin's podcast, Hardcore History, so I was looking forward to this VR experience. I wanted to like it, but unfortunately it really under delivers. There are a couple brief battle scenes, and then a lot of fluff. Dan Carlin's narration is great as you'd expect, but the visuals are very underwhelming. I'd don a VR set in a museum to see this and be happy that I had, but as paid content this is more of the same shovelware that plagues VR. Save your money.","May 23, 2020 at 5:41 AM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 20:41:44.613265,RuneSR2,"Nice, but too little content","Looks nice using CV1, although the spud (oled mura) is extremely pronounced. Works well using ss 2.0, but some scenes don't feel sufficiently optimized. There are impressive scenes - not sure it's worth 5 bucks. This is more like a poem, it only lasts about 15 minutes - so basically it's like paying $40 for a movie lasting 2 hours...
I don't see why this has an 18+ rating, not much is going on. 13+ would be more than fine.","May 23, 2020 at 5:30 PM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 20:41:44.627227,DiscoTim,"High quality, but short","This is quite short, and is just scratching the surface of what VR can do to bring history to life. Is it worth the $4.99? It depends. If you're not a history buff or a fan of Hardcore History, probably not. But for me, it was. I hope this is an indication of greater, longer, even more interactive experiences to come.","May 25, 2020 at 1:04 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:41:44.642187,TwistedErotica,Visuals don't live up to Great Narration,"Dan Carlin knocks it out of the part with the narration, but the visuals simply do not deliver the intense experiences he describes. It's a letdown and I would refund it in an instant, but I want Dan Carlin to keep my money since everything else he does is so fantastic.","Jun 9, 2020 at 3:35 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:44.656150,Thursby,Very good but very short experience.,"I bought this sight unseen just because its Dan Carlin related. Its a great experience, but very short, really about ten minutes of content. You can't do anything except look around. If you like WWI or Dan Carlin its well worth the investment.","May 28, 2020 at 6:22 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:41:47.754862,Tidyscoop,A very cool experience!,"I thought this app did a great job of showing battlefield conditions in WWI. It was historically accurate (as far as I can tell), entertaining, and the graphics were done really well. A little on the short side, but it also didn't cost much either.","May 27, 2020 at 6:56 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:47.770819,sumotoy,Absurdly short! Poor 3d design.,"It should be an immersive experience but graphics is really poor but it's too short as well! I don't raccomand this, it's not an experience, it should cost nothing, sorry...","May 30, 2020 at 3:13 AM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 20:41:47.799742,Dgres3,I want more,"I love Dan Carlin,  I have purchased all of his hard core history podcast.  He has had a huge inpact on me starting to learn again after school.  While this might be short and slightly underwhelming.  I want more of this in the future.  but if people do not buy it, and this is not supported.  We might not see more of this.  $5 to support this is a very small price to pay.  Dan, thank you for everything you do.  I think what you are doing is so important, specially because of the days we are living in now.  Buy the game, support this.","Jul 25, 2020 at 12:15 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:47.814702,Nittis,,"This was definetly an amazingly well crafted WW1 experience. The way it's designed, and the dark nightmarish atmosphere really makes it feel like you were  in a clear nightmare.

Unfortunately,
Its REALLY short. Like way too short for how much it costs, and for the amount of assets and animations that could've been reused. Kinda disappointed but i'll be sure to play this over and over anyway.

Ps,
The video preview is not compeltely accurate to what happens in the app. Same scenes, but it's made to look more than it is. Just be advised.","Jul 9, 2020 at 9:29 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:50.903441,Metalsech,Nicely Done,"A well crafted if pretty short series of scenes. No interaction you just watch and listen as stuff happens around you (though I kind of like that). Felt it could have done with some nice Private Ryan-esque music to give it an emotional kick, and I found the narration to be a little overblown, but maybe that's just me. An on-rails moving sequence or two wouldn't have gone amiss either. If you're interested in the world wars then it's definately worth checking out.","May 22, 2020 at 8:15 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 20:41:50.918401,NoMAD41,Amazing glimpse of modern storytelling,"Wow! What an amazing glimpse into the power of VR when used to tell a story. I hope that this title is successful in shaping the way we tell them going forward. Despite being fairly brief and not the most technically elaborate,  War Remains  manages to show how powerful and immersive VR can be. It gives you a small sense of the terrible fear men must have felt as they thrust so much horror upon each other. Well done!","May 27, 2020 at 2:34 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:50.932363,lonewolf537,Great Potential,"I'm a fan of Dan and his show, and I really enjoyed this experince.  If you are a big history fan, especially of the first world war, this is worth while experince.  I will say, I was sad to find out how short it was (about 15 min).  But those 15 minutes are incredible.  I think this shows massive potential of making more immersive memories.  If you want to get a glimps at the Trenches of World War One, this is a great way to do it.","May 25, 2020 at 3:23 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:50.947323,Snappytheclown,,"Could have been so much more.  Maybe experiences of more individuals.
All war is ugly .  This didn't show that to me.  Maybe that's because i lived it.  It's very diffucilt to express tn 15 minutes what is sacrificed by so many.  And for what?

Thanks for trying.","May 26, 2020 at 5:34 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:50.962283,tortieMVH,Short but sweet.,"I am a big Dan Carlin fan, so liked it a lot.  The experience was super short but great at the same time.  I hope there are more VR titles like this, but cheaper and a lot longer!  Is it worth it?  Maybe not, but I would still recommend it.","May 27, 2020 at 1:52 AM",5, 0,
