2022-05-28 17:10:31.898704,IntimateZombie,Short & Sweet,"A graphically amazing short film. Reminded me of characters from rayman. Lasted about 4 minutes or so.

2022-05-28 17:10:35.076206,Poogobbler,Dont get me wrong...,This level of quality animation is what I expect to see coming in 2018 across both Oculus and Vive.. hopefully. This is just a 5 minute short video basically but it looks great! If VR game developers would put this type of effort into full length games we'd really have something special to play.,"Jan 10, 2018 at 1:09 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:10:35.105128,onceinAwhile,Fun but it is just not working for VR,"To start with, graphics and animations are just fine; the issue is purely because story telling in VR is hard, and that is the reason why you don't see movies made in first person that much at the theater, and even less in VR.
Coco did great because it is interactive, so you can decide where to be and watch what is going on, but if you keep viewers stuck in a place in the scene, and just watch what is going on, that get boring after a while. Not even kids did hold enough attention to follow the whole thing, and were more interested in looking around instead than looking at the story.

Good start, well done on the technical side, but as experience; it is not involving enough and the VR is mostly a gimmik add for fun, more than for a useful purpose.","Jan 21, 2018 at 3:59 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 17:10:35.119090,CharveL68,A look ahead,"Excellent pro CGI animated film in VR.  This is a look into what we can expect from likely all animated trailers, and soon full features themselves, going forward.

Personally, I can't wait to watch a 5-star full animated movie through VR, and the shorts that I have watched (like ""Henry"") have been great examples of what to expect in the near future for movies.

Great job guys and thank you for this FREE experience!","Dec 28, 2017 at 8:58 AM",5, 5,

The only downside for me was that i spent a bit of time looking in the wrong direction at the other bunny and missed some of the action i should have been looking at, but it was still enjoyable.

2022-05-28 17:10:44.560837,Isterio Larmakosa,"Funny, cute, nice intro to VR","It's a great short VR animation film. It's so short they decided to ruin it a little by adding a somewhat expensive introduction and conclusion (when I say expensive, I am referring to the hiring of Ethan Hawke for the narrator's voice) to make it feel ""fuller""... But I actually think it kills half of the fun. The first time I had tried this short movie, I started directly on the frozen lake, and was slowly introduced to the other characters. It made everything works way better. The intro kinda ruins one of the scene afterwards. 1st time I ""played"" it, I wasn't quite sure what was happening, and the way you find out with the eagle coming back was hilarious. Nice emotion then. Now it doesn't work as much, since you're warned from the start about the evilness of some characters. Nitpicking I guess, but to me it feels like a big mistake! Anyway, it's still enjoyable and very nice introduction to anyone new to VR.","Sep 21, 2017 at 11:01 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:10:44.575799,Eulenauge66,I love bunnies,...and VR movies. I just wish the viewers` position wouldn´t be fixed but moved around.

2022-05-28 17:10:47.749309,neuro27,Expertly Executed Short Film,"The ""Invasion!"" experience is both family-dinner inviting and mob scene invigorating. It’s highly engaging by building dynamic characters and beautiful imagery that's easy to navigate.  The sound effects, music and visual flashes guide the viewer's attention in a smooth and comfortable manner. There’s so much to see that you become immersed and want to look everywhere.

Whenever I felt my attention had drifted from the action, their techniques brought me right back to where the main story was happening.  I felt both safe and wonderfully overwhelmed all at the same time.","May 20, 2017 at 11:17 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 17:10:57.216986,jmalmsten,Very limiting viewpoint,"Like most 360-videos. This video also makes me wish I was anywhere other than the chosen viewport. After the initial interaction between me as a viewer and the bunny all of the action is moved a long way away. And the experience continues ""over there"". Why is it that whenever new storytelling tools come along (sound, color, scope, 3D, etc) the first thing that happens is that the camera gets locked down and the narrative transformes into a stageplay? Just get the evolution over with. Move the camera. Or at least pick viewports that are interesting... And don't be afraid to cut. For me cuts don't break immersion. Dead-time is the great immersion breaker.","Dec 2, 2016 at 6:33 AM",2, 2,
