2022-05-28 15:19:19.342325,UndeadEdd,awesome cyberpunk experience,"it's an awesome cyberpunk game, really shows a nicely crafted world, though small it may be. some puzzle solving. a bit of action. a few cool real-world old videos you can watch as part of the in-game world. ending was a bit confusing... a few types of collectibles to find. overall was an awesome experience.",Apr 10 at 1:15 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:19:19.357285,CIC_Zork,Beautiful,"This is an exemplary appetizer into the cyberpunk world quality available from this developer. It tastes of electricity, dystopia and worn android dreams. 
If this speculative fiction attracts you, bone up, drop out and jack in. This is only a taste and it will keep your processor jonesing for another fix. Taste your tears, lost in rain, understand the breadcrumbs and Easter eggs paying homage to a televised revolution and let your consciousness be digitized. 
Oh, and by the way, did I mention it’s a delicious game?","Sep 30, 2020 at 10:37 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:19:19.371247,josh.mullis,A good addition to the cyberpunk world,"If you are a cyberpunk fan, this is an absolute must have.  DO NOT give up on this due to the opening scene.  While at first you may be disappointed by the graphics and scale of items in the environment, you quickly are immersed into the developer's intent with the atmosphere and story line.  This is a small team and they did an amazing job with very little.

If anything, buy this to support them growing their cyberpunk vr army and giving us more content in the future... like LOW-FI. 🙂","Jun 10, 2020 at 2:27 AM",4, 21,
2022-05-28 15:19:19.386208,Garden711,Loved it,"I put rift on and was blown away. Yes, it is kind of cryptic in places, but that really pushes you to explore. I have gone back through and played many times and realized there were still things I hadnt seen. Its not extremely intense, but at the same time its very enveloping to the user. 

I loved the track called M.U.R.C. Run. I want to do the score for your next cyberpunk adventure.","Dec 15, 2019 at 6:10 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:19:19.401167,autoexec.bat,Bad.,"Love the theme, big cyberpunk, Neuromancer and Blade Runner fan. The tone, aesthetic and feel of this game is fantastic! But. I have played games since 1992, and I am quite fine with games not holding players hand with extensive tutorials, but here I am stuck in this depressing little room in the beginning of the game for jack knows for how long, and have tried almost everything but still can't progress.  I refuse to google what else I must do. Dont't fall for the nice trailer and save your money. Devs obviously give 0 F's about user expierence. Just read their replies to critical reviews. Sheesh.
Update: Thank you for your replay! Admitting mistakes is very admirable thing in my opinion. Wish you success in future!","Sep 30, 2019 at 4:43 PM",3, 5,"Hey. Just want to say that I completely agree with you that the puzzle in the first room is dumb. This is the one of the best lessons that I've learned about VR design. Under no circumstances should the user take off the headset frustrated. That original room was made back in 2014. 

Anyway. Not trying to make excuses. Rest assured that you're right, and moving forward, the mistake wont be made again. If you want to get passed that room, Im pretty easy to get a hold of. I'll walk you through it. There arent any more dumb puzzles in the game passed it.

And I just read the last line of your review. lol. People change I guess?"
2022-05-28 15:19:22.519826,Anton_bcn,Very nice!,"Great atmosphere! The scale is to big... but its ok... The mini games to hard but thanks for tetris i can beat one record to progress ) like it so far...

2022-05-28 15:19:22.534786,JOakes,One of the first great VR games,"Listen kids, before you all had gigabit bandwidth pumping youtube videos into your eyeballs 24/7 all we had was movies and dial-up modems.  We had to imagine our virtual worlds and what would happen if the corps and big govt took over every aspect of our lives with ubiquitous computing and cameras.  GOOD THING THAT NEVER HAPPENED! (hah!)  Technolust is a love letter to the dreams of that future that may (or may not) ever happen.  This game is EARLY in the VR scene.  It's not perfect, but, take your time and do not rush through it.  Realize that every scene has it's own audio, lighting, texture and style and that is where the world 'lives' in the game.  The Story is almost secondary to the world it exists in and it's a really fun ride.

Explore and hang out in the scenes when you can.  Think about the story that the scenery tells, there's a TON of details and nothing is mere 'background noise'.  This is video game as art in the form of a pulp cyberpunk graphic novel.  If you don't play it through at least once, you're missing out on a great experience.","Jul 3, 2019 at 9:57 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:19:22.549746,ShawnyBee,Cool experience,"Great realised Cyberpunk VR experience. For the most part it's a point n click game,with a handful of rooms/small areas to explore, with little gameplay outside of the arcade games (Kerser being the highlight) All up it feels like it could have used a bit of extra polish on the little things. Sometimes teleporting around would then have me redo things I had already had to do, ""to-do list"" got stuck telling me things I had already done, achievements didn't unlock, during last part certain areas became very choppy (running a 2070) and to be honest I am not sure if I even finished it.

However on sale it was good and worth my time. Hope to see more like this. A definite VR must just for the gritty cyberpunk visuals, music an atmosphere. Such a Johnny Mnemonic vibe, hope next game has a dolphin in it.","Jul 14, 2019 at 9:53 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:19:22.565703,keebz,A really enjoyable cyberpunk story,"Yeah it's pretty much every cyberpunk cliche rolled into a two hour game... But ITS EVERY CYBERPUNK CLICHE ROLLED INTO A 2 HOUR GAME!

2022-05-28 15:19:22.579667,Deemo101,Great Amtosphere!,"It's like a mash up of Bladerunner, The Matrix and Johnny Mnemonic among others. I can't fathom out the motorcycle bit though. No controls work for me and I have to close the game and restart.","Jul 5, 2019 at 10:43 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:19:25.689349,NotTheLips,Saved by moments of brilliance.,"This is is a game which is, in turns, fantastic and awful; two extremes, and seldom anything in between.  It is not reviewed easily.

The concepts and inspirations it draws from align with beloved things.  Blade Runner.  Neuromancer.  TRON.  Max Headroom! (The Matrix - yuck).  The telling of the future from the perspective of the eighties.  The fact we can experience this using a VR headset today - post Space 1999 / 2001 A Space Odyssey visions.   

This game, played by us in the present, sets us back in the ideas of the eighties about today.  Wild!  This is where the game absolutely excels.  One of the best moments is the ""Bits and Bytes segment"" (Luba Goy, Billy Van!  Wow).  Maybe more than anything, this is the soul of the game.  If you haven't sat (or stood) through that clip in the subway, you need to.  It's the essence of this game (I hope the author forgives me for making this assumption, I would guess the clip was chosen with very specific intention, and what a brilliant choice!).

The day-to-day of the game though, sorry to say, is clunky.  Some objects we can interact with.  We can pick them up, examine them, and put them back down.  Others not.  Sometimes objects obey natural physics.  Other times, they vanish;  did they go into our inventory (which we can never examine), or teleport back to where they were picked up?

Hand controls are not intuitive either.  I will attribute this to, maybe, the author working on it before touch controllers were finalised.  Still, some objects can be added to (the) inventory (which you can never peruse) by an index finger press.  It's inconsistent and confusing.

Interface problems aside, the world that's created here with its lush audio and well chosen music, visual style, and the deliberate way in which the premise reveals itself as one explores, is perfect.

It's so difficult to assign an ""out of 5"" stars rating to this game, because it deserves more than just an overall. 

Verdict:  recommended!","Mar 4, 2019 at 11:04 AM",3, 8,"Thanks for this very thoughtful and (I think) fair review.
You can find a VHS copy of the Bit's and Bytes episode inside the subway booth to watch more comfortably in your apartment btw ;)
You're 100% right the most of the clunkyness comes from Touch support being added later. Glad you got past it and appreciated my vision regardless."
2022-05-28 15:19:25.705306,DButcha,Visual Novel- PS: What song is this?????,"This is not a game, it's really like a representation of a virtual world. If you took themes from the matrix, added a retro vr vibe, and some philosophic elements this is what you get. It's truly unique and as a late oculus owner who started with touch, this is regarded as a classic for me. The artwork, story, and music is TOP quality.

PS: Devs, I know you've released a ""Complete soundtrack"" on bandcamp.com. Yet the song from the HOLODEXX bar is not included!! I've google music searched the song and there is no match, this is the first time i've ever heard a song this good to not be online ANYWHERE! I've made a recording of my gameplay and confirmed that shazam does not know the song, ie it ""doesn't exist"". I've emailed you through bandcamp about this song but no reply. Who put this track together? Where can we hear more of their fantastic work?? I'll continue to try and figure out who is on this song as it is that good, for lack of better words its a BANGER!!

PSS: For those who haven't heard this song, its like Phantogram had an lsd trip with Daft Punk","Nov 16, 2018 at 5:12 PM",5, 13,"Thanks for the great review :) The track from HOLODEXXX is a late addition from the expansion. It's by a band called Secret Sign, they're on bandcamp also. It's off their recent album called Night Rituals. Glad you like them, they're going to be a big part of the next game's sound track.
If you contact me directly view twitter @anticleric or the same at gmail I can send you the other missing tracks from the expansion as well."
2022-05-28 15:19:25.720266,ScrapMechanic,An Exercise in Frustration,"First, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of all things Cyberpunk.  This game is the worst thing I've ever spent money on.  It's unimaginitive and NOT fun!  It just irritated me.  They think making stupid little things difficult is the same as making things challenging.  Boring!!!  Go back to bussing tables, you hacks.","Dec 11, 2018 at 4:28 AM",1, 3,"Just a reminder that you can refund titles on the Oculus store.
Sorry you didn't enjoy it, but there's no need to be insulting to the developer (me)."
2022-05-28 15:19:25.736223,Alicia_Wonderland,Just wow!,"I just spent three hours in this game and I think (hope!) I’m still towards the begining! This is an interactive movie-like adventure game that mixes aspects of the TV show “Mr. Robot” with a hardcore cyberpunk feel.  I love that you have time to explore in detail the amazing creativity of the developers, writers and artists. There is no one chasing you, no one to kill (so far) but you are completely immersed in the world and can relax and check it all out. There are games within games, an arcade to jump into several completely different games. There are entire retro TV shows to watch on in-game TV screens if you want to take the time. I actually sat through an entire Canadian TV show that looked like it was from the early 80’s that gave a good education on the history and educational value of computer games, making the game itself educational. The newscasts (which appear Canadian too, based on the slight accent) are brilliant and worth listening to twice as are the ads and billboards. I have to check if the developpers are Canadian, most of my favorite sci-fi TV shows are Canadian and this feels like it may be too. If you like speeding through games to get points and accomplishments, I would suggest just stop, and really explore all the nooks and crannies and creativity that went into this without the fear of being killed (except in the mini arcade games.) Click on each character you meet several times for interesting dialogue and check out all the AI’s memories for even more content. I would have spent even more time in the game but as wonderfully immersive as it is, it can get a little dark and depressing. I hope there are some daylight scenes coming up. My only complaint is that all the scenery is really so dark. I guess electricity in this world is only used for computers and billboards, not for general lighting! I’m enjoying taking a very slow time exploring all the details and look forward to continuing and can’t wait to see what the developers do next!","Nov 20, 2018 at 12:14 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:19:25.751183,In5an1ty,Stellar,"An amazing experience.
There are no real ""riddles"", so it's more of a walking sim.
But an amazing one.
Could be longer, it took me about 3h to finish, but for me the story and atmosphere definitely make up for it, ymmv.","Dec 10, 2018 at 7:32 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:19:28.847901,Lifson,Genuinely loved it,"I'm a big fan of Cyberpunk and, from the very beginning, it felt like this game was made for me.  The atmosphere is great, the storyline is interesting, the minigames diverted me for quite a while, and I still go back from time to time despite having completed it.  It's a bargain.","Oct 19, 2018 at 7:01 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:19:28.863858,Massive_Banana,Unfocused gameplay but definitely cool.,"There's more gameplay in the various minigames than the actual core game, which is mechanically less complex than one of those 90's point and click adventure games. There is next to no requirement for gaming skill of any kind. I think the developers would have been better off not bothering with all the arcade games and ""hacking"", and just focused on more meaningful core gameplay. As it is, the game seems to confuse player ignorance with a sense of mystery and ""puzzle solving"".

Another sore point: for an experience which heavily relies on dialogue, it's often times impossible to understand what anyone is trying to say.

This would be a one star review, except for the fact that I love cyberpunk and the atmosphere of this game is spot on. If you're a diehard cyberpunk fan like me, you'll probably still get enjoyment out of this, albeit a shallow experience. I'd love to see more work from this developer.","Aug 31, 2018 at 5:07 AM",3, 11,
2022-05-28 15:19:28.877821,Fraggit,So good...,Just being submerged in and exploring the amazingly detailed environment was enough to keep me happy for hours.

2022-05-28 15:19:28.893778,JDakotaPowell,Hats off for a new form of entertainment,"Spent many hours probing the dystopic cyberpunk world of Technolust only to realize that one needs to take the developer at his word – this is an interactive *novel*. It’s not a short linear experience – eg, a film that you can watch once and then walk away. It’s not a quick shooting game – eg shoot all enemies and you win. Technolust is layered and complex. You may need to visit the same scene a few times because every time you revisit a scene in this novel, you discover something new. In sum, the world reveals itself in layers – it’s akin to piecing together a giant jigsaw puzzle. I would argue that this developer is presenting a new form of entertainment – be aware that it’s not something you may have experienced before, so prepare to be a little confused in the beginning. My answer: go with it, swim with the Technolust tide. You are entering a new frontier that offers quite the journey. The scenes are visually stunning. They fulfill the VR promise of complete immersion. Throughout Technolust, I found that the embedded videos and robots boost immersion. Plugging into a robot’s memory was wild – surprising – and suddenly shifts your point of view. You will slowly learn what you need to do re gameplay – the instructions are not always in-your-face. Some may view this aspect as a negative. I see it as a positive. You are dropped into this bizarre world and need to figure it out. The clues are there. Technolust is a rare and beautiful piece. Most importantly, it advances this new medium to a new level.","Jul 16, 2018 at 4:14 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:19:32.000469,JackDiddley,Love The Setting But Gameplay Is Flat,"I am a huge fan of the Gibson Cyberpunk setting and this game absolutely nailed it.  The settings in the game are excellent, very dark future from a 1980s perspective.  The environments are not very large and I found myself wanting to interact with more of it.  There are robots and people around, they basically say one liners and that's about it.  
I found myself walking around wondering what I am supposed to do next.  I checked my watch several times which can tell you what your next mission is, but it is kind of vague.  It feels unfinished, like they created an environment but nothing to do in it.  At first it felt like ther was danger and urgency but really there isn't.  Nobody is coming for you, there is no action, and you're just walking around in a Cyberpunk world trying to figure out what the next thing is.  That thing is exact by design, very linear, and sometimes very difficult to find.  I'm not even really clear on what it is I am trying to accomplish in the game, just that I don't want to get caught... not that there is anyone actually looking for me.
In short what I would have liked with this game is MORE.   A clear story, some action, maybe a little gunplay... I mean it is Cyberpunk after all.
A couple of the games in the arcade were cool, and a couple of them were kind of silly.  The environments are well done, but does the dark future have to be so... well DARK?
I don't remember what I paid for this game but I wouldn't recommend paying more than a few bucks for it.  If there were more space to walk around in I'd consider it a viable ""experience"" but overall the game part of it is not very interesting.
A disappointment as I really wanted to like this one.","Jul 4, 2018 at 2:06 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 15:19:32.016426,ccdeltabeta,My First Nominee for 'Requested ReMaster,"Kudos to the developers for creating a cyberpunk-type world I would desperately like to play more around in.  Less kudos to the developers for gameplay that falls short of the lavish world created.  This game feels like the first draft of a screenplay that you would like to see developed into a full-scale movie.
What a strange, yet interesting world that was created here.  A mixture of Blade Runner, Fallout (the Wastelands), Total Recall, and probably other references I was too slow to pick up on.  If you take the time to look around, you might find some intersting pop-culture references.  In one building in DownTown, there were cannisters in one of the shops; if you look at the top top of ther cannisters, you will see Zombies in hibernation (Return of the Living Dead, anyone).  Neat marvelous visual touches.
As for the gameplay, it's not so good.  In a number of areas, the scale feels off, like all of a sudden I was smaller compared to everything else around me.  Also, the tasks that can be accomplished by using the grip and trigger buttons need tobe better explained (trying to grab the carbon and aluminum to get out of the apartment was frustrating, but once I realized which control to use, it got easier).
The story was more often confusing than clear (not that I don't enjoy trying to figure some stuff out), like when I apply the 'cure' to the first group of people/droids in the Dance Club, and then the credits started playing on an in-game TV screen.  I thought the game was gone, but after checking some walk-throughs on-line, I discovered there was more to do.
Bottom Line: This game comes across as a rough draft of an awesome screenplay; there is some neat concepts and visuals here, but the gameplay does not match the scope of the screenplay.
I'll probably play through the game again to see what I missed.","Jul 11, 2018 at 2:04 PM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 15:19:32.048341,Drewskii88,too much film grain!--story?-action?,"Firstoff I'll state im a huge blade runner fan,total recall, aliens(funny Bishop ref) and other sci-fi genres and love what the devs have ref here in the game. However there are way too many bugs,graphical glitches, objects not having clipping or collision detection along with terrible scaling issues that drive me crazy. The in game VR mini games(hacker mode) were the only enjoyable experiences as the controls worked like a dream! The blurry film grain look is well over done and needs to be cleaned up by giving users the option as most games do that use any amount of excessive grain (usually done to hide AA and poor textures). I got this on sale and will be requesting a refund as the game crashes due to spatial audio (per crash report) and TBH the music is not good at all. I found myself trying to turn off and throw the annoying boomboxes that blare music above main soundtrack. 3 stars as the classic ref are there and mini games are quite good but the overall story and Main gameplay is lackluster for sure--Basically a walking sim dressed in sci-fi clothes that relies heavily on said classic references, if not for the mini games this ""game"" would have zero action or puzzle work etc.","Jun 20, 2018 at 10:15 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:19:32.063301,vrgamerdude,Still one of my all time favorites!,Technolust has always been one of my absolute favorite VR experiences. I remember seeing the original demo back in the day and just sitting in the apartment window staring out at the animated billboards and watching the flying cars go by as I thought that this was it! This was what I had dreamed that VR would be like and that was on an early version played with a DK2. The original demo was one of the things I would use for demoing to newcomers of VR and sometimes still use this game for that purpose! If you still have yet to experience the dark and gritty Dystopian Cyber Punk future that Technolust portrays then you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this game!,"May 12, 2018 at 3:11 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:19:35.164007,OlivierJT,Made in 2016 but still very worth it.,"Technolust is on some aspect a little dated, but if you are looking for a strong dive into a blade runner like universe, it's a must have.

The mood, the music and general ambience are very solid, they will drive you to do the whole game in one very long sitting and ask for more a sign of great engaging content!

It runs great on my outaded pc, so that's a big plus.

I bought it nearly 2 years ago and now that I heard about Technolust 2 in developement, if I could buy it twice or more to support the dev, I would.
It was that good.","May 6, 2018 at 9:19 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:19:35.179965,Wade_Watts,Very immersive,"Dunno how people can even think about giving this game a rating below 3 stars. 
The first time I played technolust has been before it even was in the oculus store and I hadn´t have touch controllers. I remember the first time when I sat at the desk and I saw the city outside the window, I instantly stood up and wanted to walk up to the window..unfortunately I forgot that something was next to me and I almost stumbled over the floor. The game itself has a huge immersion and I had nostalgic feelings when encountering all the arcade stations and of course it felt kind a like blade runner´ish. If this guy would have more financial ressources unimaginable what he could accomplish in the vr genre. Just buy it.","May 7, 2018 at 1:23 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 15:19:38.367439,Hanover,Classic Rift Experience - Except for Bug,"This is one of the early ""experiences"" on the Rift and still impresses to this day.  You're dropped into a cyberpunk world that's Neuromancer with a little bit of Max Headroom the TV series.

The author added a lot more content since it's first release which added much needed story content.

The character models are a wee bit too ""Disney Animatronic-y"" but the environments are incredible.  I like to walk through it once a year or so.

Unfortunately I've never gotten to see the ""Alternative Ending"" due to a bug where going into the wreckshop after going up to the tower in Mars always crashes the game.  I've tried this on three different computers with the same result.  So I can never return after killing the AI...very disappointing.

Also, be aware that if you're reinstalling this after already have installed it, and you get a little pop-up saying that you need to install Direct X 9c, try rebooting.  Thats what fixed it for me.","May 11, 2019 at 3:34 AM",3, 3,Glad you figured out the Dx9 issue. Thanks for the review :)

Graphics:  Graphically the game does a great job of putting you there.  I think it was origially a seated experience so the scale may appear a tad off but  not so much that it ruins the game.  I just love the lighting and grunginess of the city and other areas you explore.  The story is driven along in some points with live action actors which actually works really well with immersing you into this world.  The character models look good but there are no facial animations so they seem a bit odd.  many of them have masks or are robots so it works.  
Sound: I love it!  pounding driving techno music, spacial audio, just over all the sound is great.  I particually love the get your a$$ to mars tune.  
Game Play/story:  This is an adventure game at heart.  It does a really great job of letting you pretend and be someone else for a while in a really well crafted world.  It's not huge,. I think it took me maybe 4 hours to complete, and I was sad when it was over.  The controls worked great,. except for some of the mini games in the arcade but I was playing with Vive wands so that may have been my issue.  
Final Verdict:  This may be an older game, but it is a VR classic!  If you don't have it, you should!  Blade Runner in VR.  What's not to like?","May 6, 2018 at 10:22 PM",4, 3,

See dev's predictable response below that should read as ""I simply can't be arsed"".

I did get stuck a couple times but eventually figured it out.  It would be cool if all the games in the arcade could be playable.","Feb 28, 2017 at 7:29 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:20:10.042719,Cheesemaster1,"Loved this game , cant wait to replay","Can not wait to replay this game with touch, even with a controller it was my first real sense of presence. Between charcters eyes following you and also I didnt realize i was walking into a garbage can in the game while i was kneeling down and I fell over as I bumped into it which was pretty incredible. Great story, FULL GAME","Feb 9, 2017 at 4:06 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:20:13.125474,RazedPlays,Unpolished,"Very buggy and difficult to understand. I loved the cyberpunk atmosphere and hope to see another game aim for a similar theme, but with better execution.","Mar 15, 2017 at 12:33 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 15:20:13.142429,rabbitovsky,Incredible detail.  BUT!,"I decided to put this game down about an hour in upon hearing that it was going to obtain motion control support once Oculus Touch came out.

As it stands, it is a nice typical 'point-and-click' style adventure game with incredible visuals that screams for room-scale/motion controllers for interaction.  Fascinating arcade games are a fun distraction and add to the value of this ""less gamey"" game as a whole.  Got nauseous with the gamepad controls, hoping the patches and updates will cause this to be a non-issue and my 4-Star rating reflects that.","Dec 16, 2016 at 7:32 AM",4, 14,

2022-05-28 15:20:13.174343,Negchampa,Pretty good,Not a bad game. Great one the first play through although after playing through once not much reason to go back. Worth the price IMO.,"Feb 16, 2017 at 10:23 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:20:13.190301,Tirian_the_Blue,Best VR game so far,"I really liked this game, it has the best story and the games lasts for a long time","Feb 11, 2017 at 2:43 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:20:16.293999,buzzert,Incredible,Absolutely incredible game. The attention to detail in every corner of this title is astounding. The soundtrack is also fantastic and goes really well with the theme of the game. I could spend hours in the arcade alone (contains a bunch of mini games),"Jan 16, 2017 at 4:31 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:20:16.309957,Huxley133,"One of the first ""real"" games I played!","I highly recommend this game. The world is just stunning and it features normal locomotion so you can freely explore it! 

It feels a little bit like a small Fallout game in VR but with it's own charm!","Nov 12, 2016 at 11:26 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:20:16.325914,L3xan,Starts Real Strong,"The first couple areas are exactly what you want, but there just isn't much to the last half (or more) of the game.  The plot never really takes off and ends abruptly.  It seems like the developer ran out of steam early in the project.  It's all the more disappointing for the promise the first areas show.","Oct 11, 2016 at 5:18 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:20:16.342869,GtAwyFrmMyRamen,"Cool Initial atmosphere, terrible ending","You know those stories you used to have to write in school that initially were really exciting, and you had this awesome plot and fleshed out characters and all these cool ideas, but as the deadline drew near you began to lose interest/time and cut everything down and ended it with some half-as*ed ending? That's what this feels like.
It's pretty cool at first, has a good feeling, sets a great mood. But halfway through everything just goes downhill. The story, environments, interactions. By the end the only reason I was still playing was because I said to myself, ""Welp.. I've come this far.""
The ending is terrible.","Jul 25, 2016 at 3:24 PM",2, 14,
