2022-05-28 20:39:59.368756,DerKleineLeo,Fun But Short Wave Shooter,"Disclaimer: I was given a free key by the developers to review the game. I will still try to be as unbiased as possible and give a fair review.

Arrows is a fun experience, the graphics are fine and the game ran extremely well on my GTX 1070. I experienced no hiccups, stutters or crashes.

It plays very much like the bow shooting game from the Lab, you defend a village from incoming waves of enemies.
There are three different types of enemies:
Unarmored but fast, armored slower and a giant Orc-like thing.
You can either shoot them with your bow or a cannon. There's also the option to light an arrow on fire for increased damage.
There are three kingdoms, each of which features different looks and skins for the attackers. There is a viking themed, a medieval themed and some sort of ice village. Each kingdom features three levels. You can play all levels at day (easy), dusk (medium) or night (hard). They are challenging, but not impossible to play through.
As stated in another review, the arrows sometimes just go through enemies, even though it looks like they were hit.

Overall, Arrows is a fun, but sometimes a little frustrating experience that is also suitable to demonstrate VR to newcomers. 
If you like repeating the same level over and over again, trying to improve with every run, Arrows will be a lot of fun. If you expect a long, story-driven game, you should look elsewhere.","Aug 31, 2020 at 6:21 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:39:59.383716,Blooddash,Fun Game w/ Minor Pain Points,"It's a fun wave shooter with a bow / sometimes cannons which I played on my Quest Link. I thought it was a lot of fun and the art style was cute and unique. There's teleport points to get different angles which were fun. It took me a little while to get a good enough aim with the bow but once you got it it feels much better. I got through the first 5 levels so far fairly well (day difficulty)

Only criticisms I have to give are I watched some shots go through the character models with no reaction at all which was a little upsetting (especially at the early stages before I got a good feel for the bow). The other was that it didn't feel good while sitting. In the main menu I would have to shoot another orb then back (teleport) every time so I was at table height. Not sure if gameplay was effected by the same issue but it didn't necessarily feel like it.

I'd love it if there were achievements so we could get some of the character models for the Oculus Home.","Jul 17, 2020 at 6:59 AM",4, 3,

Can you please fix the glitch where arrows go through the units? It is very annoying when playing. Otherwise the game is great.

Thanks,","Oct 24, 2020 at 7:17 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 20:39:59.412639,Blue_Jello,Fun Wave shooter,This is a great wave shooter. I shoot bows in real life so I really liked how this felt in VR. As long as you know what you are getting into you will have fun with this game.,"Jul 21, 2020 at 1:42 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:39:59.427599,OdinTheOdious,A fun VR archery Game,"I've played most of the PCVR archery games on the market and Arrows will definitely be one that I keep coming back to. The main things an archery based wave shooter like this needs to do is to challenge you but also feel fair. The knocking and loosing need to feel right, along with aiming and power. Arrows gets all of these spot on. It really is a joy to play.

The variation on map and enemy styles keep things interesting with the addition of faster/larger enemies so that you feel a sense of progression. There's also the opportunity to keep attempting a clean pass for each level and to improve your score so there's tons of replayability.

I've added the game to my daily VR Fit routine as it's perfect for a warm up as it'll really inspire me to put the headset on so as to try and beat my previous scores.

I played Arrows wires-free on an Oculus Quest via Virtual Desktop. It played perfectly under these conditions via a 5Ghz Wi-Fi network.","Jul 19, 2020 at 8:27 AM",5, 3,
