2022-05-28 18:40:20.086773,DelapierceD,Fun Beta Test!,"Really cool concept, very fun, love the Steam Punk., and excited for more. I knock a star for a story in which the British protagonist team uncritically steals artifacts from other countries. At least embed social commentary on the Colonialism. Ideally, just do not have Colonizers stealing from Colonized peoples","Jan 9, 2021 at 11:56 AM",4, 0,Thanks for the Review! Appreciate the comments.
2022-05-28 18:40:20.102731,RScullion,Understand that this is a 30min game,I knew this was a 30 minute experience going in and got it on sale so I don't mind too much. Bits are very polished and others less so (the cat should be removed until the animation is sorted). Feels like they started out with great ambition but couldn't finish it. I enjoyed what was there and would probably buy more chapters if offered at a sensible price.,"Mar 16, 2020 at 4:05 AM",4, 4,

Arabian Art Studios Graphic designers are extremly talented and I hope that they will have enough money one day to do a Great game, it will be huge for sure.","Mar 5, 2020 at 7:50 PM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:40:20.131654,mishka11,Fun while it lasted...,"Is this a prologue to a bigger game? The entire Himalaya level barely took 30mins to complete. The professor installs the artifact into the machine pedestals..there are another 6 or so additonal pedestals I assumed would be for the next artifact adventures. This game has so much potential!... good storyline, acting, scenery puzzle elements (although i abhor mirror reflection puzzles)..so I was looking forward to the next adventure level..
But then the credits rolled!
When the credits were done...you're back on the ship and told by the professor to ""feel free to explore the cutlass."" Game is apparentluy over. Very disappointed
If this was prologue to a larger game...then it should be explained as such and be free or only a couple bucks. Not sure i recommend this game if this is all there is","Dec 28, 2019 at 12:21 AM",2, 18,
2022-05-28 18:40:20.146613,ParadiseDecay,Looks great but feels unfinished!,"My Initial Thoughts:
Amazing graphics, art, atmosphere and storytelling, but this feels like a project that was cut down in its prime after just 1 major mission. As a result the game feels unfinished, which is a dam shame becuase I so wanted to play more missions and go off on more adventures.

2022-05-28 18:40:23.258291,shiwero,Where is the rest of it?,"This should have been marked as demo.
It has a very nice feel to it and all of the 5 puzzles need some work, but it has potential. To bad it's not finished.

This is an unfinished game.
The cat that's running around only has ""runing"" animation even when it's jumping/walking, just looks like the animator was lazy.
Minimum amount of interaction with surrounding objects.
Spinning the cylinder in the second puzzle caused it to rotate in the opposite direction.
And the fact that its short, shows that this is an unfinished game.","Dec 31, 2019 at 11:44 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 18:40:23.272253,Scoremonger,Nice ideas poisoned by rough execution,"I only played this for 30 minutes before requesting a refund, but here's what I observed.

Pros:
+ Good voice acting.
+ Nice character/creature designs.
+ Good environment artwork.
+ Use of the two basic tools you start with is pretty intuitive.
+ Cheap.

Cons:
- Some of the animations are very rough, especially on the airship.
- Puzzles are poorly designed - bad feedback in a couple cases, tedious in another. Sometimes you can't see the effects your actions are having without turning around, for example.
- After the first major puzzle, an annoying droning sound fills the air. It's awful.
- During the second major puzzle, you're bombarded by verbal hints, even though the solution is obvious. Between the nonstop droning noise from the first puzzle and the endless hints, I couldn't take it anymore and tapped finishing the second puzzle.

Overall, this just feels like an early access game. With some puzzle redesign and polish, it could be worth getting.","Dec 26, 2019 at 7:45 AM",2, 9,
