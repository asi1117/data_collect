2022-05-28 20:08:51.598352,death264,Great but one small issue.,"First of all I absolutly love the game, great concept, great mechanics, and amazing highlights from other games. However, the community takes advantage of backing up wayy to much. Normally I would be fine with it but it is so agrrovating when you try to hit someone and you cant because they backed away too much. Just please make the boundaries smaller or make the melee portion go further too them.",Oct 9 at 4:06 AM,4, 28,

2022-05-28 20:08:51.627780,azj911,AI has hacks,"during the fights whenever you go in for an attack time slows down and so you have to move at just the right speed to move as fast as possible however this doesn't apply to the ai and they just block at light speeds and attacks at impossible angle, they are allowed to move outside of their border aswell without taking any damage so the player is unable to hit them without takeing damage. And last thing is that the AI has the arms of slenderman and are able to have their arms right infront of you and block your attack before you even extend your arm however if you do make it past this defense they are also behind their border so you can't hit them regardless",Oct 6 at 9:50 AM,1, 5,
2022-05-28 20:08:51.642740,drayerdx,Well done.,"I seen this game and as a newcomer at the time, I passed it up thinking it was some low-end standing arena broken sword fighter. Welp after about 6 months of playing VR (Alyx,Pavlov,Pop One, Larcenauts, Blade and Sorcery..) I said whatever, let's check it out. I was dying for a competitive game that felt decent, challanging yet winnable. This was that game!

         I've gotten a decent sweat going, friendy people in-game, the population is a bit low, however match finding does not seem to be an issue. I won't get into gameplay much, as I would suggest you experience it yourself! Such a good buy for the price and what it offers!

       All in all this game achieves the goal so many VR titles with MP have failed at.

2022-05-28 20:08:51.657700,Deromitor,the players let the game down,"this game has real potential but the players of the game don't, seems like everyone but a very select few take things to advantage such as coming up really close  so you cant block attacks and just flailing the weapon around so you don't know were your meant to block also spamming is a big thing, bullets should take more energy than other skills because players just don't attack and just shoot especially with the mace, there needs to be limits set such as players must reset view before entering game or fights or something like that, also when you grab a weapon with both hand you hand slide up and down the hilt can that be fixed? otherwise the game is really fun when not matched with toxic players and doing campaign  also the classes are really cool, if you want a sword or melee fighting game this is it just don't take advantage of the game. Thank You.","May 10, 2021 at 3:04 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 20:08:54.775987,DeathByTwon,VERY FUN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.PLEASE READ,"when you first load in i def recommend going to the campaign menu and playing a tutorial or two with a few different classes, each one has its own play style             (personally im a bad@ss samurai) some classes do have a major advantage over other but the game is generally balanced and it just comes down to skill and practice. The up close swinging/blocking is in slow motion and every weapon has a ranged attack(which are not done in slo-mo) You also have energy and eveyr attack takes up an amount of energy but you can charge it back up based on how high your health is during anypoint of the fight. Multiplayer is really fun its 1v1 duels, about 98% of players dont talks so dont worry about chatting while you fight to the death! you will run into players worse than you and players better than you DONT BLAME THE GAME. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH IT I HAVE IS THE MONK. you can spin the staff and it will forever spin when you let go and is very very hard to block unless you have a sheilded character. anyways hope this helps some people decide whether or not they want the game. HOPE TO SEE MORE PLAYERS! - Antwon","May 2, 2021 at 3:41 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:08:54.790946,tiktok_fwtzkis,Awesome game! Just one minor flaw,"This is the best vr pvp by far! The only problem that I have with it is when people back up really far, just to the edge of the boundary so I cant hit them. My room is tiny so I cant step forward very far before punching my wall. I would love to see if they made the boundary smaller so that wouldnt happen. Everything else is awesome, I defininetly recommend this game for everyone.","Apr 2, 2021 at 9:26 AM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 20:08:54.805907,ShadeWing7,Fantastic Game,"I absolutely love the idea of this game. I personally practice swordsmanship and other martial weapon fighting irl, so to be able to play a game that mirrors those skills in VR is fantastic. Love every bit of this game, well worth the money.","May 2, 2021 at 4:44 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 20:08:54.835827,CommandTM,Best VR Fighting Game,"This is a great be game, the campaign is great with lots of stuff to do, and the multiplayer is fun to go up against each other. I would give it 5 stars, but some of the classes are over power. This is a really good, not that well known game.","Feb 3, 2021 at 4:22 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 20:08:57.942145,MightyMouse_,the people make this game not fun,this game would be awsome if there wernt so many monk and berserker spamers and you cant forget the ninjas... these 3 classes need a debuff. and the berserker needs to be slower,"Dec 5, 2020 at 11:22 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 20:08:57.956616,DarkGrisen,Only good VR Fighting game I know,"This is probably the best and the only good VR fighting game that I know of and the devs listen to the community a lot.

Some may think that slowmotion is stupid but that's the thing that makes the game playable. It's a genius idea! You can turn off slowmotion in a Private Match to see how it would be. Trust me, it's no fun without slowmotion.","Aug 13, 2020 at 6:47 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 20:08:57.972573,Ranzy,Amazing,"This is THE best VR game Ive ever played (well not sure about the best but certainly the most addicting.) once you learn the basics and get a feel for the game, its hard to stop playing!","Dec 30, 2020 at 8:39 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:08:57.986536,bboybenny7,really fun but the AI are overpowered,"this game is really fun and is top rated in my opinion, but the bots are too overpowered in my opinion, they can be beaten but it's pretty hard since they have tracking. but overal an amazing and fun game.

edit: bruh theres a game breaking glitch that  makes  me take 100 damage overtime, i just die and it's unplayable","Jul 31, 2020 at 3:00 PM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 20:09:01.111280,CrotchWizard,Fun but unbalanced,"I have enjoyed this game very much so far, some classes are very unbalanced. Knight is my favorite class but if I go up against a monk I can do nothing for defense. I have to pull my sword behind me and drop my guard to recharge while they relentlessly staff spin which recharges almost instantly.","Apr 10, 2020 at 11:15 AM",4, 34,
2022-05-28 20:09:01.127237,MrSpudzz,Holy unbalanced.,Did the devs even play the game before they released it? if you dont have the rapier your loose lol. Wait for updates this game is not worth it yet. even the solo play feels super broken. In my opinion the slow mo ruins the entire game. If it was realtime with weapon breaking it would feel way better. 2 stars cause there is potential.,"Apr 10, 2020 at 7:04 AM",2, 31,
2022-05-28 20:09:01.142198,altimos,good but need balance,"The game as a fantastic flow, it's super immersive and pleasnt to play while havinga decent multiplayer... if the sheild wasn't that powerfull...

At the moment, all the weapon deal the same damage but they don't hit as easly... For now, all sheild are broken cause they never break even if they are meant too and they are impenatrable defence when you just point them toward your enemy  weapon where you need to bring back your weapon behind you for all other weapon.

Sheild would be okay if they came with weaker damage... but it's not the case, I moslty think about crusader who as the biggest sheild, a weapon not that easy to stop, and the best ranged attack on the game.

Only time will show if the dev are the kind who listen to feedback or not. and this will decid if this game as potential or not.","Apr 17, 2020 at 7:33 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 20:09:01.156160,REIZOD,Fun Game Worth the Price!,Overall I like this game.  It needs improvments with some of the weapon spamming.  Though I enjoy most of the combat!  It does seem like some of my MA background helps with the duels.  Though it would be nice to have a non-slow-mo mode.  I would've given 5 stars if the Devs had leaderboards or some way to track my combat record.,"Apr 11, 2020 at 1:14 PM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 20:09:01.171120,Krillhouse,Good fun,"As others have said, it's not meant to be a realistic sword fighting game. It's got some strategy to it in managing your attacks/energy. The weapons all play very differently and have unique ranged attacks too. It's good fun, duels are tough, and hopefully there'll be more content to come down the track.","Apr 10, 2020 at 3:58 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 20:09:04.254031,Diverdn,Love this game!!,"I'vewated to play a VR game that allows you to practice using a sword. I liked star wars games like Vader Immortal and Blade and Socery, but the fighting was either too glitchy or too 1 dimensional. This does have some problems with the bow staff, but i still like the style, the combat, as well as the blocking and parrying. I constantly find myself having fun because it allows me to level up without freezing, like Blade and Sorcery, but less frustrating with glitches, such as Vader.","Apr 25, 2020 at 9:52 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:09:04.268991,stusmith78,Horribly unbalanced,"The game itself is very fun if you can get the hang of it, however, it is too unbalanced to be a truly fun game. For, example, the ninja is practically useless agaisnt any classes that have shields, the monk is too fast to block for most people without shields. The game needs balancing urgently. I want to give it five stars and say it's without flaw, I really do, but right now it's too unbalanced to do that.","Apr 17, 2020 at 10:40 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 20:09:04.283951,ehi10,one of thebst vr gams ever!,the combat feels so smooth and nice! My only complaint is the cruisaders sheild is to large and the staff for the monk is too fast reacharging.,"Jun 1, 2020 at 1:24 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:09:10.544235,IwanKrusenstern,En garde!,"There are very few decent Sword fighting games for VR and only two sword fighting games for the Quest, with Ironlights being the only one offering duels (The other one, Swords of Gargantua, feels less polished, and no duels). I used to do fencing myself and this game does capture the vibe pretty well. It is the first game that I bought on release.
The game graphics are of course rather minimalistic, evidently designed with the Quest hardware in mind. On the Quest it runs very smoothly.  
Have to disagree with the reviews that say the game is unbalanced. You just have to figure out whether to attack from afar or from up close, and whether your class is better at one or the other. I very rarely leave reviews, but for this game I had to put pen to paper, as it is really good.
 Can’t wait to kick YOUR behinds in an online duel. En garde!","Apr 18, 2020 at 12:11 AM",5, 4,

My Initial Thoughts:
I have never been a fan of 1V1 style games, but this one has a unique twist with it's battle mechanics. It plays more like a strategy game than a brawler.","Apr 15, 2020 at 11:19 PM",3, 0,
