2022-05-28 17:09:29.707044,Jesseryte,Disappointing,"Couldn't use movement controls, couldn't select anything, couldn't get a menu or start a tutorial.  Was stuck in the shack you spawn into when you start it up.  Was using a Rift S the first time, later used Revive and the Vive Cosmos.  Wuoldn't work for either of them.",Feb 26 at 5:26 AM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 17:09:29.736964,flyfisho,FRUSTRATING,"This game has potential. Mostly frustrating as being a fisherman the catching of fish in the game is not like real life. there is no drag on the real. the game tells you to put your rod down when fighting a fish and thats not how to fish. I fought the fish as if i would in real life and kept breaking the line. couldnt understand why?
Look if the game lasts long enough without freezing and having to kill it with task manager it could be OK if adjustments are made.
some bugs in it with the interactions with the bait tanks and kill tanks.
Ide be pretty dissapointed if i paid for it.",Oct 17 at 3:16 PM,1, 8,
