2022-05-28 16:17:23.750347,quester99,Great idea not ready for Oculus Quest,"As someone else mentioned the video quality was not very good in Quest. If I looked at my monitor (which mirrored what the headset saw), the video quality was very good. Once VR headsets gets higher resolutions this will be more worable. Oh yeah, it also took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to launch an episode. Turns out you look at the episode you want and press A on the controller. Also I downloaded instead of streaming and once it completed I was back at the menu to stream or download. Needs some tlc to be more user friendly","Apr 7, 2020 at 8:04 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:17:23.765306,ScooterCooter,Big Improvement,"I finally updated my motherboard, CPU, and RAM. I reinstalled Windows 10. Now, it works. Looks pretty awesome. I hope Cirq du Soliel can recover from the corona virus problem. Maybe they could make more VR videos, and sell them. Some of the other stuff on here by Felix and Paul looks good, too.","May 26, 2020 at 11:30 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 16:17:26.905906,Red_Go,not even watchable,"I'm pretty sure most of the people who gave this app 5 stars just because they never saw this circus before.  The amuzement of this app is tatally based on the circus itself not VR experience at all.  First, the resolution is less than VHS video tape.  It's not even the level of considering 'immersive', it's just unwatchable.  I've tried all of episodes, couldn't finish any of them.  Second, just 360 degree video without 3D depth in VR is so stupid idea.  The core of video content is the intention of where to see.  If a video was made without any idea or intention where the audience to see, audience would get lost.  Surround all circus performance 360 degree and put the audience in the center....  it sounds great but the truth is all the audience can do is just constant spining around to see what's going on.  This kind of application should be made not by a movie maker or any one who's in video making industry, it should be made my some one who loves VR and knows exactry what VR can (and should) do.  I'm not going to request refund for this app just to see if it gets reasonable update in the future so I can at least finish watching it.","Sep 19, 2019 at 5:57 AM",1, 21,
2022-05-28 16:17:26.920866,AliciaroseM,Breathtaking!,"Where to start? At first I was confused that the package is $5 on the store page and $8.99 in game. I sprung for the $5 and figured if it didn't work, I would then get the 8.99 version. The game kept trying to load the unpaid version. I deleted both and reinstalled from my library. Still, it was the unpaid version. Quit the app, back to my library and there was still a download button. I then downloaded a second smaller time. Then the program worked. I opted to also download the experiances (available in the game) instead of streaming. It took about 5 to 8 minutes per download. After this, my daughter and I were ready to watch. Each of the 4 performances are very different and unique! The only one I was not super impressed with was Ka: The Battle Within. It felt like a dance battle to me and was not filled with the amazing acrobatics, contortionism, and showmanship of the other 3. Through the Masks of LUZIA was insanely good! I would have gladly paid $5 just for that one experience! At times the graphics did seem to stutter a bit, but it kinda fit into the theme of being decades ago and didn't really bother me at all. All in all, I am happy with the experience and would purchase more episodes if they see fit to come out with them. Also, I have never seen the show in person, I would have loved to see a section to browse on the history, some photos/bios and information tidbits of the Cirque Du Soleil up to now. Sure I can google, but having it in my Rift at that moment would have been awesome.","Jun 12, 2019 at 11:59 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:17:30.067450,Karpsson,Impressive!,"I was sceptical about that app. But even after first show (there are four shows) I understood that 5$ for that show is nothing. 
Imagine that you are sitting in the center and they are around you, presenting something, just like you are very special guest, the circus is open just for you. You cannot see them at once, you need to turn your head. That means that one time watching is not enoughfor checking all the dancers, acrobats and clowns. And that’s amazing. 
I absolutely recommend that app.

To developers: guys, video doesn’t represent the full potential of the app. I don’t know how you can improve that but you would get me much faster if video would represent your app better. ;-)
Good luck guys! 

P.S. I can’t wait for more shows (as in-app purchases, ofc! The price is already extremely low, there’s no need to add free content). 
Thank you for that great performance!","Mar 3, 2019 at 2:09 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:17:30.082410,LBoogie6057,Stops and Starts..,"I really love this experience .. when it works. I think I have watched one show all the way through (and it was AMAZING).. when I try and watch any of the others.. I get a few minutes in before the white circle and hourglass and then taken back to the dashboard! UGH..so sucks since I think this is one of the best VR app on OR! 
Please fix it and add more content!","Apr 8, 2019 at 7:55 AM",3, 1,"Hi LBoogie6057, thanks for letting us know about this.

2022-05-28 16:17:30.097370,stankodl,Have never been able download,"Very disappointing that its been over a year and I'm still unable to download after purchasing  Not one time! Error messages.  Frustrating reading reviews and the reply from Oculus is to send the app designer an email and provide all that info about one's equipment -- seems like the burden is put on the purchaser--perhaps Oculus as the Seller of the program should have the App designer reach out to the consumer! -- I would much rather have my money refunded, esp if I have been unsuccessful in watching 1x.  Obviously there's an issue with quite a few users.   This experience, along with a few select others that refuse to play/download, have made me think twice about ordering any new content or any other purchases from the Oculus store.","Jun 20, 2019 at 11:48 AM",1, 2,"Hi Stan, we're sorry to hear this.

2022-05-28 16:17:30.112330,JonnyTenebrous,Great Evening's Entertainment - Unique!,"I would absolutely love to see more performances of this nature on my Oculus Rift... it's the best way to take in a show, short of flying to Vegas. 
 I'm giving this one five stars based on the balance of cost and quality.  £4 for an evening's utterly unique entertainment, and an experience worth revisiting and sharing - brilliant!  There are four quality, highly varied performances - each maybe just under 10 minutes in length.  You're place right in the centre of the action, and there are layers to the performances - there are new things to experience on a second or even third watchthrough as you can't pay attention to everything that's happening at once.  Some people are experiencing system performance issues, therefore docking the reviews.  My system is a modest 2012 era i7 with 16gb ram and a mid-range Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, running all software from an SSD drive - everything ran beautifully without a single hitch.  I did spend the extra time to *download* each performance rather than streaming them and, if you have the available time and drive space, I recommend you do the same as the quality is much greater and more consistent.","Feb 12, 2019 at 8:03 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:17:30.127290,Suspend,,I really wish I could get this to work.  I LOVE Cirque du Soleil but this is an embarassment for the Oculus store.  I've tried to watch this maybe 20 or 30 times and it's worked 2 of those times.  I generally start the app and come back in 5 or 10 minutes and see if the white circle is still spinning.  1 out of every 20 tries I'll get the menu.  From there I MAY be able to watch streaming....or the app might crash.  50/50 chance of each.  Download has never worked.  This app should be repaired or removed from the store.,"Jan 12, 2019 at 3:53 PM",1, 13,"Hi Suspend, thanks for letting us know about this issue.

Over 45 minutes top quality experience for this price as a bargain. Some people had problems with running this experience(bless them) that why few one start reviews which affect the rating, however on my Oculus rift runs perfectly. From me well deserved 5 out of 5.","Jan 15, 2019 at 11:14 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 16:17:33.272877,suhrick,"Best Thing on VR So Far (For me, anyway)","Four different Cirque routines, tweaked specifically for VR.  Not just a recording of their shows but four shortish subsets of a show with the artists playing directly to the VR camera (in other words, you).  It is very intense and be sure to watch each several times as the action occurs 360 degrees around you.  

Strongly recommended for amyone who wants more than simple bang-bang-shootem-up VR entertainment.","Dec 16, 2018 at 11:25 AM",5, 8,
