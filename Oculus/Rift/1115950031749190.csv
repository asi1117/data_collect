2022-05-28 12:30:06.695683,bongodoctor,Brilliant Spy Themed Escape Room Game!,"Even though this is quite an old game it is really fun to play and quite challenging, requiring a lot of lateral thinking and improvisation. It is a Bond themed game, but I imagine it would be fun even if you are not into the spy genre. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there is no way to rotate your view using the controllers with an Oculus headset and I play in a very tight space with limited mobility. This meant it was very difficult and quite painful to try to twist around so I could access items that were just behind me. I don't imagine it is likely they will add such a feature, but I am sure many people would appreciate it. I was also unable to reset my progress so that someone else could play the game from the start without uninstalling and re-installing it. That said it is a really good game and for the price I would definitely recommend it - if you have space to sit on a swivel chair and rotate then it will be an even better experience. And you should expect to die many times! It was hilarious just how many ways there were to die, and I laughed out loud each time...",Feb 10 at 12:27 AM,4, 6,
2022-05-28 12:30:06.710642,Hamergear,Exceptional VR experience!,This is a good game for someone that does not have their VR legs. Puzzles are challenging but not overly so. My only complaint is no option for multiple save slots. Yes I know other players can change reels in the main office to play the various puzzles and the controler tutorial. Just would be nice to have the exprerance streamlined for new players without resetting the game data. Other than that fantastic game!,Dec 31 at 3:24 AM,5, 31,
2022-05-28 12:30:06.725603,agentplaza,Awesome & accessible to disable players,I love this game despite that I do indeed need to speed up the solution I found to the second mission. But what I love the most is that is that it is 100% accessible to persons with disabilities and that is rare in the VR world but getting better. Thank you for a game for all that is also awesome.,Nov 12 at 7:39 AM,5, 32,

2022-05-28 12:30:06.755523,Millenium2809,Take your five stars,"This game is honestly amazing, it's one of those rare games that actually have smart achievements. It's the dumbest ones sometimes but I love it. The speedrun achievements make you want to replay the levels to get every single thing right (For now I only managed to get one of those).

The story itself is taken right out of an 80s spy movie. It's dull in every aspect but god is it ever so funny. The most random situations can happen, and you can literally do anything. Props to the devs for finding that many ways to die, mustn't have been easy. 

The last mission is the most brilliant in my opinion, always give a salute at it's ending, it's a great thing to do (no spoilers). The game actually makes you use your brain to get an idea on how to get situations accomplished. It's basically an escape game in VR except you don't escape, it's the doc that's trying to escape from you. I really hope a second game will be done, and will be just as good as the first. I want to get doc down.

But, they expect you to die.",Aug 3 at 7:56 PM,5, 39,"You're in luck, Agent. I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy and The Liar just launched on August 24, 2021!

2022-05-28 12:30:09.903224,XRAY47-,This game is incredible,"honestly, i find alot of vr games to lack effort put into them , most enviroment arent interactive aside from what you are meant to touch, this game is different, if you can see you you can grab it and all items have multiple functions, what would be a static object in another game can be a knife, a hammer or a bomb in this game, it has excellent puzzles that really get you mind to work hard to figure out and leave you feeling like you iq went up 20 points when you finally get them, the narrator is a great addition to the mission and really makes the game stand out from others, and to top it off you can grab your cigar with telekenetic powers sit back and brandish your gun in the secret agent office, definatley worth the purchase, i wish i could play it again without knowing what you have to do, but i can still go back and find all the hidden things in the game.","Jun 15, 2021 at 3:11 AM",5, 28,

2022-05-28 12:30:13.110774,SpaceTurd,I LOVE this game!,"If you don't want to read this review, this game is fun to play, especially if you enjoy Puzzle/escape room type games. I normally don't even enjoy this type of game, but each level got me thinking and made me feel clever when I worked it out. The way you move items whilst sitting down is great (and the developer commentary is also very interesting). The story is simple but also great, and the fact that this game gets updates for new levels (for free) every now and then is an extra bonus! I got this game back in 2018, and I still come back to it to replay it every few months. It's very fun.","Nov 20, 2020 at 5:01 AM",5, 72,

The answers arent always as they seem, sometimes they are just so blunt and funny, other times they are harder. If you want to get the most out of this time don't use youtube unless you absalutly have to, spend time trying to figure it out, I made that accident playing through the first time, but they added new stuff and that mad it so I could try to do it on my own and not use youtube, it is deffinitally better if you dont cheat, and it takes long, (sorry for the ru n on sentence!)","Jun 23, 2020 at 1:33 PM",5, 23,
2022-05-28 12:30:19.381750,Kiminoth,"Clever, witty, and now I want more!","I purchased this after seeing the reviews, watching a couple videos and I was curious to see how it was. I was definitely not disappointed. 

In the role of a spy-agent, you're tasked with completing various puzzles, heavily reminiscant of escape rooms (which is what it basically is), trying to complete various situations.... while trying not to die. Emphasis on trying. 

While there were definitely some points where I felt frustrated at having to start the level all over again (which is what happens when you die), the length of each level is arguably perfect, being not too short that you feel like it's over before it began, but long enough that when you die it's not the worst feeling to start all over again. 

Not only that, the levels are constructed in such a way that they often make you leave a scenario feeling 'cleverer' than when you started, and it's a rewarding experience. 

From start to finish, it took around 2-3 hours to complete. For the price and the experience, I would say that would be about what I expect to pay, if not more. I've not really had the ability to compare a game to a real life activity, but comparatively, if you compare the cost of this with a real life escape room, a 2-person escape room for 1hr down the road costs $84 AUD, and I would argue this is a lot more fun and lasts longer! 

There is additional replayability with a achievement system, called 'souvenirs', and dev comments become available after the first complete run through. 

I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a light-hearted VR puzzle type challenge.","Jun 6, 2020 at 12:32 PM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 12:30:32.014519,Comrade_Ivan,Hilarious!,"Brilliant!

To any frustrated users new to the game (like I was), just know there are multiple ways to solve each puzzle. 

I was initially frustrated with the perceived ""it's this way or the highway"" gameplay. But once I realized there's quite a bit of flex with solving individual problems, the game became immensely fun.

The only downside is that interactions somehow reinforce the feeling this is just an illusion; that you're in a VR experience. It's hard to point a finger at it, but something just feels clunky.

Regardless, if you like escape rooms, I say get it and stick with it; you'll be glad you did.","Jan 6, 2020 at 3:04 AM",4, 7,

The interaction with objects is almost perfect, the only downside (for me) is the fact that the hands disappear when you grab something but doesn't affect gameplay. Is probably one of the best VR titles to show to your friends that never played VR and have a laugh seeing how they start burning the books in the office. 

Don't pay attention to the 1,2 or 3 starts reviews, as developers keep adding new levels from time to time making it fun to go back and see what new puzzle has been added. After all this time still trying to add new stuff says a lot about the developers, really well done guys.

2022-05-28 12:30:44.719527,Xeeq,Bugged since latest update,"This is a great game, when it works.  It's been completely unplayable because of a bug since the latest update that added the new room.  Whenever you turn the game on, you are sitting in front of the projector and completely unable to interact with anything.  I've uninstalled multiple times.  I even deleted my saved game data and worked my way back up to the new level.  I started it up today to finally play the new level.....bugged again.....can't play.   I can't find anything on Google about this.  Ugh.....so annoying.  I'll update my review once the game becomes playable again.  As for now.....it's a completely unplayable 1-star game.

Update following dev response:
The developer accidentally released the new room early.  Instead of releasing an update that rolled the game back and also rolled the users saved game back, the dev only rolled the game back and allowed a game-breaking bug from the new room update make their game unplayable.  Here is a copy/paste of their lazy, sorry solutions from their support page:  
""There are two options that you can try to get the game in a working state.
First - Wipe all save progress
Second - Save your progress until the new level is released""

I'm, of course, refering to to the June 2019 rollback that was done towards the game.  The solutions are just 1) not what I would would want to do and 2) just don't work.  I've read comments about this on the store page and on Reddit about the solutions not working for a number of people.

My one question is this.  Why can't the devs just fix what they broke instead of waiting for the July update?  I don't want to restart my game because I'm still working on the achievements.  Both solutions on the support page are not what I want to do for any achievement hunter.

What's there is impecably put together and really shows what's possible with puzzle solving games in VR.  The execution of the game is perfect and won't cause anyone nausea issues, only perhaps some frustration struggling with some of the puzzles.  But that's a good thing with games like this!  The settings are great fun, the voice acting is good, it's like someone turned No One Lives Forever (the game, if you remember it) and made it a VR puzzler, which is high praise.

It's got some replay value in the achievements too, many of which are puzzles in themselves (how to get them).

There are several reviews that complains about how ""unintuitive"" and how easily you die and had to start over.. Dude.. it's a puzzle game and.. read the title! So far none of the complains are valid because it's like saying ""the downside of the game is that there are enemies you have to kill"" these are the points of the game.

Down side: The app did not save my progress properly - I was forced to redo a mission I had already completed in the last session.  Worse, for some reason the very last step would not complete and I would have to do the whole mission over again. After a couple of attempts, I ran out of patience. 

And that's another frustrating thing - if you make a mistake on one step, you'll have to do everything over again to get back to that same point. 

I would suggest to the developers to:
1. Fix the Progress issue, so you don't have to redo a mission

2022-05-28 12:31:22.702914,TheKovar,"""I Expect You To Die"" At a Glance~","Content: 
You play as a spy that's a part of an agency that stops criminal masterminds. You're agency has it's sights set on a one particularly evil guy. The game is full of puns, quick time solutions, and numerous possibilites to the objectives for each puzzle. But, in reality, they expect you to die. (*Insert Laugh Track Here*)

Play Time: 
I finished the game just within 3 hours. (Without recieving all of the achievments.)

Final Thoughts:
I had a blast playing the game. The humor was bright an uplifting and the puzzles kept you on your toes. I plan on going back and achievment hunting the rest of the achievments. I think the game may be a bit overpriced when it isn't on sale, but when it's discounted, I would totally recommend it.

The below original review applies if you can get the game to work.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

A well polished game that clearly has been created by an excellent team. I liked the fact I could relax and do this sitting rather than jumping around for a change. You can grab objects with your virtual hands, but also you can select them by pointing and dragging them closer. There are several different scenarios and I found them all highly entertaining. Difficult enough to make you work at it, but not too difficult you have to search youtube for a walkthrough. Spot on. Why only 4 stars? As alluded to be another review, this game could be longer. However, on sale it really is a no brainer. Get it, enjoy it, share it.
Oh and I have watched the titles at the beginning all the way through multiple times. I never thought I would do that with any game in my life. Superb graphic style and soundtrack. Very impressive!","Jun 15, 2019 at 12:06 AM",1, 3,"Hi Bruce-

This isn't value for money, even in a complete your collection package. Ok, the end credits say they will be back but with what? if it's DLC for free then fine but I don't think that will be the case. Indeed, the original release was only four levels on release and one additional level has been added. Thats working out way too expensive, especially as once you have completed the missions there is little replay value to the game.

If you die... and you will die... it's in the title for heaven sakes... you have to start the mission over. I found this enjoyable but I was reading that others found that part annoying. Oh well. You will be sitting down on a chair for the missions so you don't have to have a huge playing space. Missions have objectives to unlock so you can replay them if you are an achiever. This is a short game though... just know that going in so you aren't dissapointed.,"Dec 8, 2017 at 4:03 AM",5, 1,

The puzzles are unique and require some logic most of the time. Occassionally, you need to think quick and the game puts you on the spot, with seconds to spare. Fail that and you'll die in seconds. Ultimately, you'll find it's a case of tried and tested methods if you don't figure it out straight away. It's good to remember that an object may appear useless, but if used correctly can be the solution to your problem. This game thinks outside the box slightly, so think the same. Brilliant game.

2022-05-28 12:32:22.947556,cScottD,My Absolute Favourite VR Game!,"Even before you get into the actual game, it's fun just picking up things in the office and doing things to/with them -- Which leads to the other big plus: It has the best, and most quickly intuitive, control scheme of any VR game I've played. The ability to pick up things that are out of your physical reach and ""pull"" them to you, along with the ""ghosted outline"" for objects that are behind/under other objects is simply genius. I've played other games (that I otherwise liked) that became frustrating because an object fell or rolled just out of reach, or dropped behind another object.

Another big plus for me personally, is that it really can be played seated (which unfortunately is an absolute requirement for me). Some other games that list as being playable while sitting either require you to be able to swivel around (like in an office chair) or stand up occasionally to reach/grab some items -- neither of which is an option for me. Admittedly, I'm probably in a very tiny minority of players in that regard, but your game plays so flawlessly while seated that it makes we wish that some of the other games that *almost* work seated could take a lesson from you.

Next up, the gameplay itself. I love a good puzzle game, and at their core, that's what the missions actually are: puzzles. Puzzles wrapped up inside a very cool spy theme, and puzzles where you have to die (repeatedly) in order to figure them out -- Which brings me to another plus. Dying is fun. There are so many entertaining ways to die, and it's such an integral part of the game, that it (almost) never becomes frustrating.

Some honourable mentions: The fully immersive ""feel"" of the environment. The incredible attention to detail. Having multiple solutions to many obstacles. Adding items to the office as you complete missions. The voice that talks you through all the missions (who is great, by the way). That INCREDIBLE opening sequence and fantastic theme song. Everything. Seriously, everything.","Sep 11, 2017 at 5:50 AM",5, 3,

The designers really took their time to figure out how to make this an accessible, comfortable, and fun experience with seated VR. With the Oculus Touch controllers, everything felt natural so quickly. The only thing that was slightly unusual was in the control scheme for ""pulling"" an item to you, but you do figure it out after some trial and error.

That said, the quality of this game is outstanding. The environments are great, the puzzles are fun and enjoyable, and the voice acting and polish are terrific. This is the game I get everyone to try after the Oculus intro, because it's so interactive and easy to get into. People are laughing and get fully immersed into VR so quickly in this game. I really hope they come out with a Sequel!

I'd like to give it four stars, simply because it needed about two more levels to feel complete - it was just a bit too short and I was ready for a final tough mission, when I realized that it was over instead.

Deep, rich and varied interactions throughout. Achievements for a little bit of replay value. There really is much to recommend here. Even a couple of missteps with the occasionally frustrating unclear puzzle, or clumsy interaction don't damage the experience.

Works brilliantly with touch, even if there's sometimes deadly ambiguity with closely overlapping hitzones. For example, why would I ever want to pull the pin on a grenade that I'm not holding?

There is a major cost to all this love and attention to detail however. Just four scenarios, one of which is virtually unchanged from the DK2 demo, simply isn't enough content for the amount being charged.

You'll read everywhere that's it's short, and it is. But there is so much polish in it, that it justifies the price tag in my eyes. The intro scene is just a VR masterpiece. The missions are fun, all different one from another and the puzzles are smart without being too hard.

If you're not judging a book by its size relative to its price, you're going to have a great time.","Dec 13, 2016 at 8:36 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:33:20.107914,feny_q,Amazing game... but it's too short.,The title really says it all. It's probably my favorite launch title for Touch but it's too short. I think a $10 or $15 price tag would have been more fitting. If they would have included 4 more levels it would have been an easy 5 stars.,"Dec 11, 2016 at 5:01 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 12:33:23.215689,freinhar54,Very good,"I don't think I would have picked this up if it wasn't part of the Touch Launch Bundle, but I'm glad it was included - very fun! I do struggle with the scale, especially while seated. My play area is not that small, but I still find myself bumping into the boundaries - though this is avoidable if you make liberal use of the telekinesis ability.","Dec 13, 2016 at 9:34 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 12:33:23.234638,Myran22,"A must-buy, but a bit short","An incredibly clever and fun game, that regretfully ends much too early. The content that is there is of the highest quality, however, and the puzzles are clever without becoming annoyingly difficuly. The different achievments and ways to solve puzzles makes it a joy to replay. Highly recommended.","Dec 13, 2016 at 6:39 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 12:33:23.289492,yodastories,More Please!,Wonderful experence and game.  This game is fantastic.  You get to feel like you are 007 solving puzzles to escape impossible situations.  One of the more polished VR experences.  They really knocked this out of the park.  I only wish it had more levels and more extra's.  Like everyone else has said - takes around 2 hr to finish.  If you love puzzles and 007 this game is a must buy!  Seriously why are you still reading this review - go buy it!,"Dec 12, 2016 at 9:31 AM",5, 0,

Wonderfully crafted and lovely portrayal of the characters.  However, I did want a little more for the current asking price (£18 GBP), suggesting £12 would have been a better start.","Dec 12, 2016 at 4:07 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 12:33:26.405799,McWeakballs,IEYTD is way too short for the price,"This game is incredibly fun and polished. The escape room idea translates well into VR when woven with a story like these are. It's clear the developers spent a lot of time on this game. The problem? When it came out on the other side there just wasn't that much there. 

$25 for a couple of hours of entertainment when there are $12-$15 games on the store that give ENDLESS replayability is pretty unacceptable. 

I feel the vast majority is willing to accept VR games as ""demos"" and ""betas"" and ""ideas"" because of it's infancy but we need to wake up. $12.50/hour for an experience, albeit as much fun as this one is, is a complete rip off. You spend a lot of time in this game burning money with lighters or in fire places, and when the credits rolled on this one I felt like I did just that. Burned my money.","Dec 12, 2016 at 2:24 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 12:33:26.423751,jmalmsten,A great little puzzler. But too short,"The puzzles weren't too hard, though I felt a bit stumped a couple of times, but then I remembered that this is basically a point n click adventure and therefore a certain level of outside the box thinking is required. The only main thing I can complain about is what everyone else says. More levels please!","Dec 10, 2016 at 2:52 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 12:33:26.441702,chaugi,Really awesome,"Yes a but short, but maybe they will release DLC with extra misisons. Touch support is great. Missions are fun and amuzing.

2022-05-28 12:33:26.460652,barackus,A very well designed seated puzzle game,"The controls work really well, the puzzles are entertaining and challenging, and the sense of presence is amazing. You really feel like 007 trying to escape a room, or solve a puzzle. This really is a must have. The only downside is that there's not more of it. Every level has ""achievements"" which requires you to really explore the level and all its possibilities.","Dec 9, 2016 at 8:16 AM",5, 1,
