2022-05-28 18:47:26.199076,MintyFries,Quite the experience,"I adore this game.  The controls are, as many have pointed out, oftentimes picky.  But if you really focus, you can pull off the powers you are trying to pull off.  You just can't be careless is all.  Some of the powers you get are really nifty, the procedural generation is fun (most of everything is quite barren but it's impressive for what it is.  There are several real-world landmarks present on the earth here).  The flight is fun and feels quite a bit more free and speedy than many other universe-exploring games.  It very often makes you feel like a super hero.  A major complaint is that the battles are often extremely difficult to figure out, and you'll fail many missions before figuring out what you have to do to defeat each new alien ship.  You'll find yourself saying, why are these bombs suddenly causing huge explosions and leveling the city, only to realize, the ships now drop both large and tiny bombs, and you have to throw the large bombs into the sky where they'll do no damage, and instead throw the tiny bombs at the alien ships.  Get ready for a lot of those moments.",Aug 4 at 7:03 AM,5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:47:29.359622,Corwii,I love it!,"I was really on the fence about picking this up seeing quite a few bad reviews. But if this is the kind of game you want to experience, buy it. It's very immersive and really makes you feel like a super hero trying to save as many people as possible. You also have to avoid causing harm yourself as missing shots with your powers can cause people to die. This game really shows the true meaning of the responsibility a super hero faces. And just because you have a certain power, doesn't mean you should use it as it can destroy life as you know it. The controls were most of the bad reviews here, but I have no problem with them. Controls can be adjusted to suit your needs. Trust me, reaching your arms out and flying at break neck speeds is truly a wonderful experience though your arms can get tired after a while.

2022-05-28 18:47:29.418465,edgecrush3r,Brilliant and immersive!,Wow.. This game has been in my top-10 for a long time. The game mechanics and the sense of immersion is huge and never expirienced on this scale. I absolutely love this game and hope the Dev will add more. But even as its stands right now. Its a brilliant game that deserves to be on your game list.,"Dec 24, 2019 at 7:21 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:47:32.542110,miker00lz,Amazing idea! Worth a try.,"This really gives you a taste of what it's like to be a superhero. The atmosphere is excellent! It's a great idea, and while it's fun to experiment with the mechanics and fly around like Superman, the rest of the execution leaves a bit to be desired.

I understand that this is an indie game, and has nowhere near the resources of a AAA game studio, but I want to be honest in my review. Just keep your expectations in check. The game is very unpolished.

The aiming mechanics are unintuitive. You angle your head to aim while initiating the throw of the weapon with your hand, and you have to think hard to coordinate that. It's a big immersion breaker. Naturally, you try to aim your throw by moving your hand at the angle you desire while holding the trigger, but it doesn't work that way.

Also, the instant jerking of your view when you move the right thumb stick to turn is very jarring. It takes you out of the action and reminds you that it's not real. It should be a smooth movement instead.

The graphics, especially at city level, are very boring. At high altitudes, it looks good but as you fly towards the earth and enter a city, it seems very bland and the color palette is just drab. It doesn't feel like a living city at all.

Those are my major gripes. If the dev(s) see this review, I seriously hope you take my comments to heart, because this could turn into something incredible.

My final thoughts are simple. If you can get this on sale, absolutely go for it! You will get a good 30 to 60 minutes of fun out of it.","Oct 19, 2019 at 1:46 PM",3, 19,
2022-05-28 18:47:32.557070,NuttleStuff,It deserves at least an overall 4 stars,"I would normally rate a game of this caliber at 4 stars, but I feel it has been underrated. I want to do my part in trying to up the overall ratings.  It definitely deserves a solid 4 stars for what you get in it's price range.  The only reason I would put it at 4 stars is because of a few issues I'll list below.  Pros: 1) An awesome open world that you can fly around and even enter low orbit, pretty incredible. 2) Several options to set the controllers to your preference while flying. 3) You can fly into combat or you can free roam to anywhere you want. You are not limited to a set of rules to follow 4) You can freaking feel like Superman or Superwoman! ;)  Cons: 1) Combat can be difficult due to accuracy, more specific, it's hard to hit the kill spots on the robots. (This may not be the case for everyone, ha.) 2) Graphics are on the low side, so it can be a bit blurry at times. It would be nice to have a bit more done in this area, but it's an Indie VR game, so I can't complain much.  This isn't a AAA title, so don't expect one. 3) Must manually turn off VR blinders, which are the black bars/halo around your vision when flying. Additionally, why isn't this under visuals rather than controls. I didn't even know I could turn this off until I stumbled across a review mentioning it. Final thoughts: It's worth picking up, especially on sale. Grab it if you want something to goof off with and get a semblance of what it feels like to fly. It's worth it for simply being able to fly around at freewill. It's really cool to be able to fly into low earth orbit and then zoom back down around the planet.  The developer did a good job implementing this into the game. I hope the developer takes some time to invest in updates. There is a lot of potential with this one.","Oct 19, 2019 at 9:11 AM",5, 15,

2022-05-28 18:47:32.587988,EddieNanakase,Fantastic underrated game !,"Ok, let me start with the cons.  The audio did mess up once after like three levels but it fixed itself once I respawned.  Yeah, this game doesn't have killer graphics nor good graphics.  There is a lot of blurriness to things all around.  I think that's the only con I have noticed until now.  Ok, now for the pros :  What I love about this game is that it delivers a very unique experience, makes you feel like a total bada(ss) !  You can fly from space into a city within seconds !  I think this is the reason why many things look blurry.  I mean, imagine what it takes an open world game to load sections of the game as you move through different sections.  If this game didn't have the blurriness and had more detail, we would have constant loading screens that would interrupt the feeling of having this crazy power of moving at crazy speeds through cities !  In my opinion, you don't need that much detail.  I feel like the developer made the right choice of choosing experince over graphics.  The music by the way is fantastic !  The music makes you feel like a bada(ss), makes you feel like you are in a movie !  I know I'm using a lot of exclamation marks, but the experience in this game is so awesome !  I just got tired of playing games with guns or bows, but this game delivered something different, a very unique experience.  It sometimes even makes me feel like I'm a Dragon Ball Z character (minus the melee attacks) just shooting powers at my enemies.  It makes you feel like a super hero, a very powerful super hero.  This game has a variety of enemies with unique abilities that have to be destroyed in different ways, never having a boring moment.  The story is very interesting as well, it keeps reeling you in and makes me feel like God is talking to me !  Even though the game is not very long (like most Oculus games) I would still highly recommend getting this game.  Great game to add to your library,  it's going to blow your mind away !","Oct 28, 2019 at 2:27 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:47:35.766486,MyWy,"Fun Game, Not the Best VR Port","""Superman simulator"" pretty much sums it up. Your character has incredible power - the trick is getting rid of the aliens without accidentally killing a bunch of mortals. The enemies have bright red target spots on them, which is a little cheesy. It's short but unique, and maybe worthwhile on sale.

I have been enjoying the game, but this might be better on the flat screen. You aim by looking at the target and gesturing. You might try to throw a plasma bolt up, but that's not the correct gesture - you just look up, and move your hand forward. It might as well be using the mouse and X button. Flying feels like your are using a mouse, and you can't go straight up or arching your back and go backwards a bit. It just doesn't feel totally free like I've come to expect from VR games.","Oct 20, 2019 at 9:04 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:47:38.879161,Pingpongchow,Ever wanted to fly like Superman?,"Impressive game, great concept but just falls short of 5 stars for 2 simple reasons.

1. the graphics even when set in-game to max and oculus over-ride supersampling at 2.0 makes zero difference, the game looks low quality/blurry.

2. the Touch controls work very well for flying and movement but feel so clunky and bad when using the gesture attacks.

This game is still a LOT of fun, the soundtrack is fantastic and you can't really argue for the small price, this is not AAA remember.

I am not disappointed with my purchase, there are some flaws but i eagerly await any future development of this title, a tweak in graphics quality would be amazing but not so much that it kills the smooth gameplay.","Oct 19, 2019 at 6:48 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 18:47:42.125478,TerrbearSF,"Mind blowing in VR, but needs fixes","Pentadimensional Games, as a game producer and connoisseur of all things mind blowing, I am constantly in awe of the vision and concept of this game. The team on this has created something special that I feel is a step away of polish from being a masterpiece. That's no hyperbole ...but (and here it comes) this PC port has some serious problems that progression stop and squander the true potential of what this game can become.

So here's my candid impressions...

Straight out of the gate the flying tutorial gave me goosebumps. It's rare a game does this for me. When this old jaded gamer in his 40's who often feels finding new game expeirences are dead - I stand here inspired at an experience that feels refreshing and innovative. Coupled with the soundtrack ""Aurora"" by David García Díaz with all its Hans Zimmer feels and Kaskade-like vocals is nothing short of outstanding epic grandeur! I'd give this game a 10 just on the soundtrack scoring work alone. Showing the opening moments of this game to friends really shows off VR and blows their minds.

Then the combat begins and the Oculus gesture controls is where the immersion and awe of this game starts feeling squandered and undermined by the implementation of poor and inconsistently designed gestures. Heat Wave gesture doesn't even work and needs its gesture changed. Not myself and any of the 5 others playing this today could get it to work right. With regular shooting we often found ourselves thrusting our hand forward with trigger pulled to shoot and nothing happens. This all definitely needs tweaking if non-gesture controls consistently work and I can score/rank better than I do with gestures on - this problem is an immersion killer for a VR experience.

The letterboxing effect around the headsets FOV reeks of ""this was ported from the PSVR experience"" and is not great at all. Also high-end PCs can use better texture resolutions.

Please continue to support and fix issues to make this game greater for PC VR!","Aug 20, 2018 at 4:34 AM",3, 88,

2022-05-28 18:47:48.485467,Shizzmoo,"Fun, but definitely need some patching","The game is a ton of fun! Flying around at high speeds, defending Earth by blasting aliens - and then hoping they don't dodge and you destroy an entire city block. Yes, you have to be careful of your own power making things worse for those you're trying to save! 

Couple points in the negative here though: 
1. The graphics are extremely blurry, no matter what settings I choose. Others have mentioned this as well, and it seems that OTT has no effect with supersampling.
2. Motion controls are kind of hard to get used to, mostly because it's an odd mix of head aiming and motion controller use. I wish they would have stuck with the immersive aspects, and got rid of the cross hair in the center of your screen for aiming at everything (menus are a pain especially). This just seems a little lazy. Also, the way you have to wiggle the controller perfectly while holding trigger down is just not very good when trying to fire blasts from your hands. It doesn't seem to work sometimes, or maybe I'm just not doing it perfectly? Wish this was more intuitive.
3. I should have probably mentioned this first, because its the BIGGEST problem for me: the black bars on the side of your screens that reduces FOV. This can't be turned off, even if you disable the VR Blinders setting - it's always there once you're in-game and won't go away; very immersion breaking.

All in all though, I can see this becoming an amazing VR game (especially for the price!) if they listen to feedback and fix a few things. It's still a TON of fun to play once you get used to the controls, and that alone makes it a 4 for me. It'd be a definite 5 if they can fix those 3 big issues I mentioned up top!","Aug 13, 2018 at 12:46 AM",4, 28,

Which just makes the issues I have all the more curious. But first, the good, the game is truly awe inspiring, being an all powerful superhero is just an amazing experience and the world is massive. There's nothing quite like it.

There are a number of visual oddities, like the volumetric smoke that seem to penetrate into the player's eyeballs, or the shader bugs that make some textures appear as if they exist on another plane of reality, both of which make this game somewhat uncomfortable to play especially in VR. Sometimes objects that should be behind my hands will also render in front of them, sometimes I can fall through the terrain, sometimes the camera will force itself into a position and almost make me throw up due to how jerky it is, the list goes on. Then there's the FOV, which is shockingly bad. It's like looking through a cardboard cutout, I don't know why the developer isn't using all the screen real estate available to them. So there's a number of technical hurdles that might be very difficult to leap over, I understand that.

However that's not where the issues end, the next is a bit less forgiveable. The gameplay. This game doesn't feel like it was designed for VR. It feels like it was ported to VR, without any rebalancing or refactoring to the gameplay. It's awkward to control, it's incredibly difficult for all the wrong reasons, the UI doesn't work properly in some cases, it's all a bit surreal. 

Anyway I've run out of room for this review which kind of sucks because I wanted to talk more about what's great about this game, but I feel like these issues are more important for any potential buyers.","Aug 16, 2018 at 5:29 PM",3, 17,
2022-05-28 18:47:51.579193,vz1123,Cool Game. Bad FOV?,"Cool game, great experience - as other reviews have explained. Graphics are pretty bad but understandable because the scale of this game is huge. One complaint I have is the FOV is incredibly bad and ruins the immersiveness. I feel like im looking at a square screen. Looked through settings but couldnt change it, is there anyway to increase this? Thanks.","Aug 25, 2018 at 5:08 AM",4, 8,

The concept is good, the buildings crumble well, and the screaming populus creates a nice atmosphere.  But... The textures are blurry, the controls don't feel great, and there seems to be no skill required to defeat the alien invaders. Just spam 'fire'.  Played for an hour and it just didn't grab me.","Aug 18, 2018 at 6:08 PM",2, 9,

Tutorial is horrible for figuring out powers as its all gestures, and its easy to forget something. A simple guide for already unocked powers would be great. Otherwise, for those who want to get out and explore the universe, man.......this is going to be a really.....really....REALLY long road trip for you. You're probably not going to see it all before you die, but thankfully most of it looks the same. I was just blown away by the sheer size of it all that it sent chills down my back. Really made me feel so small in the grand scheme of things. You also need to widen the field of view, I'm noticing the edges of the screen and its seriously annoying.","Aug 14, 2018 at 2:51 PM",4, 25,
2022-05-28 18:47:51.626067,Knyght,Very poor toturials,"Seriously annoyed with is game already and I've only played it for 5 minutes. It first asks if I want gesture control and doesn't explain what that is.
And after starting a new game I'm being taught to fly and it tells me to press RB to fly faster. I pressed every F'ing button on my Touch controller and nothing makes me go faster therefor I can not progress any further in the tutorial.","Aug 13, 2018 at 4:25 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 18:47:54.722785,Darakin,,"I was not sure what to expect after the reviews. There were lot of performance complaints. I can only say it runs smoothly on my computer.
The flying is incredible. I have done the tutorial and the first mission so far. (Just bought it)
The combats are really fast and you need be really good at controlling your flight.
But I expect nothing less from a game that is rated ""intense"" 
I would wish for the option to direct my flight not with my hand but also with eyetracking. You can turn with the head but feels not natural. Even if you turn on gesture control, you can still use buttons etc. 
But it is a lot of fun. Dont try to steer with both hands. You can use either one.
You have to be really fast for this game. Its easy to level a city if you dont watch it :-) A manual would be nice or someplace to lookup learned gestures. If you havent played for a while you have no way of looking them up. Thats why I gave only 4 stars. There are still some features that would be useful.","Aug 28, 2018 at 1:52 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:47:54.738742,Lemmingski,I want this to be better,"The control system is the main weakness, but the concept is so gnarly I really want the devs to be encouraged to explore different options and increase the polish.  Please stay the course.  Take heart that you are blowing at least SOME minds with this game.  A certain title currently in beta which I totally won't violate the NDA regarding might hold some inspiration regarding movement in zero gravity.

Oh, and over time, some more real world landmarks and iconic cities would be awesome, but not as high a priority as the above.","Aug 19, 2018 at 7:46 PM",4, 6,

I play a lot of VR, and  the flying in this game is some of the most fun I've had with the headset. It takes getting used to, and apparently you have to turn off all the ""enhancements"" in options, so I didn't have the blur issue. At first i thought the gaze-aim would suck, but in a game where you want the most precision, it was a good idea. I recommend that you give this game a try and refund it if it's not for you. I love it though","Aug 14, 2018 at 10:02 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:47:54.785617,Domitjen,"4 stars, but could easily become 5 if","This just continues to get updated and be worked on, honestly this game has so much potential, If u wanna feel like a god, this is it.

However, visually seems to be a port and is lacking in resolution/clarity sometimes, and no idea if it's because I am using touch controllers or not but the energy blast shooting thing out of my hand doesn't always work because of the gesture we need to make while doing it, one dedicated button or better sensitivity would be better.

2022-05-28 18:47:57.869369,RuneSR2,The blurriest textures on the Rift?,"Extremely blurry game, this game does not respond to Oculus Tray Tool (OTT) at all, thus I can't enable super-sampling (OTT is on, it just doesn't do anything - I've never experienced that before) - and if there's one thing these mega-ton-blurry textures need it's super-sampling. I activated the Oculus Tray Tool HUD for Pixel Density and got - nothing - no value is registered in the HUD. Disabling OTT did nothing either. So this game is special and overrides usual Rift settings. AA and anything with ""SSAO MB"" resulted in mega-mega-blurry (but antialiased!) textures - simply horribly to look at, like someone dripped liquid butter in my eyes ;-) So do yourself a favor - get the best and most crisp textures by completely disabling AA (and worse) in the menu. I maxed out the other (tesselation) settings with no problem. Using 1080, 7700k, 16GB. 
Frame rate was great - then again game looks like it's using a super-sampling value of 0.5... It was fun to fly around and this game is based on an awesome idea - but I simply can't - and won't - accept such mega-extremely mega-poor textures. This game in no way represents the awesome quality the Rift is known for, it feels like a badly ported game from the PS4. I will have to refund this game, sorry.","Aug 10, 2018 at 4:46 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 18:47:57.885326,Dagre89,Space Invaders on Steroids,"Not a bad game over all.  I've spent about 2 to 3 hours playing so far.  Basically protect the humans and world cities from waves of Space Invaders.  Definitely an arcade game with a twist.  Different enemy ships offer different challenges. Gain more powers with each round completed.  The game runs suprisingly smooth however the graphics are average.  Relieve some stress by killing the humans and destroying cities yourself.  The only thing I would have liked to of seen was an option for infinite life.  If you use the giga-nuke weapon thingy, it'd be nice to have a few more seconds of enjoyment, watching the entire city collapse before the level resets.  It was actually well thought and enjoyable to watch. Sometimes i'd just prefer to deviate from the game and just destroy things without the casualty meter being affected.  DEVS.... Any chance of adding an infinite life option for a future update?","Sep 1, 2018 at 10:29 AM",4, 4,

There is zero incentive to move my arms at all, and as a result, the character feels detached. 

Also, up the resolution for pc version. keep the original settings for people with lower end computers.

The concept in itself is not bad! Being able to fly anywhere in the universe is quite cool! No other game has done it this good. But that is about it. The combat is ok. Tha graphics are somewhat tolerable (if you turn AA off!)... but the game itself lacks style! The menus, the text, the ui... it looks like it was made by someone without any knowledge in design!

However, there are some major issues with the game which takes the fun out of it a little. First of all the graphics are a little blurry, it doesn't bug me that much, it just makes it so that you cannot play for long periods of time.
Secondly, for some reason there is a black border in my peripheral vison that will not go away. My computer runs VR fine, and I can't find any settings in-game to fix this issue. This is one of the biggest problems in my opinion. It might be because it was imported from PSVR, but this i feel needs to patched ASAP.

My Thoughts:
I have been looking forward to the VR version of this game for a while now and I believe it's been worth the wait. The feeling of being a superhero like Superman in this game is amazing. I was also blown away by the amazing sense of scale and depth on offer.... even the aliens were diverse and fun to hunt down and destroy.

The gameplay is hectic, action packed and full of twists and turns. The graphics do look a little bit blurry but I think that's down to the art style and not the game itself.

A few people are having problems and issues on the Steam forums, but I had no problems running or starting the game with the Oculus Rift. I must admit I did feel a little bit queasy after turning all the safety options off during my initial gameplay, so if you have a weak stomach I would recommend you leave the safety features on.

All in all I had a blast with this and cannot wait to jump back in again and save civilization as we know it.","Aug 10, 2018 at 5:52 AM",5, 10,
