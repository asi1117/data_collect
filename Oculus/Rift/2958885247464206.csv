The tutorial is in what feels like a small area, with a video panel on the wall that displays images, or instruction.   So you have to hit the colored balls with the colored stik in your hand.  Each and every hit sounds like 2 little finger cymbols are being hit.  Tsss tsss tsss tsss.  Very annoying.   

Moving from the tutorial there was solo, and campaign mode so I tried solo first.
I found a song that sounded like what I might like and went to it 
Its was like I was back into tutorial in the same small room.   Some lighting effects did take place in one of the levels, but overall the lack of actual unique levels or an atmosphere started to give the impression the game was slopped together.  

At this point I am seeing its like beat saber and synth rider and it takes those elements together, and doesnt do either of them justice and is a cheap copycat.

I exit to the menu where now I see the forefround and notice that it also lacks any  sign of effort being put into it.  Its a very basic mountan/terrain with a little dept that scrolls behind the menu.

I go to campain and its not a story at all, each level has 3 requireents to get all 3 diamonds for that level.  Then it takes those diamonds and unlocks the next songs when you have enough.  The songs were mostly chinese, with the exception of one song they were not that great..That combined with the cymbol clashing every orb I hit I got my fill of this game really fast   

Bottom line is it seems like its trying to ride the coat tails of beat saber and failed to provide any unique twists or put any actual creative energy into the game.   It is a generic and lacks flavor.","Mar 14, 2020 at 12:12 PM",2, 6,

I tried the campaign mode and found that there are different ""weapons"" available (mace, racket etc.), when you must use boxing gloves to complete a game stage, you will find that the difficulty of the game has increased a lot, sometimes you even have to move your feet to chase the balls.","Mar 10, 2020 at 6:07 PM",5, 6,

More freedom than Beat Saber. You can touch the rhythm ball at will and even stab it. Although some levels are not perfect, I experienced a different possibility of genre.","Mar 14, 2020 at 4:22 PM",5, 4,
