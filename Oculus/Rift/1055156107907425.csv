My two favourite things! But I've just found myself confused and frustrated. After about a minute the music stops, and the levels just... stop. There's no game over, no 'end' to them, and no indication if that's it or not. You're left just standing there trying to shoot things in a dead and silent level. There are no tutorials, and moving by shooting arrows at markers - while a completely fine mechanic - to get close enough to the instructions board in the main room seems rather cruel. ""To learn to play this game you must already know how to play this game."" If this game stayed with you all the way I'd love it, but the way everything just stops and leaves you feeling like you've broken it feels unfriendly. This is the kind of game that only works if the player feels welcomed, and I certainly didn't.","Sep 24, 2018 at 12:13 AM",3, 14,
2022-05-28 18:24:18.392934,borgiamas,Still needs work,Very buggy while playing. The tablet to navigate flickers too much. Games like wack a mole minigame during the newspaper delivery was terrible. As soon as I would hit a mole I couldn't see anything until the points disappeared. Same with the log splitting. The pizza game was weird because the chef would be in front of the target 90 percent of the time and couldn't actually hit the target. I can understand that being part of the challenge but not the entire time?,"Dec 23, 2017 at 7:28 AM",2, 7,
