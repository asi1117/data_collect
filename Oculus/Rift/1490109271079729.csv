2022-05-28 14:05:35.727200,alice.vexed,I'll give it five stars when...,"I can finish it. Every time I pick up the watch I teleport to the washing station, pick up the brush, and the watch is transported back to the original bin. Every. Single. Time. I've restarted several times and I get the same thing. After a while the brush starts to just dissappear too. I ran into a few other similar issues and would always have to restart the game and use the level select feature to get back. Also I find myself having to scoot myself backwards not to block the controls or what's in front of me until I have to restart the whole thing because my guardian lines keep warning me that I am about to move out of the limit. This is a great idea and the entire experience really is worth the 5 stars but the functionality is what keeps me from giving it the full rating.",Jan 31 at 12:13 PM,4, 17,
2022-05-28 14:05:35.741163,Pickletoaster289,"Pretty good, down side","Overall, I can tell that this game has been made amazing. The down side that I am having is that it would not let me play the story where you see the people and ship sinking. I would load the first few sentences of the experiance and then cut out. The whole point of me buying this game was to play and see the ship sink. really not happy with that.","Feb 21, 2021 at 2:54 AM",4, 48,
2022-05-28 14:05:35.757120,Reese1975,One of dreams has finally come true.,I have been fascinated by the Titanic story since I was a kid and it was announced that the ship was finally found in 1985. I have seen every documentary about the ship and have always dreamed of going down to explore the wreck. Now thanks to VR my dream has come true at least to some extent. I was stunned by the work that was done on this. So far my experiences with VR have been amazing but this was another level. I hope that some day this gets remastered in 8k. Truly a life changing experience.,"May 18, 2020 at 2:47 AM",5, 58,
2022-05-28 14:05:35.772080,Morpheus175,Nice VR experience,"Well - the sinking scene is not interactive and can only be witnessed. Real fun is to explore the wreck, but no matter if you play the story or explore it yourself in sandbox mode. The wreck is modeled quite detailed and you get a good impression of what the Titanic wreck looked like between 2000 and 2010. The only thing I miss in this game, that really would have been a perfect bonus, is an explorable model of the Titanic as it was before the sinking. This unfortunately can't be found in this game, but however - it is a great, interesting VR experience.","Apr 13, 2020 at 3:29 AM",4, 48,

If I try to use my left ocoulus stick it can only move slightly to left and right. The only way I can move forward is to grab the VR stick and pull my hand forward, but as soon as I let that go it goes back to the middle for a sec and then straight back into reverse. Ive unplugged my gamepad, taken out the batteries for the oculus controllers, restarted the computer, nothing works. This also means that when I put on my helmet to control the drone, it cant move forward because I dont have a virtual stick to grab.","Mar 7, 2020 at 9:09 PM",2, 15,

2022-05-28 14:05:38.933752,auburn866,A Must Play for Titanic Fans,"This game is fantastic.  One of the most fun VR experiences I have had so far.  The ""story"" experience is nice as it takes you on a sort of guided tour throughout the wreckage to see many of the key places on the ship.  They also throw in some interesting facts and real audio clips from some of the survivors, really pulls you in.  It is also fun to explore the wreckage in sandbox mode.  The sinking experience is very well done and emotional.  This is a short experience, and yet the perfect length.  However, I really wish you could explore the ship before she sank, I honestly would have paid more if that was part of the game.","Dec 28, 2019 at 2:58 PM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 14:05:38.949709,nnsense,Incredible,"How I would like more games like this. The Titanic is there, right after you, it's so immersive, so real. Controls are fantastic, you can explore inside the Titanic with a small robot and its surrounding with your ship. There's an automated tour (2 actually, a shorter and a longer one). I don't know how much you can actually dive into the Titanic, if the simulation shows just the exterior because I didn't played enough but so far I would buy it again 1000 times.","Dec 28, 2019 at 9:01 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 14:05:38.964669,cybernettr,Wish there were more guidance,"It’s ironic to think that the Titanic, had she not sunk but had lived out her normal lifespan would have, In obsolescence, been sent to the scrapyards years ago and would no longer exist. But because of this tragedy, she remains over 100 years later on the ocean floor as a monument to herself and the hundreds of people who lost their lives with her. The re-creation of the sinking was very well done although, in real life, I imagine there was much more of an emotional outburst than depicted in this experience.  I suppose if they showed the true horror and anguish of the real life event it would have been even more depressing than it already is. I wish there were a little more help and guidance in the undersea experience because it is hard to figure out where I am supposed to go.","May 30, 2019 at 6:31 AM",4, 17,

BUT when we are looking through the passengers point of view it is very buggy and hard to look around. Everytime you turn your head it glitches a bit but everything else is normal with no issue.

It is unbelivably well made and SOO immersive to explore the wreck. And the guided tour is amazing. If you have just the slightest interest in the Titanic story this is an absolute MUST..

Its worth it just to see this experience in VR.  Not crazy about the game play, but so far I've made it to the bow and placed the plaque.  Will go back in to see if any more tours, but not sure if I'm up to the game play to complete the different objectives.

2022-05-28 14:05:42.130298,MAJ161.RED,,"This is worthy of 5 stars and is certainly something I will show off to friends and family.
However, there is one problem that needs fixing. I couldn't find any way to pause the game. I was viewing the long tour of the submerged ship.  My headset was getting heavy and uncomfortable. and I wanted to pause the tour to take the headset off and have a break.
I couldn't see a way of doing that, so I took the headset off anyway. When I put it back on a minute later, the game had gone back to the main menu and I had to start the tour again. 
When you press the menu button, you get a menu choice to exit or not exit, but this doesn't pause the game. It just carries on behind the menu.
If there is a way to pause the game that I've missed, please let me know!
It would be useful if you could also exit the tour half way through and continue later. It's a long tour and some people won't find it a comfortable experience to wear a headset for so long.","Aug 24, 2018 at 7:19 AM",5, 49,

Sure, it would've been nice to walk around the actual ship...maybe see the grand staircase...stand on the front bow and pretend to fly, but hey: how much can you demand for twenty bucks?

If I had to complain about one thing, it's that we always pick up objects by pinching (trigger), never by actually grabbing (grab button), which would have felt more natural for the larger objects.","Dec 18, 2018 at 3:27 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 14:05:45.302878,Bel-garath,Was expecting more after Apollo 11,"I'm sorry as I know there was a lot of work put into this, but all I can say is that I loved Apollo 11 from start to finish because you felt like you were experiencing something that wouldn't be possible before VR. I felt like during that like someone who was a part of history and it brought tears to my eyes. This experience was quite frankly boring. I would have preferred the entire experience be focused on the events on the boat before and during the sinking. I appreciated the perspective of the lifeboat, but I wanted more of that same perspective on the boat itself. I really didn't want the focus to be like a museum after the sinking. It didn't give me that same sense of being a part of history. It was very educational and if you prefer the history after the sinking, then this is more like 4+ star experience.","Sep 10, 2018 at 5:27 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 14:05:45.318344,nrosko,,"Was dissapointed that the exerience is quite limited. You can't just go anywher you want in the sub, you can't explore the boat before it sank. The parts in the lab just feel like filler. Textures where quite low quality. I didn't think it was worth the money although it wasn't bad.","Aug 31, 2018 at 11:25 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 14:05:48.413174,webnerd,Excellent demonstration of VR,"This is a great experience and an amazing demonstration of what VR can be used for. This comes in two parts, a 'game' and a few experiences - I say 'game' because that mainly consists of a series of 'go here ... do this' missions. While the game part is good and gives you a really good experience of what controlling a submersible and ROV would be like, it did seem a little samey towards the end (not a flaw, it is what it is).

I encountered a few bugs in the game part, which whilst not complete deal breakers were a little annoying (my suitcase vanished on me in the lab, and my other items somehow ended back in the white water tray in the first mission). At times, the audio dialog overlapped while being in the submersible - if you moved too quick, that seems to be where it happened.

For me, the best part of this was the experiences, the lifeboat experience was extremely well-executed and provides a really poignant and saddening viewpoint on the sinking of the ship. The wreck tours are likewise great (a short and long version are available) and the commentary is good.

A want would be the ability to turn off the lights in the submersible (or to not have the submersible interior as a preference) while in the tours/sandbox - I would love to have the full visuals available rather than peering through a small porthole. 

Overall, this is a 5/5 - I got 5hrs out of this (and likely more with the sandbox mode) and the few bugs I encountered do not detract from the experience and I'm sure they're relatively easy to fix too. Well done for providing such a great experience!!","Aug 26, 2018 at 9:01 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:05:48.429131,Chris2033,Top title,"I had finished the pre release section and now have seen the experiance. First the experiance. Pretty depressing as you would expect. Short, but any longer would have been unnecissary. Well directed and acted with plenty going on all the time to keep the 'player' inmterested. Most intresting was the scale of the ship. Being in the water next to such a big ship gives a different perspective. Overall good work I would give 5 stars to. I had an issue with vertical lines, about 15 thin grey lines, over the whole image during the scene. I could not find anything on google about this. The diving section which I have completed half of was varied and with enough depth of story etc to be well worth a look in my opinion. It had the same feel as Lone Echo for me as a single player game with exploration and progressing just slower and less exiting. Some may not get into it easily but the first half was not too long or repetivive and had some good bits. I look forward to the second half. Anyone had the grey(ish) lines?","Sep 5, 2018 at 9:54 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 14:05:48.444091,Kevin_Brook,Outstanding educational tours,"I purchased this in early access several months ago but never got in to it as all I really wanted was the educational tours, and not game mechanics. Well the tours released on the 16th August and they are exceptional. The sinking experience was  harrowing and the long wreck tour must have been over 30 minutes long, and was fascinating and moving in equal measure. For me, its experiences like this that really justify the purchase of a Virtual reality headset, it's a uniquely immersive way to learn. The commentary was very well done, delicately handled with sensitivity. I will have to watch again as it was such a sensory overload the first time I couldn't take it all in. I hope this sells well as educational pieces like this deserve to be seen and experienced by as many people as possible. Seeing it like this brings it home in a way reading, or watching a flat screen video just can't do. The same team previously made Apollo 11 VR, which is just as awe inspiring. Both are capable of bringing you to tears, although for very different reasons.","Aug 18, 2018 at 7:23 AM",5, 11,

So, hats off to the developers! No, I didn't finish it. No, I cannot give a fair crtiique to the entire program, but that makes my review no less important than others. I have an irrational fear and Titanic VR replicates the object of that fear quite aptly. I'll keep trying in increments.

2022-05-28 14:05:57.917076,paulohotline,TitanicVR is glorious in early beta!,"I am really digging this teaching simulation. Driving around in the mini robot is awesome and exciting. I had to hold my breath when I first descended into the Grand Staircase into the black abyss, it was an extremely immersive experience. 
I wish we had at least one 1912 Titanic experience with this early release to view/participate but I am ok with waiting until 2018 if the quality is this good. 
BTW, the integration of the Titanic survivor interviews when approaching certain sections of the ship is amazing and adds a ton of gravitas to the simulation, Well done!

A couple of requests from the devs if this is not already on their whiteboard:

a) Can we have the option to clean the items and skip right to the final cleaned finished object? After I have done this a couple of times I am ok with skipping it and going right to the reveal.

b) Can we be allowed to pickup any objects found in our searches and store it a locker? I cannot grab tea cups, dishes etc to inspect closer. Would love to be able to grab anything inside and out the Titanic.

Another suggestion I have that for me would be amazing would be to allow us to ""activate 1912 flashback"" when traveling in a specific part of the ship similar to what James Cameron did in the movie. In VR that would be spectacular!

Theres a major bug for me in that using two sticks at once in the submersible resets my position in VR which is really jarring. Also I found the scale when ""playing"" as the ROV is off, everything seems too small. The doors inside the wreck for example.
Also as others have said, some of the grabbing and selecting mechanics are very confusing. I spent ages trying to work out how to place the plaque , thinking I had to grab the flashing blue area. 
Also framerate was pretty bad even on medium detail and I'm on a Rx580.
I'm sure this will only get better though and it's already a very immersive adventure!","Dec 3, 2017 at 7:35 PM",3, 3,Using the sticks together should not reset your position. If you are holding the grip buttons and triggers together this will reset your view. Try just using the sticks on your touch controllers without grabbing the in game sticks and see if that works any better for you.
2022-05-28 14:06:01.116650,DogTailRed2,Supporting an interesting VR experience,"I purchased this straight away as I want to encourage further development and believe that a Titanic experience is one of the things we need for VR.
I've played the first two `tasks` or `missions` if you like. The underwater scene is well done. I like the submersible and ROV but like others have said the scale is a little off for the ROV but I can live with that. I was a little dissapointed that the ROV could not take the plaque from the submersibles front baskets (as I would imagine would happen in real life). Finding the plaque as an inventory item was a little dissapointing but again not a big issue.
I like the feeling of impending doom when exploring the wreck and I feel a little scared when `being` the ROV. I feel relieved to be back in the sub. So the immersion aspect is working.
There is a very annoying bug when cleaning items with the scrubbing brush. Sometimes, well quite often, the brush hits a sweat spot and all the discoveries return to the water bath. Even those in the cabinet. It's very annoying. Hope that can be fixed.
Overall I like this experience and think it's worth the price but I think you have to be someone who likes this sort of thing.","Dec 7, 2017 at 2:46 AM",4, 9,
