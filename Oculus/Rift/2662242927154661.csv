2022-05-28 20:44:13.660617,Satconcook,Not even a good tutorial..,"I guess if you can memorize the directions once you get out of VR you could do it, but since you don’t actually do the folding, you just click numbers, it feels like it has no purpose. I think paper directions are easier to follow since you can do it with paper in hand while this just does everything for you. Maybe if this is a precursor to an augmented reality version it has potential. But, you can’t even play with the creations when done.","May 21, 2020 at 12:56 PM",2, 1,

My Initial Thoughts:
Not being able to fold the paper to create the Origami experiences makes this a pointless title. I mean seriously why even bother? I might as well just watch a YouTube video or read a manual.","Feb 10, 2020 at 11:53 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:44:13.689539,Dav.Enca,No interaction with the paper itself,"You simply clic buttons to validate states and watch the animation.
Would be better to directly manipulate the paper, or at least touch precise parts of it to launch guided movements","Feb 10, 2020 at 9:20 PM",3, 4,
