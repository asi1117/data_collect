2022-05-28 19:37:20.889612,DOC-5150,WTH is this?,"This should've been labeled as a midget simulator. I felt like Bilbo Baggins staring at a light switch the size of my face. 
When I think VR I think of hip, techie, bright lights, new age, etc. When they made this I have no idea who their target audience they were aiming for because there are a couple large houses that didn't have a TV and the decor was from a Norman Rockwell painting. If they were aiming for 60-90 year olds you lost them because there are some spots where you think you're going to teleport to another part of the room only to get dragged through a wall like the movie Ghost to be put outside. 

Rename this Paranormal Hobbit Paradox Sleep Aid and it might get better results.","Jul 6, 2018 at 3:17 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:37:24.005860,v2020,Scale,"Houses, offices - scale is important. If you get it right, VR visit will be almost like being there. Otherwise it's just a baby step towards that goal. 

Nevertheless this is already surprisingly enjoyable so 3 stars as motivation to get where this should be (including depth).","Nov 17, 2017 at 8:07 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:37:24.021817,WKGB_Prewitt,"Pretty good, but not fantastic.","Feels like I'm in a bubble of a planetarium looking at flat picture.  It definitly beats looking at flat pictures, but not by much.  Once SLAM technology becomes more prevalent, these houses will be 3D mapped and modeled through quick, passing scans.  But until then, this is about as good as you'll get next to visiting the place or seeing it via video.","May 8, 2017 at 8:20 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:37:24.037775,neuro27,Impressive Real Estate,"Although this app has stiff competition from the other VR app ""Transported,"" it is able to set itself apart. There are 3 ways to explore each home listing: selecting circles to teleport, floorplan, and rooms. Unfortunately, the teleportation is difficult to navigate as you never know where you'll end up and sometimes it even takes you backwards when it should be taking you forwards. The limited home listings (~20 homes and offices) is good enough to show the potential for this app. Without a wider selection, it is merely for artistic purposes at this time.","Mar 19, 2017 at 7:30 AM",4, 3,
