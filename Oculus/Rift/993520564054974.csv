2022-05-28 14:50:25.031507,Notorious_FB,Version 1.0 - no updates,"It says clearly it's an early access version and updates will be available when the game is complete... but as many people wrote before, it seems like the oculus version was abandoned while you get a better version on steam. I regret buying this :(",Jan 11 at 1:13 PM,1, 50,
2022-05-28 14:50:25.046467,DarkWarrior860,Great Game.,"I can see why many left a 1 star review, complaining about V1.0 or funky controls, but this game is really fun. When you start the game, certain default controls are set to your computer's keyboard, so you kinda have to multi-task. I found you can tweak with the settings and change up the controls, so that problem is fixed. People reported bugs as well, but I don't find it too much worse than the xbox version. The only time I don't want to play this game is because I'm scared of the leviathans or my neck is about to snap.",Jul 18 at 10:00 AM,5, 44,
