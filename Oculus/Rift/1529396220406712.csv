It's one thing to lose due to one's own poor ability, it's another when the game will not follow motions.  It's a shooted and the guns do not move with the shooter.  Dual Weild special is unlimted ammo and auto fire for a short period:  The guns literally stay where they are when it's activated making it impossible to aim.  

Broken and dumb.  Like, a nitpick, but why do I have to turn around to start the game?  I face the same direction I do for every other game, but in this one, I have to literally turn around to interact with the missions menu.","Sep 7, 2019 at 11:03 PM",1, 0,

It's not one of the best, but it is a deal when it drops in price that much. If you lower your expecations, it should be $2 fun at least.","Mar 5, 2018 at 6:53 AM",4, 10,
