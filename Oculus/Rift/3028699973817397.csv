Tip - use the gauge to change the sliders, then you'll start to see the fractals form!

My only ask is the ability to turn via controller rather than physically having to. You can get caught in your cabless (rift-s) if you like to roam around your lab like I do!","Feb 27, 2021 at 8:57 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:32:29.356318,Borenberg,Mathematical psychedelic art in VR,"Absolutlely stunning !  That such art is created by mathematical formulas , by nature, blows one's mind. To slowly travel inside and through these creations,  in 3D VR space is a mind boggling experience! The interface is excellent, but I agree with a fellow reviewer that a snap turn option when moving around would be greatly appreciated. This is best played while sitting back in a big reclining chair with your feet up, so please add snap turning.  Other than that minor complaint, this is a masterpiece!","Jun 4, 2021 at 9:40 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:32:29.371278,Clickingtoenails,This is amazing for Fractal Enthusiasts!,"Also thank you to the Devs who continue to patch the software and support it! 
I LOVE this! I am not the most successful at creating my own Fractals. I usually have to start with a recipe and change it up. I so enjoy exploring these worlds!","Oct 24, 2020 at 11:18 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:32:29.389230,Artist3d,A completely new genre of VR creativity!,"As a fellow developer of VR content, I am thrilled that Fractal Alchemist finally made it through Oculus's grueling submission process and is now available in the Oculus Store. Having been a beta tester for many months this official release is consequently, a slick, tightly optimized, Fractal program that will blow minds in the 360 Fractal community! Finally, we can create and explore these amazingly surreal environments from the inside out, to the outside in anddive  deep into the depths of what seems to be the ultimate 'fractallucination'. As an artist/musician developing 360 VR videos and worlds, I find this program an incredible tool for creating and saving full, 3D-360 panospheres at up to 16K. these make stunning Skyboxes for use as other-worldly stage sets useful for performance art and worlds within worlds. People who just love fractals and want to get right to the creative process, without a math degree, will find this a dream interface, totally fun and intuitive to use. It may sound trite but here, San Base presents fractal code as simple building blocks where you construct fractals as easily as well, playing with blocks like a kid! The 'laboratory' environment gives the whole experience a serious feel like you really are an alchemist conjuring up unique formulations. Teh reality is you are! - I love this program and cannot recommend it highly enough, just buy it and discover how remarkably original VR virtual reality content can be!","Jul 26, 2020 at 11:02 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:32:29.403192,coppermine,,"Fantastic program. The 16k photos are truly stunning, they are automatically saved in the photo book when you snap the image, and you can view, adjust and dive into the saved world in fantastic detail.  Music is okay, but I Would love a button on the option menu of loading in your own piece of music from the computer. 

If you love, or have any interest in the fractal universe, get this program.  Extremely good.  There is a good tutorial from the creator on YT, to get you up and running.  Dev, keep with this, Fractals and VR go together like Cheese & Wine.","Jul 26, 2020 at 8:41 AM",4, 3,
