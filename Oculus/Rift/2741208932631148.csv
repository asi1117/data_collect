2022-05-28 20:41:32.282246,AegisVll,Absolutely amazing,I had initially played this game cause I thought it was going to be a mecha-fighting game of sorts. But it turned out to be so much better than that! Every moment of this game is an unforgetable experience. Each and every ending in this game was something amazing to behold. I could play this game over and would still be blown away by the story. I truly cannot begin to express how great of an experience this was to be a part of! My only hope now is for there to be a second game! Or even have anime based on the game!,"Mar 3, 2021 at 3:07 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:41:32.297206,BigHawg,"Too much talking, not enough action",Sorry but I wish i could get a refund on this. 30 mins of talking then a VERY automated/guided battle in a mech. You dont control anything in battle so it doesnt have the feel that you are actually doing anything really. I dont know if I am missing something here but I dont see how this is supposed to be a 5 star game.,"Mar 28, 2021 at 2:47 AM",1, 1,"Thank you so much for playing this game! Actually this game has about 20 hours gameplay.
You can reach the true ending by advancing the game on the second and third laps or more. There is multi-ending and you can not reach the truth on a first play through. We hope you will play the second and third laps or more and will enjoy this game.
In order to unlock the new path, you have to follow the Dieter's advice.
When Meteora shoots the Thornwave, the mirror generator is activated. The important thing here is that the first is to touch all the panels to make it successful, and the second panel will have a noise running in the middle. If you keep reaching for the noise in the middle, the analysis work will be completed. To explain it again, ""Please make the first panel successful, and there is noise running in the middle part of the second panel. Keep reaching for the noise part of the second panel."" This will release the new branch. We hope you will enjoy this game till the very end!"

Hope it can be fixed soon by developer. 
(Update: it had been fixed, incredible!)

For Chinese User/给中文玩家：
需要在“Windows 10设置”-“时间和语言”-“语言”-“首选语言”中添加“English (United States)”、下载语言包，并设定为Windows显示语言，才可以正常运行游戏。

2022-05-28 20:41:32.326128,NikusMM,Amazing. (Language can be changed!),"So far amazing.  The story is very good and the character design is superb (It's by LAM so....yeah.). Played for an hour with the english dub before knowing it could be changed to japanese. The dub detracts from the experience in my opinion, but if you like it, you have the option. Having played Tokyo Chronos I must say that Altdeus improves the VN formula implemented there. This game plays more like an anime episode. It's less static. I hope that in the future we get more VR Visual novels like this one, perhaps more animated sequences and even less static. The potential is there.","Dec 11, 2020 at 9:25 AM",5, 11,
