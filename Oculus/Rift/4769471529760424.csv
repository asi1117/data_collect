2022-05-28 20:02:29.023444,ToT,Missed opportunity,While obviously skilfully created in 3D this app only shows a collection of prerendered 360 degree still images and not a realtime rendered animated 3D environment as I expected. Hopefully in the future the team will consider an actual VR experience because the idea of reconstructing ancient sites in Virtual Reality is fascinating.,"Jan 24, 2021 at 7:01 PM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 20:02:29.039401,slim_sheady19,Why is it 360 photos?,"As another review noted the app is just a series of 360 photos with a handful of videos.  Question for developers: why did you take the time to model and texture this beautiful archaeological site and then not allow users to experience it in real time?  In other words why not let us move around on our own and feel like we are there?  The 360 photos are completely static, the people inside are simply frozen mid-movement and it breaks the sense of presence.  Seems like a bit of a waste?  Just strange since the promotional video was captured in 3-D.
Apart from that, this app takes a very scholarly approach at informing you about this incredible archaeological site.  The descriptions and interpretations of the meaning behind the sculptures are especially fascinating.","Feb 2, 2021 at 9:28 AM",3, 6,
