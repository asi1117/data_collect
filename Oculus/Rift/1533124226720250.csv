2022-05-28 16:56:11.782207,DankKat,Could this be the future of music videos,"I wasn't expecting much, but for 99 cents I thought I'd give this a shot. I was pleasently surprized. I think it would be great if all bands would release music videos this way.","Apr 10, 2021 at 6:37 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:56:11.796170,or_perel12,How much does the sofa cost?,Hey ive noticed that the jumpscaring guy has a rather large nose. is that antisemic? would recommend a friend,"Aug 19, 2020 at 9:11 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:11.810133,Nihility83,Fun!,I loved it.,"Apr 10, 2019 at 10:04 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:11.825093,HilariousDolphin,Well done!,"The experience is creepy, not the scariest thing ever but had hairs standing up quite a bit, good times!","Jun 7, 2018 at 3:11 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:56:11.840053,DisplayVRC,Singalong,"Great song, Great graphics , spooky rock experience , even my wife liked it and she dont like Vr that much.","Mar 11, 2018 at 1:36 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:56:14.991624,nightcat.mau,Five Star Fright Fest!,"One, it's a really good music video, really has a feel of 80s pop/punk funsion, heavier on the punk. Two, the floor show of objects flying at you and other suprises I won't spoil is top notch. I've played games where the frights were laughable, but this actually got scary since I did not expect the thrill ride it takes you on. Does contain flashing lights and jump scares, so please keep that in mind.","Dec 17, 2017 at 8:04 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:56:15.006584,Valver,A great way to get exposure!,"The song's not really my cup of tea, but I enjoyed the experience.  And the spooky stuff happening as you watch the TV made it quite memorable - having new music in VR is a better than a Youtube video alone that's for sure.  Well worth your time downloading and checking  out.  Thanks!","Dec 20, 2017 at 5:29 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:56:15.020546,jontheepi,Music Video in VR,"Fun! Shows a lot of potential for music videos in VR. Music can be a full sensory experience.  Other music VR experiences tend to be more about graphics. This one had a good balance of music and graphics. For example, you see the band playing its instruments.","Dec 30, 2017 at 10:58 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:56:15.038499,Apolysus,No feeling of dept,"An interesting demo and a good song. It evolves to more than you'd expect. Sadly the scale doesn't translate well, there is no dept in the expanded enviornment","Jan 17, 2018 at 8:35 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:15.056450,Buster_Bootlace,Good Fun and Great Experience!,"The song wasn't quite for me, but the it was very catchy and I liked it, great way to spread awareness of your track, good for you.

The experience was fun and made me jump a few times, but the scariest part was definately sitting next to a picture of Jimmy Savill!

Good job!","Dec 21, 2017 at 2:41 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:56:18.146186,HeyJesseAe,Great!,"One of the better-done VR music videos. I don't like the song at all, but the experience is pretty good. Spooked me once or twice.","Jan 21, 2018 at 11:07 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:18.161146,ronnyrydgren,Wasnt going tor review it. But...,This is an amazing free experience! Anyone rating this under 4 stars make no sense. its a free experience and a good one. I understand if they paid a lot for it to review it bad but you review after worth. This experience is actually really good. someone wrote about wrong perspective but i didnt notice that. Its a sitting experience so be sure to sit on this one for best experience:),"Dec 15, 2017 at 5:54 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:56:18.176106,Knotterer,Amazing Sound,"Well, once again I am surprised how good the sound of those little oculus earphones is. And yeah, the immersive environment they added for free is really nice. For 5 stars they would have needed to include some more mind-blowing special effects. That's why I stick with a very solid 4 stars.","Dec 18, 2017 at 4:11 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:18.190069,WebKnight,Great Vid,"Surprised at how good it was.  Use to be for sale, but free now so figured why not.  Buying music is not one of my things but was a great free experience.  Will be something nice to demo as well","Dec 29, 2017 at 10:58 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:18.205029,Plurr,Rather poor quality,"I got it for free, but I felt like it should be free. There are better horror or music experiences out there that are free. It has simple graphics, and a series of horror things that happen around you, one after another. Then it's over.","Dec 15, 2017 at 4:31 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:56:21.287783,becklarae,Pretty cool,"Pretty cool, graphics are amazing. probably would not of bought it, but for free, yeah try it out.","Dec 31, 2017 at 1:46 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 16:56:21.316706,ZeusFaber,Top of the Pops dissimilated,This is most excellent.  I think from other reviews mostly from the USA the references are not apparent.  This is very much for a British audience with an appreciation of the content and of a certain age. Best 79p i spent since i bought the Beano and Dandy!,"Nov 4, 2017 at 6:37 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:56:21.331666,CrashFu,,"An accurate simulation of being ****ed with by a poltergeist while trying to watch whatever the british equivalent of MTV is.

But in all seriousness, I LOVE this trend of one-or-two-dollar VR music videos;  Far more entertaining than just buying an MP3.

Oh yeah, and the song is pretty good, too.","Jul 22, 2017 at 10:47 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:56:21.346626,FastLawyer,Don't listen to naysayers,"First of all, this is a British glam rock group music video haunted house ""experience.""  So if you're not British (and I am not), you won't have any idea about the references (including that review about the pedo which is just a picture frame of some weird looking British dude in the sofa next to you, big whoop).  Anyways, the haunted house experience is not scary, but it is fun, kind of reminiscent of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  The music is okay too.  Definitely worth the small purchase price.  Very good visuals and where else can you experience a music video like this?  Please make more, hopefully with better music and more renown music artists.","Jun 20, 2019 at 5:44 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:56:24.468277,metarobbo,Dope VR single,"Strong track by the Indelicates, and the simple but atmospheric VR environment does the job of providing retro-campy  context for the lyrics and the music video itself.","Sep 19, 2017 at 1:44 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:56:24.483237,THE-VR-SHOP,Have some thought FFS!,"It's no secret how much of a fan I am of VR music videos. While the glam rock style beats and spooky music set the tone of the music making it more immersive what I am not a fan of is having an image of a convicted paedophile being thrown at me then having to sit next to it! For heaven's sake and for the sake of all his victims, change the image FFS and have a little thought of what it might do if someone was a victim and tried this app! I get the style and the lyrics, heck I was also a glam rock kid, but there was no need for it. I can only suggest no-one even thinks of buying this app until that issue is updated.","Jun 24, 2017 at 6:00 PM",1, 10,"Hi!

This is a song that is literally about that convicted paedophile, the tainted legacy of popular music and the way that nostalgia fails to take into account the discomforting, haunted nature of the past as it is now revealed to us. As such, quite a lot of thought did go into throwing that paedophile at you, it wasn't done lightly and there was a need for it.
Still, thanks for your feedback. Hopefully your review will act as a trigger warning to anyone who might be upset by it on their own behalf; and I agree that they should steer clear.
All the best."
2022-05-28 16:56:24.498197,introspaced,"Great ""up-yours!"" to the BBC","I liked the song. Anyone who says it is tasteless has not understood the meaning of the song. It will probably only make sense to the British audience. As for the video, I'm not sure what 1970's paedophile rings in the BBC and NHS has to do with Ouija Boards and poltergeists but I enjoyed it anyway!","Jul 29, 2017 at 4:22 AM",4, 1,
