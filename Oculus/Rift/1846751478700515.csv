After a few waves, you are unable to pick up your guns, which means you'll have to operate your Foxholes (traps, basically) or other infantry (like machine guns, moaters, etc.). But this is ALSO a problem itself, because if the enemy gets too far, its over, ESPECIALLY if it's a tank, one tank is enough to destroy your base, and if the door is gone, one enemy gets in and its
GAME OVER.
This is an annoying bug that literally makes the game UNPLAYABLE, due to the fact that you need 50000 points or MORE to unlock the 2nd map, and IDK about anyone else, but the most I've ever got is 30000. Please, FIX THIS BUG! You're losing newcomers because of this!
p.s this game is actually really fun other than this bug
Thank you for your time.",Apr 22 at 7:18 AM,3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:35:10.057049,Redron357,Quest 2 From Rift,"I purchase your app for my Rift, works great.  I replaced my Rift with a new Quest 2. it is mental to think someone is going to repurchase your app for a newer hardware, but same system (Facebook). I refuse to purchase it again due to newer version of the quest 2 I have. I would like my purchase moved to my lol same Facebook account under my quest 2. BTW I had to replace my rift due to Oculus not supporting the purchase of new Headset cables.",Sep 6 at 5:49 AM,1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:35:10.073006,whitewolfv,Good at first,"It looks to be fun and a good game at first but the issue with the gun which been reported many times and developers dont care to fix it. Also it gets almost no fun, since you have to operate everything manually and enemy destroy them as well, game becomes too serious and no fun so i dropped playing it after 1 time play","May 29, 2020 at 2:45 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 19:35:10.090958,Mad_Dog2020,Fun but has a big issue,I enjoyed playing this game on my Rift S but after a few waves I couldn't grab my pistols anymore.It happens during gameplay when I drop them to reload.I can see them but can't grab them.I think the Devs gave up on this game already so I wouldn't buy this game unless they decide to fix this.Not being able to grab your pistols takes all the fun out of this game.It really sucks because it's really fun to play.,"May 18, 2020 at 6:50 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 19:35:13.225183,suzuki11,glitchy,could be a fun game until it wont let you grab your guns then your dead.  got fed up and wont play it anymore,"Apr 11, 2020 at 8:44 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 19:35:13.241140,Ayatoldya_muckhuck,Fun.,"A great game. Needs a better sense of progression and some polish to make it really addictive. As is, there are some endless levels that need a certain score to progress to the next map.  It feels a little unbalanced. The drops seem to slow down. The shooting is really good, needs to progress past the revolver to make the most of it though, the game is screaming out for some big guns and carnage. There is a machine gun 'tower' but its hopeless. It needs something more to keep me coming back, but it does get better the more you put in.  Add global scoreboard too please. As said, sooo much potential. 3 and half stars, could be 5 easily.","Jun 19, 2019 at 1:41 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 19:35:13.257097,Dangus1,GREAT potential.,"I bought this game for 20 dollars, minus my oculus credit, so it really cost me 5 dollars. 5 bucks is what its worth now, but I hope it gets better. 
When you first boot up you get into the tutorial, which was a ton of fun. All the towers and mechanics are awesome, you have a pistol or 2 at your side, and all the defenses are great fun to use. You have automated defenses, like a claymore mine, land mines, a flamethrower station, and a missile launcher. You also have defenses you man yourself, like a machine gun, mortars, and artillery. Those are all great, but the excitement starts to diminish after a while because the game isnt well balanced. All the defences need babysitting, because they all run out of ammo way too fast. Its an awesome idea to reload your stuff, and those mechanics and how you do them are where the fun in this game lies. A good example is the flamethrower. Enemies come at your base slowly, giving you time to shoot them. Awesome, but the flamethrower tower turns on when an enemy is in range, and keeps spewing flames and burning its very small fuel tanks, and if you dont hit the stop button the next enemy in the wave wont make it in range until after it's empty. Then you pay credits for a reload. The same goes for the rocket tower, the defense that requires the least amount of babysitting. You buy rockets, they fly off and kill your target, but the enemies are so spaced out it doesnt do splash damage, at least not in practice. Everything costs credits, too, and I wish reloads were free, conisdering how often you need to do them. 1 enemy kill costs a reload at this time. If the dev's really polish it, this will be the best TD game in VR. Right now it's just OK. I want towers that are as effective as they are fun to use. I really want the developers to stick by this and make it amazing, because it absolutely could be.","Apr 28, 2018 at 3:44 PM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 19:35:13.272057,iatwisted,AMAZING Shooter/Tower Defense Hybrid!!!,Are you a fan of Shooters & Tower Defense games? Well this is an amazing hybrid of the two!!! Not only is it the best hybrid of the two gametypes but individually i believe it's the best (first person) shooter and tower defense game offered today. The fact that it's both combined into one is incredible. This has and will continue to provide hours and hours and hours of fun. Honestly the best money i've spent on the Rift store so far!!! Highly Recommended!!!,"Mar 22, 2018 at 8:45 PM",5, 16,
