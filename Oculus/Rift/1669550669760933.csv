2022-05-28 16:48:27.572802,RScullion,It's OK,"I watched the whole thing in one session. Although in theory you can free roam and explore, all the plot lines join up so there's really no point. In fact I think by free roaming I ruined some of the surprises you were meant to get as the story lines interleaved.
Not really a patch on the Invisible Hours where there was so much going on and you had to jump from character to character just to try to follow it. This is a much more passive (and frankly less imaginative) experience.
Also, I thought the graphics were a bit limited. Certainly not up the quality of something like Lone Echo (or again the Invisible Hours). 
All in all, probably a bit pricey for what it is. About half the price would put it in the same category as a movie and then it would be OK.","Jun 4, 2019 at 4:20 AM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 16:48:27.586764,Zenbane,"Fanastic story, great experience","This little gem adds another great storytelling experience to the VR Library. The features are very similar to ""The Invisible Hours"" which is another title that I love. I enjoyed taking my type to witness every story, and the plot is very well done. Highly recommended. Although the price point may be a bit high for the overall time investment (just over 1 hour). I would suggest waiting for a sale (like I did).","Jun 22, 2019 at 9:22 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:48:27.601724,hydlide,"a unique idea, yet flawed","The thing I like about this concept and idea is that you have a story from 6 different angles. But here's is also part of the problem with it I have with it with its current story.

Just to avoid to many spoilers ahead, there is a thing called an ""arc"". Meaning a character goes from here to there with a specific meaning and purpose. Yet the arc with most of these characters isn't really something that is much surprising and in the end I felt quite depressed while watching all of these endings.

If the story would have been different (eg: there is so much potential when it comes to storywriting in this concept), I might have enjoyed this a bit more. But the problem is with the story line of telling it 'this way', is that a lot of plots are already told when you get to character 3 (for instance). Thus you easily fit all the pieces of the puzzle pretty quick and there are no real 'suprises' at the end.

In the end you just realize that the first story basically told everything you needed to know and the rest of it is just additional 'blah' where you go like, so I just sat there for 66 minutes, to see a story that was told in 11 minutes of time.

An idea that could have twisted the plot line around is that somewhere during the storyline, there were bits and bobs not told during the first few story lines at all. But because all these stories are inner connected (which is also cool, but also flawed at the same time), the whole concept becomes repatitive to say the least.

Another problem I have with this idea, is that it isn't something you have an influence on. Since we are gamers, a cool idea here would have been if we had choices that could have been made. And based on those choices the story would be different (kind of like bandersnatch, but then in VR). Yet we get a linear story telling thing from 6 perspectives and there for it does not gain any re-play value right there. Once the 6 stories are done, you are done. Moving on to the next VR-game.","Jun 16, 2019 at 8:03 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:48:27.616684,ParadiseDecay,The future of Story Telling.,"My Initial Thoughts:
A steller storytelling experience in VR. This is the future of story telling. Fans of 'Invisible Hours' will love this concept.

2022-05-28 16:48:27.631644,ImTylerDurden,Weak Ending to a Novel Experience,"While I found the individual plot lines interesting, I genuinely thought they would come together in a more profound ending than the mediocre 2 minute epilogue that we receive which is more or less just a quick 15-20 second conclusion to each character’s story that you could have already guessed at given where their 11 minute stories ended. 

I was left feeling letdown as if there was more to the story that they either held back for a sequel or didn’t have enough time to add into this story. 

The experience overall was still good and it grips you from the beginning. I also enjoyed having free control over where to go and what to see, but I wish the world was more alive. Other than the main characters, there isn’t much else going on. 

For example, there is a minor subplot with an abandoned baby. I used the rewind feature to backtrack all the way to the beginning of the story only to find the baby was always there alone in the streets. Who brought it there? Why did they leave it there? These are the types of loose ends that I thought this form of storytelling would allow me to discover. 

Overall, I had much higher expectations for this story than what was delivered. And while the brief 1 hour or so ride was still enjoyable, it left a lot to be desired. I’m interested to check out other experiences like this because it’s a neat idea, but the execution on this one was ok at best.","Jun 3, 2019 at 1:38 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 16:48:30.743322,tommosaur,Fascinating way of experiencing a story,"A unique way to experience a movie and another good reminder what makes VR special, things like this one can only experience like this in VR.
It is like watching the last 11 minutes and eleven seconds of a planet from the perspective of a few different characters. And one can choose which character to follow/focus on, but one can also zoom in and out and walk and teleport around. So by watching it from the different perspectives and following the different characters/sub plots, one stepwise gets the entire picture. I felt like it was quite a cool way to experience a storyline and doing so while being able to move around in VR somehow makes one get a much better sense of the locations and more of a connection with the different characters. 
It gives one a mixture of a feeling of a detective bringing together different threads and a movie director in a way.","May 28, 2019 at 9:05 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:48:30.758281,Falcon_DS_,Hopefully we will see more like this,"The future of story-telling for sure.  Much like 'The Invisible Hours', the more you watch, the further this seemingly short 11 minute tale unravels into an intricately woven narrative.  I can only imagine how a feature length story would play out.  Imagine a single Game of Thrones episode viewed from all these perspectives; it would be awe inspiring.","May 26, 2019 at 10:47 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:48:30.772244,crowley098,Excellent Concept!,"Inside this 11 minute movie, there is a fully realised world that I found fascinating.
I've only watched two of the six storylines, and how they all intersect and flesh each other out is incredibly well done.
The voice acting (and sound in general) is excellent, and after you watch the first story line they unlock the ability to explore, fast forward, rewind and switch characters at your leisure.
I cannot wait to finish it and then explore the small details that are hidden from the main story lines","May 24, 2019 at 10:06 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 16:48:30.802164,neil.nathanson,Well done!,"Cool and interesting idea with 6 storylines that intersect during the same 11 minute event so easily over an hour of viewing.
