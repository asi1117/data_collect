2022-05-28 19:04:13.705357,Glenn_,,Reminds me of the time I used to drive a forklift. Works great. I had alot of fun with this. Maybe need to expand to a larger warehouse and alot of things to lift. Also make it realistic by doing damage when hitting the walls etc.,"Jul 29, 2020 at 2:19 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:04:16.808058,ScrewLoose,,Would be good except it ALWAYS puts me too high in the seat.  I can reset height with Oculus but it's trial-and-error and has to be done everytime I make a new try.   could have been a great app,"Nov 13, 2019 at 8:54 PM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 19:04:16.823018,stickyle,,the tilt control is reversed and i'm actually bewildered as to how this can even happen,"Aug 5, 2018 at 3:16 AM",2, 10,This issue has now been resolved.
2022-05-28 19:04:16.836981,BlTEY,Not a simulator!,"This doesn't feel like a forklift, don't even try to learn how to drive one with this app. I doubt the develper ever sat on one, you can clearly see he is steering with his right hand...

I'll list here what is off in hopes he's still interested in further developing this title:
-Sitting position is off, it is too close to the wheel, and too high.
-Steering is horrible (where is the knob?), it turns erratic, it should have about 900* rotation one way (5 turns full lock to full lock).
-Gear changer could be a little bit closer to the wheel, where it is now usually you have a parking brake. -No neutral gear.
-Tilt is reversed!
-Sideshift is reversed! and it doesn't work when you have a pallet on (pallet stay in place, only forks move).
-Can't pick a pallet from the other side.
-Forklift's doesn't have suspension, only rear axle swivels... It tilts too easily with those speeds, you can expect it to sway like this at 10 mph.
-Why have accelerator and brake on buttons when you have analog triggers? You don't have control with buttons, it doesn't even decelerate fast enough when you let go of the button.
-Engine revs doesn't have influence on the speed of lifting, most forklifts I sat on had clutch on a brake pedal, so you can juse it to powerlift.
-Levers should be more gentle, the speed changes the further you move it.","May 1, 2018 at 11:31 AM",2, 105,
2022-05-28 19:04:16.851941,1ce_man,"Good game, but...","Overall I will say it's a fun little game, a bit challenging for newbies. A few things for the dev (if you reading this): Most certainly need a camera reset option. The seat feels really high. I would love to see a Free Roam Mode. Just stick me in a Warehouse with a ton of skids full of stuff and a large number of shelves. No time restrictions, just have a ball. The forklift itself seems really ""springy"" compared to a real forklift (not overly important to change, maybe somewhere down the line). I don't really mind how slow the forklift is, but really could be a bit faster. Maybe some gimmicky things, like a switch for the Warning light on top and so on.

Other then that, good work. Worth getting if you're at all interested in driving a forklift. Operation of the vehicle is relativily accurate.","Apr 5, 2018 at 10:52 PM",4, 43,
