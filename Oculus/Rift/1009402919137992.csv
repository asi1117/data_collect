2022-05-28 16:42:40.620262,veesalazar,Enjoyable,"This is a fun game, something other than shooter games. I really like it. Bugs just a little but the music is catchy and the game play is pretty fun.","Apr 16, 2020 at 7:56 AM",5, 0,Thank you!
2022-05-28 16:42:40.635222,EddieNanakase,Great tower defense game !,"Someone mentioned something about the controls, but the controls seem fine to me.  There are some minor bugs, like the game could get stuck at the end of a level, but it's no big deal, sometimes if you just wait it out for a minute, the game will move on.  There was one instance where I had to restart the app because it froze.  Someone else mentioned that the game got stuck or nothing happened at the end of the last level, but the game probably froze/got stuck because I reached the end of the last level and I was able to finish the game.  I mean, this is a tower defense game, it's not like they tend to have a story that you follow.  There isn't an ending like an adventure game or something to that matter.  The game is a bit short but it evens out a bit with its challenging difficulty.  The visuals look great and are paired with some rather fun audio files.  The short length of the game I would say is it's only con.  If you are into tower defense games, this is a great buy, but again, because of the short length, try to get this game on sale.","Jan 11, 2020 at 4:07 PM",4, 1,"Thank you very much. If you have any thoughts about improvements to the game (in addition to fixing the bug you're mentioning), I'd love to hear them at contact@elementgamesonline.com. Thanks!"
2022-05-28 16:42:40.651179,Anderfit,great game but update messed things up,I was really enjoying this game and now I can't load it anymore since the update a couple of days ago :(,"Jan 30, 2020 at 2:16 PM",2, 0,"Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. We didn't actually release an update at that time, could you let me know what is going on? contact@elementgamesonline.com. Thanks!"
2022-05-28 16:42:40.665142,bigdaddygranpa,no controls,i have the Oculus rift s and i had gotten the free demo for my daughter to see if she liked it and neither the touch controlers nor game pad would work for it .......so i thought it was because it was just the demo so i bought the full game and same thing ......the only way to do anything is to left click on the mouse but then you only get one button and the only thing you can do to your towers is to upgrade (because you only have one button) it would be great to use the touch controlers or at least the gamepad ............please fix .....i don't like wasting money,"Nov 1, 2019 at 4:43 AM",1, 0,I'm very sorry about that and for the delay in responding to your feedback. I will be looking into what might be going on with the Rift S.
2022-05-28 16:42:40.680102,Grumfuttock,Brilliant Game,Very adictive. BUT needs more levels. Completed it in a few hours.,"Oct 20, 2019 at 9:00 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:42:43.812723,ChefRore,Balance the waves,"Levels will always start hard and then get easier, you never start with enough money for the mass amount of cars that are sent on the first wave its pretty ridiculous, other than that its really fun, the levels seem to balance out as the level goes on and you actually have more than just 2 crappy starting towers.","Jul 22, 2019 at 11:58 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 16:42:43.842643,wirelitesoft.dev,Fun but too short,I love this game but the devs need to make it slower and longer. you need to allow people to place things then allow time to upgrade things. you don't give enough time with it slow to add towers and upgrade them. please slow down how many cars come at you and give more time to build andupgradfe by either making cars drop more coins or extend the slow part so people can actualy upgrade things.,"Nov 8, 2018 at 5:25 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:43.856606,ibernet,Bel gioco,"Ottimo Tower, ci si passa qualche ora divertendosi.
Come in molti tower manca il multiplayer, ad ogni modo anche se oggi ci fosse non si riesce a trovare player per fare i doppi.
Non do 5 stelle per il motivo sopra.. arrivando da starcraft dove i tower sono ""infiniti"" circa 10euro per 5-6 mappe penso siano tanti :)
Cmq bello, comprendo che siamo in VR e siamo ancora all'età della preistoria.","Apr 29, 2018 at 2:24 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:43.871566,jack1050,Excellent,"Very addictive. It's a very fun tower defense.
If you find it on sale, you must buy it.","Apr 7, 2018 at 11:40 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:47.001195,Destructor45acp,Is it just me?,"I play lots of tower defence games and this one has a great lay out EXCEPT! I don't know if there is a dificulty setting somewhere I am missing? The second map basicly becomes impossible. You have enough money to start with 2 towers and then they throw everything they got at you. so you have you lose over half your (lives?) to get through that one level. It only gets worse from there. Visuals are great and the game has potential. So either there is a difficulty setting somewhere or Im just that bad at tower defence games. Funny though because I don't have this problem with any other games. Look at Defence Grid 2. Much better game.  This was a waste of 10 bucks.
Update I tried again and again. Level 4 is basicly unbeatable. I was getting so mad I decided to uninstall it before I wrecked something. Don't waste your money.","Nov 15, 2017 at 12:31 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:47.017153,Duncan_Disorderly,Great game. One problem.,"This game is more fun than a barrel of monkeys, if monkeys in a barrel is your thing.  Gameplay is enjoyable and the graphics are brilliant. The board is set out before you and looks like a model car set. 

The one failing is it's far too short. Was hoping the devs would release new levels, but nothing has appeared. Shame.","Nov 5, 2017 at 1:08 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:47.032113,Catnip2,Lots of Fun !!!,"This game is lots of fun, requires strategy & trials & some exploration which was not described in the rules.","Oct 27, 2017 at 10:10 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:47.047073,Jackspcs,glitchy,"controls stop working in the middle of the game, and at the end of I beleive to be the last level nothing happens, as in the level dosn't end as if there are more cars on the board to kill... but there arent... I let the timer goto 30 minutes the first time beating it.. then beat it again 2 more time and the exact same thing happens.. now the controls issue only happened twice but you can grab your mouse and use your left click until you can restart the program. but not being able to progress through the game is just defunct. and makes any value drain from my purchase quick. I tried the demo first and liked it so I knew the game play was worth my money but the camn glitches you only find in the end product....EEERRRHHHH!!! and Ive only owned it for a few hours.... that shows if I can find the issues in 2 hours they arent checking their work before publishing. three stars for the game play that works but no extra due to the issues they need to work on.","Sep 8, 2017 at 1:15 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:47.062033,Ascendor,Fun game - but very very short,"It took me some 3 hours or so to get through completely: 7 maps for 8 EUR.

Apart from that it is a lot of fun and an original idea.","Apr 24, 2017 at 6:12 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 16:42:50.151769,gearvrmagic,"Fun game, but not many levels :(","It's a great game, only let down by the 2 days it took to complete all the levels","Apr 13, 2017 at 12:02 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 16:42:50.166729,andrewmcv,Fantastic tower defense game,"I love this game, and I don't normally like tower defense games. The visuals are fantastic, very cartoony but really, really well done. The choice of weapons and the levels are well spaced out, leading to each level being ""just hard enough"". The control system is very easy, despite occasionally hitting pause instead of ""bombard"".

I can't recommend this game enough - each level is short enough for a casual game each day, but the depth is there and the visuals are pretty spectacular. I love it.","Oct 20, 2016 at 10:21 AM",5, 7,
