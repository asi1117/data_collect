Some levels feel impossible to do but can be done with patience 

Great little game. So much fun
We need this on the quest too","Jun 26, 2019 at 5:47 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:19:33.066395,Gypsy-Joker,Not really for VR - this is a phone game,"imagine a phone platform game, but you are watchiing on a VR headset so it looks like a phone game with the viewers view point just inside the screen, so its looks like you've gone into the platform game so it has a touch of 3D about it but you're still watching from where the screen would be. 
Its a complete waste of the  VR system","Aug 31, 2018 at 5:46 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 19:19:33.081355,FastLawyer,What is up with the negative reviews?,"This game is so much fun. It's hilarious watching the replays. If you played Trials then you know what this game is about. The VR is well done, beautiful set pieces to conquer. I had no problems using my touch controller as a gamepad. My tip is to let go of the throttle after jumps so you then throttle again quickly upon landing to gain maximum speed for the next jump. Best deal on sale for $5 on the Oculus Anniversary sale.

2022-05-28 19:19:33.096315,jothom,Great game inspired by Trials,"Had no difficulties in installation or control problems like the others. Some of the in game levels are certainly overly difficult so it's probably going to challenge most players. There are plenty of online levels to download if you get stuck on one. 

My one suggestion would be to allow a longer cut of after you have fallen off your bike. It's interesting to watch and see where your guy and bike will even end up, long after you bailed. Doesn't matter if either one gets stuck and glitched out, this is part of the fun and should be emphasised by letting it play out another 5 seconds or so. Please consider. :)","Aug 31, 2017 at 7:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:19:33.110278,RealPife,Can't control the bike,I bought the game because it looked great and reminded me of the Trials series. But me and some other players that also purchased Motorbike have had big trouble trying to control the bike and navigating the menus. Some others seem to have more luck. I really hope they fix Motorbike soon so I can give the game a new and perhaps a more fair review. But in the condition it is today (for some players) it's not playable and the game that I regret most that I bought.,"Nov 24, 2016 at 11:41 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:19:36.225944,KevinLongtime,Masterpiece! Loved this game on DK1,"The game feels as if you are driving a toy sized dirtbike similar to that of the scale of Blazerush.

The game features MANY tracks, a built in track editor and also a multiplayer/coop mode. Lots of replayability, lots of frustration trying to get through some of the tough levels and great physics all packed into this title which makes the $10 price tag feel like a great value. The VR element of looking over the track as you controll a toy sized dirtbike zipping through all of the obstacles has a pretty surreal feel to it.

EDIT: FOR THOSE THAT CANT GET THEIR CONTROLLER TO WORK..MAKE SURE YOU CLICK THE GAME WINDOW WITH YOUR MOUSE TO MAKE THE GAME WINDOW ACTIVE.","Nov 17, 2016 at 2:36 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:19:36.241902,r0b1nw,Good but buggy and UI needs work,"Loved this back in 2014 when I purchased my DK2. The version available on Steam doesn't support VR at all, so was delighted to see it arrive on the Oculus Store. Yes, the graphics don't hold a candle to the likes of the Ubisoft Trials games but it doesn't matter - in VR the game is a winner. If the devs would work on the user interface, which isn't the best and sort out the random crashes (assuming I'm not the only one experiencing those on an otherwise stable system) this would be a 5 star recommendation - as it stands, 4 stars.","Nov 18, 2016 at 4:40 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:19:36.256862,Xerphesus,Controller Issues,XBox Controller still not working. Only Playable if you deactivate your xbox controller and play on the keyboard :(,"Jan 26, 2017 at 9:19 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:19:36.270825,SpyderS,Very buggy,I was not able to play. The first time I launched the game it froze and did nothing. The next time I launched it the throttle was stuck on and the bike would instanly flip/start moving forward. I wasn't able to get into the settings either because it's like there is a trigger or button stuck down. Very disappointed. This is the only game in the Oculus store I've had issues with. I would advise in it's current state to stay away. Not worth the hassle.,"Dec 6, 2016 at 11:21 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:19:36.285784,Sandroid,Would be better if controller would work,Controller doesn't seem to work at all. Works fine on everything else. Not as comfortable playing with a keyboard. Otherwise the game would be quite good for the cost. UI does need a lot of work though.,"Nov 20, 2016 at 1:06 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 19:19:39.395467,MunozGirls,Awesome little game!,"I like this game, A lot! So do my 2 nephews! I get it, it's like a phone game.. nothing too special, but with the VR it makes it look as if you're standing right next to it and playing with lets say, hot wheels. Awesome little game!","Nov 28, 2016 at 4:53 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:19:39.409430,pkountanis,Exellent !! Controller work just fine!,"Very good game!!! SUPER ON VR!!! controller work just fine! in the first run controller not working, but next all is ok.
