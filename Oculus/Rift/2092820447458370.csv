2022-05-28 18:25:53.385862,presRoslin,One of the best co-op games,This game rocks.  Thanks for making it online co-op as it makes it even more fun and adds to the playtime!  I've played it several times through with different friends as they get the game,"Apr 19, 2021 at 5:29 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:25:53.402817,KevinOcta,Great but...,"Pretty much everything is great- except for the fact that my wife and I have had so many endless mode runs ruined by glitches.  We will be on round 250 or more and have a glitch ruin our run after already putting in 20 hard-as-you-can-go minutes.  Quite dissapointing for the most competitive players when that happens.  These glitches don't really show up in story mode (I guess it's just too few customers to start to glitch out, which is great!) so that's really fun.  It's still such a fun game that we play every night.  I just would love a few bug fixes for endless mode especially!  
EDIT: Thanks for the dev response! I'm glad to know you're supporting your game! (And we just set a new high score with 0 bugs :D 338 customers- 2 player)","Feb 3, 2021 at 6:55 PM",4, 7,"Thank you so much for the review! We're aware that Endless Mode has some glitches and we've unfortunately not been able to get them fixed yet. We're still on it though, and will do our best to get this to work better."
2022-05-28 18:25:53.418774,Red_Go,Daddy's dream come true,"I really appreciate this game because this is the ONLY game I can play with my 10 years old daughter.  She likes mobile flat screen games a lot but no fan of VR.  I tried several VR games but non of them worked.  I never thought I could play a VR game with my daughter ever, but YES!! this game worked!  

Although campaign mode was a bit challenge for her (after 4th village), she likes the Creative mode so much, we try all different recipes with a pile of ingredients almost up to the ceiling.  To me, it is not just playing game or making sandwiches, it is spending time together.  If you are a father, you would know how rare and precious it could be...  

It's already a great game but if I add some suggestions....  First, it needs pepper (not just shaking one, grinding one).  Second, objects shouldn't be overlapped.  Sometimes, bottles got stuck in the serving table or overlapped each other, plates also got stuck too so I couldn't grab until it re-spawned.  When chaos comes... this overlap thing really gets in a way.  Also one bug I found was I couldn't see the menu of certain customer (it happened only in muti-player, strangely other players could see it but only I couldn't).  

As I already mentioned, this is such a great game and it really shines in mutiplayer.  Try this game with your friends, especially with your children, it worths every single penny.","Dec 4, 2020 at 1:14 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 18:25:53.434731,ShimmeryKimmery,So much fun!,"I absolutely adore everything about this game. Took hubby and I about a week to beat all the levels with 3 stars and the replayability is SUPER high especially with endless mode and creative mode. 

I’d love another story line or more challenges. It’s super fun and engaging. 

Also a huge shoutout to the developers for being so active and helpful on discord!","Dec 16, 2020 at 5:38 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:25:56.549401,Hope2Dopee,Great game (babysitting tool),"This game is so much fun, its a wonderful nod to overcooked! But its clearly being purchased by parents for thier kids so beware of matching mostly into games with kids who are not taking the game seriously at all.","Jan 16, 2021 at 2:51 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:25:56.563363,OscarWhale,So fun!,Fast paced and super fun,"Feb 22, 2021 at 10:30 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:25:56.578323,Frankyboy07,Great VR cooking game!,"This game is a lot of fun to play with friends, the chaos and frantic nature reminds me heavily of Overcooked. I love trying to get 3 stars in all the levels. The new creative mode is a great way to play the game in a relaxing way while trying to puzzle out new recipes. The Devs seem to really respond to player feedback about new features. The great thing is this can be played with more than 1 player on a single account with Rift + Quest! Can't wait to try and 3 star all of the levels!","Dec 2, 2020 at 7:42 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:25:56.593289,tjort,Super fun!,"One of the best multiplayer games in VR yet. Think Overcooked, but with an emphasis on creating the dishes themselves. Even though Cook-Out is at its best and most hectic when playing with friends, solo mode is also a lot of fun. There's a lot of variety, production values are excellent, game mechanics are well thought out and the price is very reasonable. On top of that, multiplayer supports crossplay. Highly recommended!","Nov 11, 2020 at 1:27 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:25:56.608243,Masamune5454,fun game,"my biggest issue, and it may only be happening to me, but when things leave my hand or i throw stuff, the item thrown gets choppy, like a lag spike, but only to the affected thrown object. very odd.
also i wish there was more stuff in single player, like more stuff to mess with and or cooking methods. more fun wackys stuff.
i would say rags to dishes came out around the same time, and as far as single player goes, it is a more enjoyable fun game.
now if multiplayer is better, i will need to try it and add to my review. hopefully i can easily find players","Nov 18, 2020 at 4:21 PM",4, 2,"Hello,  thank you for the review. We haven't had this issue reported before, but we would love to help you look into this. Can you please send us an email at support@resolutiongames.com and we can take it from there?"
2022-05-28 18:25:59.700972,Cribs4140,One of its Kind,"This game is super fun and its not like any other cooking game. Finally a non local multiplayer cooking game with a ton of different modes. It is really cute with the all the fun animals you server and the kitchen you are in. It is really user friendly, and the cooking school tutorial helps a lot. A lot of hours can be spent playing this game since it has a pretty big campaign and there is constant updates adding content.","Oct 30, 2020 at 12:39 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:25:59.715931,Kryssy723,Well Worth It!,"I seen this game way before it came out and patiently waited. Finally it has come out and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Great to play solo or with friend
There are levels that you can complete. There is an endless mode. 
The devs of this game are fully into suggestions from the player.  

MUST PLAY!","Oct 31, 2020 at 1:12 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:25:59.730892,DrMorte,Incredibly fun,"This is really an amazing game and stupidly fun. I can play this for a long run and still won't be tired from it.
I sincerely hope they keep adding content to it, I can't wait for it! The multiplayer is really fun when you get more adult / serious people trying to be ""competitive""","Oct 22, 2020 at 1:43 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:25:59.744854,El_Googlies,"GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!!!","I've been patiently waiting for this game, and I am glad the devs put the work in.  What a great multiplayer game.  Hearing the expressions ""The bread fell off"" ""Stuff is burning"" ""I can't see"" Get the stuff for the rabbit"" have made this game so enjoyable, it will keep you playing for HOURS.  This is unusual for most VR games, especially with people that has motion sickness, but this one will keep you in stitches.  Even in losing, the other three people I first played with were having the time of their lives.  It is easily one of the best VR games, and I'm crossing my fingers for a 4v4 standoff.  That will take this game to other levels of greatness, as if it wasn't great already.","Sep 4, 2020 at 12:58 PM",5, 28,
2022-05-28 18:25:59.759814,Skysolstice,Coop Crossplay and lots of players,Who knew the Rift would have a new game that could bring in so many users to play with.  Join a game and make some friends.  This game becomes unpredictable and fun with a group.  Even better the game is Crossbuy for both Rift and Quest!,"Nov 8, 2020 at 4:41 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:26:02.854537,Jarom,One of the best cooperative VR games yet,"Lot's of people are comparing this to Overcooked and rightfully so but I'd say it leans more towards something like Diner Dash. The reason being is that it has less to do with figuring out how to maneuver level layouts and more to do with task prioritizing. There's plenty of difficulty to enjoy here with optional potions to use if you want to make it a bit easier.

Rough count, I think I saw 23 levels/towns? Each town has 3 ""waves"" each with 3 challenges so there's roughly 70ish levels and 200 challenges to complete.

So far at least it's all the same ingredients for the actual orders. The variety comes from the different kinds of customers and having to decide which to serve first as you scramble to keep on top of all of them. As you make it further in the game, they'll start mixing in other elements like grilling the ingredients or washing dishes.

It comes with crossbuy, cross platform multiplayer, and matchmaking with randos making it one of the few multiplayer gems on the platform that are ticking all the boxes.","Sep 5, 2020 at 3:08 AM",5, 12,

My Initial Impressions:
A great fun multiplayer game from the people who brought us Angry Birds VR and Acron Attack of the Squirrels.","Sep 3, 2020 at 11:57 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 18:26:02.884457,Ryan_IRL,Amazing party game,"I think the ""Overcooked in VR"" comparisons doesn't even do this game justice. This game is really fun, and 3x more fun with friends.","Nov 15, 2020 at 12:14 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:26:02.900414,CoalSlaw,Very Fun If You Have Friends,The mechanics and game play are great but it's extremely difficult to perform well in single player because the bot will interrupt with the wrong ingredients. So make sure you have friends to play with!,"Sep 5, 2020 at 9:51 AM",4, 9,Thanks for the feedback on the AI. We'll keep this in mind!
2022-05-28 18:26:02.915375,DAiiiM,Thanks,Thanks Resolution Games for this funny game. i have already bought Acron: Attack of the Squirrels. Both very nice games that really bring fun. maybe you can still develop an ios/android app like acron so you can play with even more friends  ! 5 Stars!,"Sep 7, 2020 at 2:32 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:26:06.005110,HarbingerThrace,Such a fun game!,"It is the game overcooked wishes it was.  In VR this sort of game is just SO much more fun.  Love it love it.   

And THANK YOU for making it online coop.  My fiancee and I love playing it together =)  I also love my story campaign sort of games like Saints & Sinners, but I balance them out with super fun multiplayer games like these.

Please keep making VR games devs because you are rocking it =)","Jan 2, 2021 at 9:57 AM",5, 0,
