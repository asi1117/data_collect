2022-05-28 13:26:03.252598,StormRising,Exactly what you'd expect,"Love it. Really just Fruit Ninja in VR. Which is nice because I hate when they add stuff no one asked for with games like this. It is about as entertaining as Beat Saber for me and a little more relaxing. Highly recommended as a ""Getting into VR"" game for family or friends that want to try VR out. Also its a great party VR game when lots of people are over. Easy to play, no time wasting stuff, just chopy chop.","Nov 11, 2020 at 5:00 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 13:26:06.400758,RuneSR2,Very simplistic and utterly boring,"Maybe fun in 2016, but no locomotion and just slicing fruit won't turn many heads in 2020. Performance is nice but could be better - performance is worse than Transference, Pistol Whip, Space Pirate Trainer and it's really hard to see why...

2022-05-28 13:26:06.415718,StormyDoesVR,"Fruit Ninja, Now With Visible Swords!","Without a doubt, after almost 3 yeears with this game. I can still say this is one of the most fun games in VR that don't use locomotion. The Fruit Ninja team set out to make a great, challenging sword game in VR, and they 100% did just that!

Coming from the 3rd top ninja in survival mode, I can definitely tell you this game is worth every penny you spend on it. (and no in-app purchases? WAHT??!?) They have periodically over the years continued to drop content updates for this game, which is incredible! Like in early October, 2019, after like, 2 years of the game being pretty much the same, they dropped a HUGE update that adds challenge-unlockable swords into the game! That's insane!  And it's a great, simple way to get me excited to play it more again. I want to unlock as many as I can! That's how you drive people to keep playing. Give them more to do! 

And of course the gameplay is amazing. What's not to love? It's fruit ninja, now with actual katanas! XD","Mar 12, 2020 at 10:28 PM",5, 21,

2022-05-28 13:26:06.461104,Eo-Le,Not worth. Gets boring after 10 minutes,"The game is without doubt more fun to play on VR compare to smart phone. However it gets pretty much boring after 10 minutes. The defend mechanic against bombs by warding it off with the plane surface of the sword sometimes doesn't work. In stead it will cut the bomb, resulting in instant death. There is no tutorials or campaign mode. When cutting the fruits the vibration is either off or too weak, which doesn't give you the real cutting sensation.","Jul 20, 2019 at 1:59 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 13:26:09.563371,ksn,Never though i will play it,"Everyone knows Fruit Ninja. Stupid thing on your phone (for me at least) i bought for money (omg!) and played about 20 mins or so then deleted it and never got back.
I dont remember really how and why i bought this game, probably it was huge discount or so. But... You know mobile Fruit Ninja and Fruit Ninja VR is dam great difference. Suddenlty i found i spent twenty+ hours playing this sh1t =D. I just slashed this fruits again and again and again. This is incredable =).
If you think to have this game prepare to sweat. You will constantly swing your shining swords, no any of treacherous fruits let you to have some rest. The challenge is simple: you or banana. Or pineaple. No other options. This is SPARTA!
Definitely recommend to have this thing in your collection!
The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is existence of games like Lone Echo or Robo Recall or something like that. Because it is just unfair to give 5 stars to games like Lone Echo and games like Fruit Ninja >_<. Sorry Fruit Ninja, nothing personal.","Jun 13, 2019 at 7:08 AM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 13:26:09.579836,The_Virtual_SAMURAI,Love This Game! 1 issue tho,"Review Update V2 Stiill loving this game love the updated scenery etc but my Rift S controllers occasionally go out of bounds knocking all the survival cannons out of bounds causing them to shoot the wall and giving me Xs. I guess it just looses tracking when it goes out of range and just flies across the level ruining the game for me.

2022-05-28 13:26:09.595793,Tisdamcs,Fun!,I enjoyed fruit ninja on my phone for about a month and unfortunately that’s all I enjoyed the VR version for as well.  I still really enjoy the game and go back to it from time to time. It could really use some different challenges and it definitely isn’t worth more than 5 dollars.

2022-05-28 13:26:09.610753,Vantablack_,Gets boring very fast,"Bought this game on discount for 6,99 Euro. But thats still too much. I played this for maybe 10 mins now and I am already bored. The visuals are fine but could be better. I do not like, that the fruits do not fly high. I always have to look down. Seems like this game does not have a variable height. In fact it has no settings at all. As I am 195 cm tall this bothers me a lot. You have so much space in VR yet all I do is look down. The game is pretty easy as well. It could be more challenging.
To cut fruits does not feel as satisfying, as I expected. If you played Beat Saber you wont be impressed by this game. I would invest more hours in it. 
Might be cool to show it to friends, because they probably know Fruit Ninja and will be able to play this game with no instructions, but this game is wasted just potential. It is currently not worh its price.","Apr 1, 2019 at 3:27 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 13:26:12.769871,KokoTheDragon,just not fun.,"it could be fun, it's just not. 

you could tie a controller to a fan and get a top score. There's no deepth or skill, just RSI. 

there's no haptic feedback when you hit fruit, the fruit is just thrown randomly and there's really no technique needed to hit it. 

such a boring implementation of what use to be a very inovative game.","Sep 3, 2018 at 2:48 AM",1, 30,
2022-05-28 13:26:12.785829,Juinn,It's OK,"+It's Fruit Ninja in VR
+Visuals are fine
+It's a functional game

-Lacks depth 

I wouldn't pay the going rate of $14.99 USD; it's a $4.99 value tops. Maybe there was a point in time that justified the current price, but we're past that point now. For the money there are better experiences out there. It was the first VR game I bought and I mostly bought it because I wanted that hack and slash VR swordplay experience, and there wasn't much else going on at the time. And don't get me wrong it was fun for a minute, but only just, and even at the time I just thought it was OK.  There's a couple game modes, 'Don't drop the Fruit', 'Look out for bomb', and 'Try to hit the fruit for a minute(s)', but none of them are great. 

There is so little to it that I don't feel compelled to play it and I barely even register it as an activity to be experienced now. Honestly I probably get as much if not more out of the phone app, which had (has? ... confirmed, present tense, has) a more aggressive development roadmap, while VR seems to be content as it is (VR doesn't seem to have done anything to add content or run an event besides basic maintainence since January 2017 as far as I can tell), so it's a bit much to pay 15 bucks just to play it in VR.

That said, if you really like Fruit Ninja, you'll probably like Fruit Ninja VR and maybe get it at some point.","Jul 4, 2018 at 12:22 PM",2, 39,

2022-05-28 13:26:15.896574,LeChimp7,"The best hop-in, hop-out game I've found","This takes a decent mobile game and makes it a fantastic VR diversion.  Survival Mode is my favorite, where a hovering basket launches bunches of fruit at you. As time goes on, more baskets fly in. 
It's a great starting point for people who are hesitant to try VR for fear they'll get motion sick. You don't move your feet, but there's plenty of solid hand movement that will get them excited.
One gripe I have is that the bombs in Survival Mode seem much harder than usual to deflect, but I suspect I'm just not thinking of something.","Jun 16, 2018 at 4:07 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 13:26:15.914525,Sinistic,A VR must have!,"So I´ve owned the oculus for a couple of weeks now. And logically I scanned the internet to find out what the best games are. Especially the gems/essentials you cannot miss out on if you own VR. And titles that have you coming back so they last. Nowhere in the video's or top 10-25 lists did I see Fruit Ninja. While it should be in there and it should be somewhere in the top. 

This game is an absolute must have. It's almost like Fruit Ninja was originally designed with VR in mind. You have so much more control over what you slice and you actually feel like a Fruit Ninja when doing so. It's fun, satisfying and so easy to pick up for everyone. You also don't need to move much (Your feet that is. DO make sure you have enough arm room :P). You'll have the same game modes as on the tablet version. Plus a new survival mode which is challenging and a nice twist on the concept. 

If you own a VR headset, buy this game. Worth every penny!","May 8, 2018 at 1:02 AM",5, 6,

I'd be nice if i could swap by off hand for a tanto instead of a full length blade, prevent accidents(at least that is what itel myself) Custom blades would be an awesome uipgrade too, if you listening devs. Thanks for the great game too. the survival mode is very fun.","Oct 1, 2017 at 2:46 PM",4, 6,

BUT! This game is the most fun I had with the VR up to this point. 
As a point of reference: I played Dead and Buried and Robo Recall for most of the time. And these game sure are very good aswell. However Fruit Ninja VR made me do work out while having fun. I play a couple of hours every day now and I start to see results. 
And believe me I am not one of these couch potatoes.........you have to swing like you have a sword however (because twisting around with the controller like they would be fans works aswell.

Some times the bomb will go off even though I could swear I hit it on the flat side and then I would knock the fruits I would try to stab. Other than that this is a real fun and movement of a game.

2022-05-28 13:26:25.437829,HarmlesssPotato,Not bad. Not great.,"You would think the swords in game would align with the handles of the touch controlers, but you'd think wrong. They're oddly misaligned causing some accidental bomb hits. I often go to bump a bomb off to the side and it explodes, and I go to cut a fruit and it gets bumped off the screen. The new game mode is an interesting concept, but to make it challanging, the flying robots shoot the fruit in a way that forces you to impossibly contort your arm to not lose. All that being said, I did have good fun flailing around dicing up fruits but never for more than a few minutes until the novelty wears off. Would I recommend purchasing this game? Maybe if you have kids who love fruit ninja and want to play with your $600 toy, or want to watch your drunk friend flop around punching your furniture.

But the lack of resistance in the motion controls definitely makes it feel odd compared to a real sword - more like a light saber. It's quite challenging, throwing a huge number of fruit at you in quick succession, and I can't even begin to approach the top of the leaderboards. The main issues: very little tutorialization, you're dumped in the deep end; and for those who aren't competitive on the world stage it's not very satisfying to get your rank from #212 to #190.

2022-05-28 13:26:41.192809,Hyomoto,"Fun, but expensive","This is one of those games I imagine will be forgotten as VR develops as a platform, but for now it's constructed well enough and is fun in short bursts.

Oh, and 15 dollars is insane.  If you can get it on sale do that.","Dec 26, 2016 at 9:47 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 13:26:41.208767,jmalmsten,Very easy to use and fun. Just a few nit,"I had always heard about Fruit Ninja but never tried it myself. But as I now got Touch I figured I had to try it out. And boy am I out of shape! 15 min in and I'm already  working up a sweat. The gameplay is very straight forward (altough I thought I was supposed to be able to fling the bombs away, but everytime I try they explode in my face. Must be some technique I'm missing). There is a bit of mystery meat navigation going on and I keep hitting the menu and oculus buttons when things get frantic which is never a problem in other games. But all in all. It is a fun little game that you can whip out and have some fun with I think.","Dec 10, 2016 at 8:34 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 13:26:41.224723,jn110,No surprises but good fun,"The swords are very responsive and chasing the leaderboards in the various modes is good fun.

2022-05-28 13:26:41.240681,RedJimi,A fast way to get a craving for fruit!,"Some juicy fruitsalad here. You could want more, but you have to appreciate how the original cellphone game (and a Kinect version) is growing into a whole series of good quality slicing games. Multiple modes like with the originals. Enjoyable, simple, fun.","Dec 21, 2016 at 8:05 AM",3, 1,
