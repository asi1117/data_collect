2022-05-28 17:17:06.170169,Alicia_Wonderland,Ugh. Why?,"It looks like a lot of time was put into this long boring, dark, bleak, slow, sleep-inducing experience.  Why? I literally fell asleep at the end so not sure how it ended. Long slow elevator rides with droning music.  Long slow movement throughout the entire thing with very little to look at but dark bleak surroundings without much in them. A pseudo-plot that was hard to follow. If the developers put as much time into something with a good plot, good writing, attractive visuals and good pacing, maybe they’d have something, but this is just awful. If you want to watch something to put you to sleep then have nightmares, get this.",Jan 22 at 10:02 AM,1, 1,
2022-05-28 17:17:06.185129,baysail,A must try - Very Talented Team,"Although this has been abandoned and crashes on the first chapter, you can easily skip the first chapter on relaunch to finish the experience.  It is only a short 'movie' experience however you are allowed limited head movement which is really interesting.  Maybe I'm missing something but I have not seen this before that i recall.
I call it a must try because the camera movement, lighting, and rendered environment are all top notch and unique.  The blurry rendering is deliberate and addes to the mystery.  I expect great things from the individuals involved in this in whatever they do in the future.  Thanks for the experience!","Jan 13, 2019 at 12:58 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 17:17:06.200089,Mach13-13,Just doesn't deliver.... it fatal errors,"Version for this review 0.9.3.8
I don't like giving neg reviews, but i really don't see the point of offering this up (even if it is free) when it clearly doesn't run.  Starts with a very  360 atmospheric scene, there's no free movement, it's as if your a 360 camera on rails.  That would be fine but a short while in and it crashes a the same point each time.

UPDATE 2 months later:  erm still fails at the very same point...  will come back to it if ever there's an update.","Feb 24, 2019 at 4:25 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 17:17:06.214052,pabe05,Still worth watching,"Yeah it crashing in first chapter.  Watch it till it crashes,  restart after closing .  Restart and skip to next chapter using the A button select arrow right.  Violent futuristic experience that  you really must see.  I would like to see more but it looks like not enough paid interest was generated to continue project.","Dec 29, 2018 at 9:19 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:17:06.228014,Nordri666,I was really curious how it goes but,it crashes a couple of minutes after the episode 1 starts (then the guard gets closer to the broken door).  SHAME. It should  be fixed or deleted from the store.,"Feb 13, 2019 at 10:13 PM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 17:17:12.534148,Azazel08,Not what it could be,"This could be made into an excellent experience, but development for this title appears to have stopped. I bought back when it first came out and did not finish it hoping that the devs would update it to improve the clarity of visuals. Instead, now the movie crashes in the same scene everytime. I skip this scene so that I can continue and just get more grainy, blurry graphics that go with a story and art style that I really could enjoy. In one scene there is a cigarette the size of a baseball bat and it is so blurry I could barely tell what it was at first.

Please fix this mess and maybe take a look at John Carmack's 5k pre-render technique and this could be a solid experience. If you were able to do this as Oculus as done Henry then I think it could be a 5 star experience and I would look forward to future releases.","Aug 15, 2018 at 1:57 PM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 17:17:12.565065,Aquavemo,Interesting but always crashes :/,"I had to skip the first chapter because it crashed every time at a certain scene. I really liked the atmosphere of it and the people who made this surely know how to make proper shots and camera movements, they really put some thoughts into it! It gave me (and maybe this sounds weird) a ""PS2""-feeling/vibe while watching it, reminding me of the games that came out back then. Something about the style/theme is very similar. The sense of scaling is also really well. BUT: the change of perspective (e.g. the close-ups) don't work at all and the overall look is too dark/saturated. Also, the story is not ""groundbreaking"" and is told very vague. All in all an interesting experience with some flaws (and a crash!) and the opportunity to do better in the next episode (if there will be one).","Jan 23, 2018 at 5:33 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:17:12.581022,rh_galaxy,"First it worked, now not","When I installed in 2017 it worked fine, and was a good experience. Now when I run it it crashes with a ""Device Lost"" error a couple of minutes in, tried 3 times.

Update: fixed it by creating a bat file in the game directory with this line ""KCD_S01E01.exe -dx12"" then run the bat file from explorer.

Update half a year later: There is a simple fix out to get it to release state again, and the team have had 6 months to do it, and failed. They talk about ep 2, and I would gladly BUY a working ep 2, but this indicates it's another 6 years in the future if ever... Fix this title and I give it a 4 star. Now I remove a star.","May 12, 2018 at 1:05 AM",1, 2,"Yikes! We are so sorry about this! We are working hard on releasing an update with the latest version of Unreal 4 that SHOULD fix all the crashing issues. Its weird, the same thing is now randomly happening on our end too.

2022-05-28 17:17:12.595982,GrimPilgrim,Don't bother,While the aesthetics and design is good enough the atrocious grain filter and constant scale changes ruin the experience completely!,"Dec 22, 2017 at 6:11 AM",2, 1,"Hey sorry about the grain, it is due mainly to the low screen space percentage. You can pause the experience at anytime and turn the quality up, that reduces most of the grain. Thanks for watching!"
2022-05-28 17:17:15.673750,evercltech,welcomed change of experience,"The feel for this episode sets expectations that are confirmed with the closing scenes. I am looking forward to the next episode like no other and I hope there are more series like this. After years of binge-watching, I have noticed that I stopped watching not only broadcast television from the classic operators but also stopped watching episodic series in general. This platform created a new experience. I am curious to see the difference between the end of the season and the first episode. The engagement I got with this perspective makes for an interesting awareness that compares to that of a ride.","Sep 29, 2017 at 9:06 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 17:17:15.703670,VRBaers,The future of entertainment,"This wasn't a perfect experience by any means. There were extremely jarring camera angles, something I can only call giantism in certain shots (extremely large characters) and some moments where it was really hard to make out anything. All of that said however this was an absolutely amazing experience and it left me amazed at the potential of this medium. The last scene literally gave me the chills even though at that point I still felt disconnected from the main character. This is it people, the future of entertainment lies in the refinement of what this series represents.","Aug 25, 2017 at 12:38 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:17:15.719627,KSic,Update: Game works!,"Update: So this wasn't working for me but I solved the issue! This experience shows huge promise. Though their team still has lots to learn, I do think they could create something very special with the coming chapters. I can tell they really care about this project. They have my support! Keep in mind, this is a hit or miss with people it seems but I think it's worth checking out because it just has so much potential. I do wish the story had more though. The ending scene was very cool. Made me want to explore so bad! Haha. I think the biggest issue is this almost felt like a trailer for this AMAZING adventure. If they can nail the payoff, it will be a very exciting time to be a VR lover.","Aug 26, 2017 at 9:08 PM",5, 5,"Very sorry about the crashes, we're of course very interested in getting this fixed immediately.  I'm not sure why our website didn't have our e-mail address on it, one of the other devs accidentally removed it but thank you for making this known to us.  We are available at kingdomcitydrowning@gmail.com, feel free to contact us any time.  We heard one report that a particular antivirus app was causing a crash on one occasion but were unable to reproduce on our end as of yet- we're still diagnosing the cause but this might be an area to look at for now as we dig deeper.  Again- this is the last thing we want and will make it right.  Thank you for your patience and for checking out the series!"
2022-05-28 17:17:15.734588,MarquisDeSang,Stop playing with the scale!,"The scale of things is constantly changing from normal 1:1 to 10:1. For example the main charter is 5'9"", then he is 16 feets, then 100 feets finally back to normal human size without any reason. That totaly destroys the experience. Stop using depth of field in VR my eyes are not a camera. Crash constantly (have to skip chapters to be able to see some part of it). Too dark and too blurry. Really good music and really interesting universe. It's not too late for the dev to fix the scaling to 1:1 and I will give it 4 stars. I cannot recommend this VR experience without the scaling fixed.","Sep 20, 2017 at 8:02 AM",1, 2,"Sorry you didn't like the scale changes. That decision was more artistic than practical- we wanted the viewer to feel disoriented, helpless and insignificant. Something to let the audience know they have no control and no ability to effect the world."
2022-05-28 17:17:18.833299,pigtripper,"Maybe for $1...No, probably not.","First the good:  It's atmospheric and the music doesn't suck.

Now the bad:  Oh, where to start?

I expected a well-directed, cinematic short film with different camera angles, cuts, etc.  Not so much.

The camera literally never stops moving.  It just moves around the action ALL THE TIME.  And speaking of moving, at least 50% of the ""film"" is the camera following someone while they are walking or riding in an elevator.  Literally, 50%.  Like, twelve minutes of just following people or things.

Then there's the scale issues.  It's starts out at human scale but then we venture into the ""Land of the Giants.""  I don't know if the directors were trying to do close-ups, but they don't work like that in VR.  You're walking behind someone (again) and they are human-sized, and then the camera moves and they are freaking Godzilla-sized.

The skins on the characters look like they are from 2002, and the animation of the characters is pretty bad as well.

Then there is the story, or lack thereof.  None of it made any sense.

The developers are just learning this stuff, so hopefully the next episode will show some marked improvement.

But for now, I want my $4.99 and 23 minutes back.

EDIT:  I appreciate the positive developer response below and hope they make some big strides for Episode 2.","Aug 23, 2017 at 6:33 AM",1, 15,"We all really appreciate you responding and giving us your critique! Sorry you didn't like the experience. We're all learning from the ground up on how to make a VR film, so it's been a bumpy ride, lots of trial and error. Hopefully you will dig episode 2, we're gonna experiment and focus more on characters and pacing. 

Best!

2022-05-28 17:17:18.863219,importantperson,"Not perfect, but feels special/unique","This probably won't be for everyone, but if you're into dark gritty sci-fi I absolutely recommend (extremely dark at times NOT for kids). Very poetic dialogue and disturbing visuals. It's hard to follow at times and pretty slow, but really impressive effort. Excited to see Episode 2. I think this could be the start of something great.","Aug 22, 2017 at 10:36 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 17:17:18.878179,cherylbock,One wild ride!,"I have to disagree with the other viewers who found this boring.... to me it was filled with tension and extremely brutal and dark, leaving me with a constant sense of foreboding. It's like you're being dragged through a violent unforgiving world. The slow pace is not for those with short attention spans, but for anyone who likes to soak in atmosphere and a story that requires effort I encourage you to check it out, it is extremely unique and artistic with an awesome soundtrack. My main complaint would have to be the lack of deep three dimensional characters. I'm hoping for more character development in the upcoming episodes. Also as others have said, the scaling issues are very disorientating (albeit pretty cool). I also had some strange popping audio issues that persisted through most of the experience.","Aug 26, 2017 at 6:59 AM",4, 8,
