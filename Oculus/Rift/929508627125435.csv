2022-05-28 14:25:50.930371,honor_47,One of best VR games,"This game is basically Dark Souls for VR. Camera is fixed, but it's totally ok. Graphics are absolute top. Very good game of shadows, lightenings and very nice textures. Sound patterns, and everything around sound is great. Game is not just some stupid hack'n'slash adventure. It's coming with LOTS of original and very surprising mechanics, for example aging 1 year on death is very good idea. Combats are fun. I'm playing it on hardest difficulty (one of three) and it's very challanging (and I'm pretty sure I will not finish it on my first time). Story is good, and simple to understand (not like Dark Souls). This is totally must have for anyone who have PCVR and Oculus headset.",Aug 20 at 5:35 AM,5, 15,

Not only do I love the 3rd person perspective, the graphics are sooo good, and the controls are perfect *(just be careful of accidentally pressing Y button, as it will irritate you to no end lol) I managed to beat the game at age 60, but I was very meticulous, paying close attention to selecting particular skills, in order to achieve the most success. This game has great replay value, as I have all 3 save slots in various stages of life: young, middle aged, and elderly. Progression system is really cool as you have many different options and ways in which you can master your skills and level your character and weapons up. Like I said above, this is my favorite title! A must own, in my honest opinion. Happy gaming, and Goodluck with the final end boss: Dragon! He is psycho!",Jul 9 at 1:16 AM,5, 8,

Edit @ july 2021..... reinstalled.... after multiple tries, eventually got past the menu into the game.... only to find that the controls are ALSO BROKEN.... I can't even USE the in game menus/ options and inventory.... because the A button acts like the left menu button. It does the same while your playing, so you can't do any action that requires the A button. There's a bit fairly early on where you use a small key on a computer and are supposed to then select an option on the computer.... doesn't work because the controls are BROKEN.

2022-05-28 14:25:54.110018,OrionInHades,This shows the potential of VR,"I get motion sickness, so first person games in VR are hit or miss. If I can teleport I'm fine, if it's a walking type motion, I'm cooked. I was hesitant to buy this game, but boy was I wrong! The graphics are awersome, the story is awesome, and the expereince is immersive. This is just a fantastic game, even if you like first person. It's games like this that really highlight the power of VR. I wish that some of the bigger developers would get in the game. Imagine Abe's World, Dante's Inferno, God of War, Xcom, ect., all brought to life in VR. There is so much power here, so much promise. I hope the developers of this game keep going and produce more content. Fantastic job, fantastic game!

I see some people talking about the controls. All I can say is that my Oculus Rift S controllers did not work. The game didn't even start. So, I went and bought a Steelseries Stratus Duo, at Wallyworld. Right out the box it worked perfectly, and the game started up and worked fine. This controller mirrors an XBox, so if you know your way areound that, this controller should be no problem.","Dec 25, 2020 at 10:03 AM",5, 20,

From the very beginning of this title I found it difficult to end it and take a break because I so wrapped up on the visuals, the story, the adventure. I just don’t understand why there’s no more games like this and because I would have them in my library in a heartbeat. So if you are looking for something new to try don’t miss this title it was amazing! ( Where are you Gunfire Games?)","Aug 31, 2020 at 5:16 AM",5, 23,

However, this is such a beautiful game.  Story, gameplay, music still compel me to write this review, even though I first played this when it released.  I figured every decent developer would quickly follow, but alas, my heart still yearns for this one.
I really wish I could erase that part of my mind and play this again for the first time...or they would at least make a sequel!?!

2022-05-28 14:25:57.267185,Elbie,"OK, but doesn't really work","The third-person perspective doesn't really work, and the controls feel clunky.  This would be much better as a first-person game with touch controllers for blocking and attacking.  Not sure why they didn't go that route.  I guess they couldn't nail the first-person perspective / controls, or the graphics look great when scaled down for a whole room on screen, but up close in first person they're not 100%.  It's... OK.  Maybe you get used to it if you force yourself to play it more.","Aug 15, 2020 at 6:16 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 14:25:57.282145,BobertTheThird,Zelda and Dark Souls had a baby in VR,"Title says it all. Gameplay is amazing. Graphics are amazing. Controls are your normal gamepad setup so they are fairly intuitive. The 3rd person view is a little unexpected in a VR title, but it works extremely well in this game. The game is challenging similar to Dark Souls, but it is forgiving enough that more casual players can get into it as well (especially if they play on easy, like my wife did) on the flip side dying is very much a part of the game, and while slightly annoying, can be used strategically to advance through the game.","Jun 17, 2020 at 12:06 PM",5, 16,

I am stuck, and I don't think the game actually progresses, there must be a glitch. I invested probably 25-30 hours into this title, and the walkthrough online is showing that you can progress, but I can not.  What is going on here?  Twice, two separate attempts, two separate computers.  I have been everywhere, there is a door that does not open, a path that can't be followed after beating a major boss, so I think the title is broken.",Feb 1 at 10:06 AM,2, 2,
2022-05-28 14:25:57.312065,Satconcook,Remnant:From the Ashes Prequel...,"I played Remnant:From the Ashes before I even knew about this game and now I feel like I have played them out of order, as this was like a prequel. There is no doubt that Chronos ties into Remnant directly with the same environment, playstyle and many of the same enemies. Now I wish Remnant had a VR mode to it so I could play in the same manner. I managed to beat it in a bit over 11 hours playing on Adventure and even had a few moments of frustration. I think the one thing that kind of disappointed me is the constant changing of camera angle. One moment you are pushing right to go across the screen, go through a doorway to now need to press left to keep going in the same game direction. This became a bit frustrating when the changed direction could lead you off an edge. There were moments the mechanics of waiting for a hit to finish before you can dodge upset me, but it is kind of the same in Remnant and becomes all about timing and knowing your enemy.

I absolutely love the third person aspect in VR because it puts me in the environment with the character. I felt more emotionally attached to the character instead of it being me. In one area scale is used to make you smaller and then larger and it is perfect for VR. The game is mostly fighting enemies and collecting items to solve puzzles to gain access to the next area. The leveling and age mechanic with death is interesting and along with leveling up your weapon of choice, the only way to successfully get through the game. I want more games like this.","May 21, 2020 at 11:28 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 14:25:57.328022,HenrySlim,Amazing game in Third person,"First I will talk about THIRD person.

I like first person too but in third person you have some adventages like:

- In all the games you can play sitting very useful when you don't have a big room
  to move like me.

- The fights don't get you tired like in first person because to attack you use 
  the buttons of the joystick not the move of your hands.

- You can see the monsters in third person and is not too much scared like in the
  first person. 

Now I will talk about the GAME:

-The game is brilliant.
 They use cameras with a fix point of view where you can only move your head to 
 look around. 
 This style of cameras remind me games like ""Alone in the Dark"" but in VR so is
 very beautiful.

-The scenarios and graphics are very cool and differents.
  There are some mountains of rocks that remind me the game ""Another World"" 
  (another classic).

-The fight at the beginning is not easy but when you know the controls well is very
 funny because there are different enemies and you need to use different tactics
 to defeat them.

-The game have a part of RPG with an inventary and puzzles so is very good and 
  you can talk with some characters.

-And the game is very long song you have a lot of scenarios and deserve the price.
 
Things to improve:

-The part o RPG is good but will be better with more weapons, objects and 
  characters to talk and the end of the game is not the better.

Conclusion:

-The game is brilliant and I think that this kind of games in third person is very 
 useful to create classic adventure games like ""Monkey Island"" or ""King Quest"" but 
 with action too.
 
I wish the companys will create new games like this in Third person for VR","Apr 16, 2020 at 4:26 PM",5, 19,

2022-05-28 14:26:00.420892,threeyedraven,A must own game,Chronos was made by the same developers as Dark Souls so if you played Bloodborne on PS4 you'll get a good idea of what kind of game this is. Even if you werent a huge fan of Bloodborne I think that most will like Chronos. Its combat is challenging and the enviorments are huge and a little confusing so its easy to get lost or remebering how to get back to the locked door you just found the key for.

Love the effects, the fighting style and the puzzles. When I started the game years ago almost gave up right at the start, spent a lot of time looking for a way to open what later I found was an endgame door. Once I understood how the game worked I could not stop playing it. Some times would skip working out just to get some more time playing. Graphics are clean, game play is addicting. I definitely recommend it.","Nov 28, 2019 at 5:07 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:26:03.612501,Jensoma,Could be an amazing game,"Nice graphics, decent story and some new ideas makes this game an interesting one. The only two things i really don't like are the controlls and the camera. Often it is very hard to hit your oponent because you cannot move or turn the camera. I understand that this prevents motion sickness but for me it's annoying. 

Even more annoying is that the character stops to fight when he charges up with ""super"" power. I died a lot because of this and stopped playing for now.

All in all a good game for 10 bucks, but i wouldn't pay more.","Nov 13, 2019 at 9:12 AM",3, 3,

I played for several weeks, twice with the ""Heroic"" level until I gave up at 80 years old (each time your character dies, you age 1 year), then with the ""Adventure"" level, until the end.
Fights, puzzles and the universe are very well done.
But fights were sometimes challenging. Also, the arcane is controlled by the thumbstick button, not the trigger button. Also, I often used the wrong button and drank the life (dragon) potion when I didn't want to. Grrr!...","Nov 3, 2019 at 3:24 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 14:26:06.752232,virtuulz,"Excellent game, little replay","This game is awesome, graphics are beautiful, sound/music works very well with the environment. Character leveling works OK, I wish the magic use had more value, but fighting is really good, basically 2 options: Sword-n-Board or Dodge and strike. Replay could be better if the magic use had more options. Leveling weapons is slow at the start, and my first play-through I was quite discouraged, until later in the game when upgrades were readily available, and I had too many items to bother upgrading any weapon, the ones I could use for my fighting style were already maxed.
The environments are well done, and I found myself looking around a lot, capturing all the elements around me.
The puzzles are not too difficult, younger players can solve everything without much trouble.
3 difficulty settings also allow another play-through. Doing the middle-tier (Adventurer) worked very well for my first play though. I am starting my second play with the opposite fighting style, and doing the most difficult option. I expect, and want, to die often to age in this game. You get age-based abilities, and I didnt get past the first 2 my first time through.
This is why I gave this 4 stars. There's just a slight disconnect in leveling and aging and game progression. I really wanted to give this 5 stars!!! It is a very well done game!","Oct 4, 2019 at 4:24 AM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 14:26:06.789640,WakiPaki,"Started Strong, finished weak.","The premise alone is worth looking into it; the aging of your character tweaking how your stat upgrades cost as your youth wanes and your mind expands, along with unique traits every 10 years to show your training in between. 
The visuals are stellar, no two ways about it. It's gorgeous and really shows off the VR Tech's graphics and detail capabilities, along with the sound design.
Gameplay wise, it's kind of like Dark Souls and Resident Evil. From RE it takes the fixed camera among the scenery:  and from Dark Souls it takes most of the combat's feel. Pick a Strong or Agility weapon type and then either block or dodgeroll your way to victory for most of the enemies. The parrying mechanic, however, kind of sucks since it's a risky proposition and if you scuff it, you're getting hit. To heal, you have Dragon Hearts which are basically estus flasks that only refill when you die and advance another year, making it very tense when you're low on health trying to push through a maze-like environment. Lots of looping around and doors opening from only one side with inventory puzzles dotted across them, though some of those puzzles are really cool, specifically in the early first area. Later on, they get less creative and more obvious once you have the pieces. The most blatantly boring one is a sliding tile puzzle near the end.
One of the troubles with the gameplay is that there are four stats you invest points into and one is pointless. Arcane only effects elemental damage to your chosen enchantment, no spells or anything cool, so just dump all your points in vitality and whichever melee type you want.
And the twists. I won't spoil. But the main twist is pretty obvious to savvy roleplayers. There's other stuff which is very cool and clever, but good luck seeing it on the first run. 
The ending? Disappointing. It feels like there should've been multiple endings and you got a bad one, but there's only one. Heard maybe sequel, but no guarantee.
Buy cheap.

2022-05-28 14:26:06.806595,Comrade_Ivan,Pros & Cons,"Pros: visually stunning, great atmosphere.
Cons: 3rd person view of a human-sized character in VR? Poor choice imho. Also, counterintuitive controls; POV that shifts from side to side, making it difficult to orient oneself in 3D space; annoying 1-2 sec delay when swinging a sword (apparently, delaying a swing while battling an opponent is a feature as described in game); way overpriced for the experience.

2022-05-28 14:26:06.826541,Skuggfax,"Beautiful game, great experience","It's a brilliant game in many aspects. The leveling and aging system is unique and interesting. The graphics are beautiful with many stunning places to explore. Gameplay is fun, challenging and engaging. If you like a challenge in your games with a slower progress as well as some exploration and puzzle solving then this is the game for you. I would have liked to see a few more options for ways to engage in combat and different kinds of weapons. The arcane stat is a bit lackluster in my opinion. I would have liked to see some more things done with magic in combat like some cool spells to throw out and not just making your weapon swings hit harder. These are minor details though, overall I had a ton of fun playing Chronos and will probably go back and play it again. The story ended on a cliffhanger which was a shame but hopefully that means we're getting a part two.","Aug 7, 2019 at 4:46 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 14:26:09.956753,andrewtek,"Good game, unsatisfying ending","As the title says, the game is good but the ending is unsatisfying.

I would give the game 1 more star if the gameplay were better and 1 more if the ending were better. As it is, the gameplay suffers. There are essentially 3 major moves in combat: Hit, Block and Parry. Unfortunately, the timing for Parry is really hit-and-miss. It seems tied to the animation of the enemy you are fighting and if you do not hit the parry button at precisely the right point in the animation, you receive major damage. The other issue is the camera positions when going from one room to another. When transitioning from one room to another, the angle of the camera in relation to your character may be very different. Unfortunately, this means that if the character was going right along a ledge one room, in the next he will immediately be going left and over the cliff. 

Hearing Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway from Star Trek Voyager) tell the opening story was great. With as much effort as was put into the beginning story, and with all the effort put into the little scrolls and books throughout the game - how could the ending be so disappointing?

Overall, I would not recommend this game. If you put several hours into beating a game, it should feel rewarding.","Jun 3, 2019 at 10:05 AM",3, 7,

Puzzles that had no real clues how to solve other than read a walkthrough, having to clear out a level with the same enemies each time after you die, extremely poor combat mechinics (character would constantly stop to do something where the axe would glow - completely stopping a fight so I would die), having to run back to a boss each time you died, no health bar on enemies to tell if you were close to winning or not, pulling up the menu didn't pause the game meaning switching weapons would  get you killed, etc, etc. If the game had been done right it really would have been fun but I'm not playing ever again.

Pretty much!,"Other than the stationary camera that changes depending on your location, Dark Souls fans are going to get the dose of Dark Souls victory and frustration (but if only if you play on hard.) The atmosphere is breathtaking, so stop and look around everyone once and a while. This game is unsettling, and carries with it a dark sci-fi fantasy overtone with moments that will make you turn tail and run to safety. Skill customization is low, and the game is personal-skill dependent: you're going to have to practice timing or 'get gud.' Not a game I'll showcase at a friend/family gathering, but one I love to play when I'm alone and can focus.  I have never experienced any glitches or interruptions playing on a 1060, and the load times are fairly quick.

At the beginnig it was very difficult for me, but after you know how to fight your enimies it gets better. It is always the same. You wait till the monsters attacks you and then you rather block or dodge it and then you make like one hit and then again wait, block and attack. That is basicly how you defeat every enemie from the small ones to the big end bosses. And this is what it makes it boring. You defeat nearly everything the same way. Everything else of the game is great. Maps are looking good. The fixed Camera sometimes can bother you but its fine. The story is kinda intersting. And I never played a game where your character gets one year older each time you die, that is something new and intersting. You also die a lot, just like in Dark Souls and then you have to walk the same way again back to where you died, this sometimes sucks, but you can unlock shortcuts. I wich the enemies had a healbar, so I could know how close I wad to defeating a boss. All in all I can recommend this game.","May 26, 2018 at 3:44 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:26:35.330594,Remerai,"Good, but a little derivative.","From very early on in the adventure, I could tell that Chronos was going to be a good example of what one could do with VR, it also holds up as a game on its own merits.

You play this game in third-person, your camera practically being a fly on the wall. I see a lot of people dreaming about what VR could be in first person, but this game might prove that a good old classical  third-person perspective has more potential. It smartly switches to first-person when one is examining an item in the environment, either to let you read a text or as an opportunity to use a key. 

The way it handles your perspective is smart, as it allows for a comfortable yet immersive experience that doesn't distract too much by disorienting you as less elegant VR games tends to do. It was impossible not to notice that when you switch camera position, the new angle is most likely going to be pointed to where your eyes are already focused, making transitions jump comfortably. 

Gameplay is competent. It focuses on a simple system, very much inspired by games such as Dark Souls. Most encounters with opponents take the form of a mostly satisfying duel with a single opponent, and most of them demand you learn their behaviour and rhythm. Any encounter with more than one enemy at a time becomes a challenge, and dealing with it carefully and strategically becomes vital.

So, overall I give this game praise. However...

One flaw that is worth pointing out is that this game feels a bit derivative at times. While many of the ideas it presents are nice, good for VR and certainly fit the tone and world they've created, I get the impression that a some of these ideas were taken from somewhere else, at times haphazardly. It's baby's first Dark Souls, and it doesn't feel like they thought all of it through. One example is an entire 'level' that reminds me too much of the Twilight Realm from Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Maybe it's a tribute? 

Still, good game, and a great example of what VR can be.","May 11, 2018 at 4:29 AM",4, 12,

Shortcuts, ""bonfires"", some weaponsmithing-light, learn enemy attack patterns etc. You don't lose XP when you die, but you get one year older. And there are more (easy) puzzles to solve. 
Made very professionally, nice graphics, interesting setting and story. Some people complain about the VR experience, but I can't share this opinion.

The world is very well crafted and brings a unique puzzle aspect, both at a level that is still top tier for VR titles.

The tradeoff seems to be a much longer game as a result of minimal use of VR mechanics, which for what the game is as a whole, is fine with me.

But again, to me, the game is just boring as it's as barebones as it gets for this genre and comes off as a very ""indie"" title, which to me isn't a good thing. I got this at the launch of the Rift and I doubt I've played it more than a few hours, I try it again from time to time, but it's still the same title. Finally the asking price on this game is still extremely high - and in my opinion it's not worth it. BUT if you like this genre, if you're cool with a very barebones game, then this will do.

I want to explore this place as the character, not some disconnected player who just happens to be a fly on the wall. FAIL.
Maybe you get used to it over time, but so far I haven't. This plays like any other 2D game.

The dynamics of the game are very similar to Dark Souls (something really nice) and the environments are amazing, sometimes, the style of the designs, back to my mind some Ghibli's movies . The music is really beautiful. 

About the difficulty... well I think is quite acceptable. And regarding to the items, well, it would be great if you could have some armor or similar things (not too much because the simple things if they are good much better).

The history of the game is something that it could be much better. The main charapter is nobody, and there is no good backgrounds that support him. But maybe this is something that I see as a writer. I would do many changes to improve it.

I played this game on the default adventure mode and died over and over and over again. Each time you die, any doors you have opened remain opened and any items collected stay in your inventory, but all the enemies respawn. So a typical scenario is fighting your way to a location, being killed, then respawning at the last portal and fighting your way all the way back to that location, only to die again and then have to restart. You acrue experience as you win battles which you use to level up so the battles ultimately become easier, not because you have mastered the combat, but because your blows now do more damage and you have a larger health bar. It's tedious in the extreme. Every 10 years you get a stat boost so eventually after reaching 60 years old I just decided to see what happened if I kept dying and how old I could become. I purposefully threw myself of a ledge 20 times and was finally told I had reached immortality. This had the benefit of giving me some stat boosts making the game easier, my weapons did more damage and I had an even bigger health bar, but I still kept dying though, immortality didn't stop that. The best thing about the game was that the wizened, gnarled appearance of my near dead character avatar at 80 years pretty much represented how ravaged I felt having endured 10 or so hours of this tedium. There are puzzles, but not really. Anything in the game that you can pick up glows. You pick them up. Then you come to a door or mechanism that requires an object to work. You go to your inventory, you try each object in turn and one of them will open the door. No thought required. At all. To cap it off the ending was terrible rendering the whole thing meaningless. I've had the game a few weeks and played it to completion so I can't claim a refund.

Once you get a hang of the rhythm of it, it becomes a joy to fight in this game.

2022-05-28 14:27:25.996230,jhenrikb,almost a very good game. (bad mechanism),"This is very cool. However expect to die a lot because of bad mechanism design. Sometimes you get locked up in corners, unable to dodge or block and just dying. The ability to cancel movements like healing because you might get a hit, isnt there. Was very frustrating at times, espesially the big guys with stone sword and massive shield. The dodge + direction isnt also perfect either so a few times I ""dodge"" into the attack. 
Overall, fun. Would buy again :) 

I just hate ""un-cancellable"" actions that results in stupid scenarios. If you played Arma2 you know all about this. example if you want to stand up lying in grass while getting shot at, the character slowly stands up, takes up his rifle etc etc. Then when the Action scene is done loaded, you have taken 500 shots to the body and instantly dies. While the action happends there is just nothing you can do about it :)","Jul 2, 2017 at 8:30 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 14:27:41.869954,Chiara,"Spectacular art, comfy, but some issues","This game is the first of its kind in VR, a beautiful, third-person action/adventure RPG. Its unique choice to eschew locomotion and use a static camera not only makes it extremely comfortable but also enables its beautiful art by allowing each scene to have a range of elements at different depths and all of them at an appropriate level of detail. Its use of match cuts as you move from scene to scene prevents ever losing your character, and the worlds are carefully designed to embrace this constraint. My personal favorite art is the treehouses of the Pan, with delicate wooden bridges set amidst 500-foot trees with sunshine filtering through the canopy. The animation is no less perfect, with every walk, run, and climb revealing not the slightest flaw, even on staircases, which really helps keep you in the experience. And the use of scale, audio, and level design to create terrifying experiences like your first encounter with the Cyclops is unforgettable. █ The story and mechanics didn't click as well with me. No HUD is great for immersion, but without life meters, I fought the same battles over and over, never knowing if I had even come close to winning. And although you are given choices in designing and levelling up your character, they aren't meaningful. The strategy of levelling up strength/agility while you're young and arcane when you're older is obvious. Selecting strength vs. agility based on your preferred fighting style is a legitimate choice, but arcane feels useless, especially for boss battles, since it only provides a short, temporary buff and has a long cooldown. Many players also didn't realise the queen's scepter can be separated in the menu. █ Some parts of the story were fantastic - the magic mirror, the Dreamers, the princess, the Pan with riddles. But it left me with more questions than answers about the world. And like others, I feel like the ending was rushed and dissatisfactory. Overall: play it for the art, but I recommend casual mode!","Mar 21, 2017 at 11:44 AM",4, 3,

However quite unimpressed that this occurs and is the only app out of over a dozen I've used to have this issue. Especially disappointed that this from a game in the apparent 'best at launch' category.


Edit:
Disabling Surround in the Nvidia control panel, has fixed the crashes, then reenabling surround when finished. It's a hassle to reconfigure my monitors, bezel corrections and desktop  layout whenever I start the game. But it is a workable solution.

The game itself is beautiful, with decent mechanics, challenging combat (at least for me who doesn't play much hack and slash) and I find the third person perspective enjoyable and immersive. Loving the game and have updated the experience to show that. 



Without the full PC crashes on startup this would definitely be a 4/5 star game and one of the best vr experiences out there, in my opinion. Hopefully these technical issue can be fixed.

2022-05-28 14:27:45.028657,J_Trill,Hate Dark Souls? Play Difficulty CASUAL,"I was really iffy about this game because I hate Dark Souls combat and find the difficulty of those games mind-numbingly stupid. However, this game on CASUAL is very much like Dark Souls light. As you progress through the game there are many times you do a part maybe 15-30 minutes that will link back to your original checkpoint so you can get through it piece by piece without having to rekill enemies many times if you do actually die.

If you pick up Chronos and just want to enjoy a Zelda-Esque title this is your game. I like games more like God of War, but the combat still is rewarding once you find the weapon you prefer. I personally hate games that force you to dodge all of the time like Dark Souls, and this game doesn't require it in every battle. You will do it in some fights, but if you make a Strength build you can just block and nullify the damage when you get a little further in the game. I personally like this playstyle since I can just chill out and when their attack animation is done I can just wail on them.

This is drastically different from someone with an Agility build that gets faster dodging and builds up defense as well, who depends more on quickness/parrying. So if you prefer or like timing things perfectly then you will probably like that build.

In casual, you really don't die very much and when you do it isn't really a big deal. It can be annoying that you have to kill the enemies again, but I didn't really find myself dying all that much unless I got completely careless so that is very reminicent of Dark Souls, but realistically I've only truly died like 3-4 times on my casual playthrough and like 5 of them are just me half-paying attention and falling in a hole.

TLDR: If you don't like the difficulty of Dark Souls then play CASUAL instead of normal/heroic and you should like it. It's a great action adventure RPG in VR with great music/sounds to immerse you in.","Jun 26, 2017 at 3:27 PM",5, 2,

He won't aim his swings at enemy, he won't dexterously change from attacking to retreat, you'll get caught on an enemy behind you when you need to escape quickly, you will miss the hit and render yourself vulnerable if you aimed slightly off of enemy or you slightly did not reach the enemy with your weapon, when the enemy is right on the edge of the cliff and should fall already and you try to push him off you will fall with him because you was not able to get away from the edge because attack animation did not switch to roll soon enough. If you have a life and do not want to spend your time adapting to frustratingly unresponsive controls do not bother bying this.","Jan 4, 2017 at 11:08 PM",2, 4,

My first playthrough was rough, and I ended up finishing it at the tender age of 72. Here's a quick tip, don't start with a dodge-based character, start with a blocking based character. Dodging is far more punishing if you don't time it correctly and for your first playthrough you need all the help you can get. That said, I have found dodging more rewarding as far as damage is concerned, so when you feel comfortable with the game, switch to dodging with another character and let the adrenaline flow. I have now beaten the game 3 times and am about to start on my 4th. Best story-driven game I've found on the hands-down, I would dare say I think it's the best one on the store.","Jan 8, 2017 at 4:02 AM",5, 4,

Been playing it for about 5 or 6 hours now (on and off). This is one of those rare games that acually make me talk to myself out loud. The enviromnents are unbeliveable. And some of the things that the developers did left a huge impression on me, never before seen in a game. If I were to compare it, I would say a cross between a Zelda game and God of War, with some brand new ideas thrown in. The mechanics work great in VR, and I REALLY hope they continue this franchise.

It's cool and each scene has great depth.  Although I wouldn't mind IF it was possible to do a ""behind follow"" camera.  That'd be a nice option and make it a completely different game.

Basically it's the VR version of Dark Souls for now, but brighter, mildly easier, and filled with less nightmarish enemies. Those looking for a challenge will love this. Those of you who have played through Dark Souls will feel the simularities but not quite the challenge.
Everytime you die you age a year in game, and this contributes to your strength/dexterity/magic. Most people I've talked to who played through this say it took them about 10 hours or so and ended on the age 80+.
