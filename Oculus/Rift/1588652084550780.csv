The artstyle is perfect for the game setting, the shooting is fun and messy (you're not gonna land precision shots, it's a ""shoot all that moves"" type of game), your character and your gun will go back and forth with some hilarious banter through the whole experience, and the polish overall is quite visible.
A big applause to the voice acting which is absolutely great.
You can finish the game in about 1 hour of crazy shooting, but it's perfect to pick up every now and then for some mindless quick VR fun.","Aug 30, 2019 at 5:45 AM",5, 4,
