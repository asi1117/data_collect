2022-05-28 19:58:21.473070,EliXIrNInE,My First Review and I dont do reviews.,I have never wrote a review for any VR games until now. This game inspired me to write one with the goal of having more players in the community of Gurrah. THis game is great. Its amazing. Its fun. Its cool. its super effen sweet toatally rad best game ever so just get it and be like all the cool kids. That being said. Its difficult at first but dont let that stop you. Once you get good the reward is the journey you took on the path to being a great swordsman. or melee weapons specialist.. Lol. Seriousley. Your basically sword fighting like for real. Virtually. Its easy to win when you know what your doing and you oponent doesnt. Sword fighting is a martial art.  ART. Its and artistic form of combat and open to creativity and inginuity and rewards got to the most talented combatant that has earned their skill through training and study. The more you know about actual swordfighting the better you will be at this game.. Most of the time is you run into someone better than you. Just ask for a few pointers. Everyone is really respectful and the sence of honor and fair play is very much alive and well. There are a few jerks but they usually dont stay that way for long. No one will let them. So dont be afraid to let people know your new and maybe someone will train you. Before you fight someone you must touch swords to make it official. So like I said. The sense of honor in battle is alive and well and part of what makes this game fun. The community actually respects each other as players and go out of their way establish fairplay for a very enjoyable experience. See you in battle my friend. I challenge you to a duel.,"Apr 27, 2021 at 9:35 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:58:21.488030,MayhemThaKid,Could be amazing but,"First of all scimtars i dont know if thats how you spell it  are not for stabbing idc what you say, For balance in a video game they should not out range and out dmg spear users  also there is a clear meta from the start which stifles player growth in finding new ways to fight and be good ,Still also they are laser swords not laser whips. some weapons will power through yours as well  , def mode is easily abused and should break after so long . There is no match making and most rooms are people who know eachother and are jumping people or just general trolling . Rarely is a match played btw the best weapons are the axe the greatsword and the scimtar  , And leg sweeps with the greatsword do vastly to much dmg like i said its a clear meta you'll learn from the 1st room your in 
AND I GOTTA SAY for the cute dev who put the whole dont take a sword strike to the hand to get a CHEAP hit in your opening there , the irony in that is oustanding","Jan 31, 2021 at 2:49 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 19:58:21.518456,curtis.lear.5,One of the Best VR Games I've Played,"plays really well and I've had no problems, met the Dev and he is super nice. the idea behind the game is good because I play tons of other swordfighting games and I've always wanted something like this. Would reccomend this to any of my friends.","Dec 23, 2020 at 3:34 PM",5, 33,

The game is based around fighting other players using weapons that are made of some type of lazor. The game is unique in that it solved the problem of ""flailing"" meaning users swinging weapons extreamly fast to do damage. It does this by having weapons ""Break"" if they hit something. If it breaks on a player they take damage. the only way your weapon will not break is if it is in ""Defensive"" mode ( a mode that allows you to block and break weapons but do no damage). not all weapons have a defensive mode, but might have other ways to break opponents weapons. if your weapon breaks for any reason it regenerates in a short time (1-2 seconds) and your back in action.

TLDR: Fun game about combat against other players useing lightsaber-like weapons.

Cons:
Servers could be optimized a bit better.
Bit of a learning curve but fun to learn.","Dec 26, 2020 at 5:47 AM",4, 15,
2022-05-28 19:58:24.651183,Bionick69,its good,its good but the only thing that is bad are the settings i dont know how to save them and i cant hear people (idk if there is voice chat) i just need help with the settings.,"Mar 2, 2021 at 3:53 AM",4, 2,"Settings might have an issue that don't save on the first login, but end up saving. Additionally there is voice chat, check sound settings for Input/output to fix this! Let me know if you are having any other issues!"
2022-05-28 19:58:24.667141,Warlock_the_Wise,This game is Halo MP type of Addicting,"If you're on the fence about this game, don't be. After putting it down day 1, I walked away with a type of feeling about a game I hadn't had since Halo 3's multi-player. The weapons are awesome and I love the versatility.  Wrap things up with a cool community and you have yourself an easy purchase!","Jan 5, 2021 at 7:22 AM",5, 5,
