2022-05-28 18:44:22.491428,andyphillips99,Overall pretty good AND,"It's important to buy/fund apps like this, so that creators can continue to push the limits.  Even if you're a VR veteran (like myself) you'll look at the motion capture techniques used in this (to capture a real performance) and be awed. Even after getting used to the character animations in Alyx nothing can prepare you for seeing a truly human performance in VR.  It's a little rough around the edges but a true glimse into the future of the VR movie medium.","Jul 3, 2020 at 4:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:44:22.505390,andre.mik,Stunning and Beautiful!,"One of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in VR.  The music, lighting and acting were fantastic!  The reason I would not give this 5 stars however is because of two reasons: 1. The whole experience is only about 10 mins long and 2. There is very little one can do besides watching it all.  A click here and there is all that is required.  I was hoping for something that was more like a game but it is more of a short movie.  Still a very immersive experience and I can't wait for the next part to be released!","Jun 27, 2020 at 8:51 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:44:22.520350,DreamerO,Absolutely Stunning!!,"This should be the benchmark of future cinematic VR. The acting was incredible, the music was perfect, and the immersion is unreal. Looking forward to Episode 2 already!","May 31, 2020 at 5:27 AM",5, 8,Thanks for your feedback DreamerO. Glad to know you enjoyed it and your kind words are much appreciated.
2022-05-28 18:44:22.536308,sjvickers,Not worth the price,"Too short and very limited activty or interaction. For £5.99, the expectations were higher. Would like to think Episode 2 would be discounted or free if you have bought Episode 1, based on this.","Jun 2, 2020 at 3:49 AM",2, 4,Thanks for your feedback sjvickers and we will take all of this into consideration
2022-05-28 18:44:22.551268,tkansal,Well done but short,"It is more like a demo.
10 minutes 
Maybe worth 2 bucks.","Jun 2, 2020 at 2:52 AM",3, 3,Thanks for your interest in the project and for your feedback.
2022-05-28 18:44:25.655964,profmjg787,"Interesting, but ...","Was interesting, but not interesting enough to bring me back for more.  Pretty short, but great graphics and well presented.   Worth a try if you like dramatic movies.  Not much to do but sit and watch.","Jun 7, 2020 at 4:18 AM",3, 0,Thanks for the review profmjg787 and appreciate your feedback
