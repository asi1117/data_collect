2022-05-28 20:43:14.630501,SternwardBox20,This game is really fun,I find this game very fun and I play it a lot but I beat the hardest difficulty first try so I would like a harder one and I would like a way to see all of your plays at once instead of having to cycle through trying to find which one you want.

2022-05-28 20:43:14.646458,Slick1984,UPDATED REVIEW,"UPDATE: I was away for a while (from this game) and saw that there were some updates recently, so I thought that I would see what was done. There are a few different levels of difficulty added. With each level up in difficulty, the ""player's"" appearence also levels up. From a single wheel bot to a grown human player.

You can now practice kicking Field Goals (although, I didn't check that out, yet). Practice as a Receiver and other things like Quaterback Challenge.

What I'm getting at is that the amount of content increased dramatically. It's not just the ol' 2MD Football anymore. And the receivers now catch the ball!",Apr 19 at 4:54 AM,5, 0,"Hey Slick1984! We're glad you're enjoying the update! we've got another big one in the pipeline, so stay tuned!"
2022-05-28 20:43:14.661418,Et3ho,"Was great, is good.","Dev response made me want to change my rating from three to five stars cause besides the issues below I do really like the game. I think I'm just not as good as I thought I was lol.

My biggest concern, and why this game is only getting a 3 star from me for now, is how much it feels like the mechanics have changed with the QB and full CPU WR interactions. I feel like they made it a lot more difficult to hit throws that I used to have no problem doing before the most recent update. A lot of passes that I (fairly) easily made and I don't feel like I'm throwing them any differently than I used to just get intercepted.

I don't know if they made the changes to balance out how powerful the manual receiving is now, but if they can't make the tuning different for CPU and fully anual receivers than idk how I'm supposed to have fun playing a game I used to love playing anymore.

Edit:
First off: I noticed while playing and paying more attention to the CB-WR interations downfield, there's no more engaging while the ball is in the air like they used to. The DB and WR used to move around and bounce off eachother a bit, almost like they're fighting for positioning on the football field to catch the ball. Now it feels like if you underthrow it by even the smallest amount the DB will just kind of get into position, push the WR away and stand there until the ball hits them and pick it off with no fighting back from the WR.

The other thing is that it feels like defenders will literally catch anything that touches them for the most part now, almost like recievers. Before, a lot of balls that I'd throw would just bounce off the DB and either hit the WR or fall incomplete. I don't feel like there's any room for error anymore is because it feels like if I'm just the tiniest bit off the DB will always intercept the pass with no chance for my reciever. I know I'm probably over exaggerating but its gotten to the point where I overthrow WRs a lot cause I'm too worried to throw a pick.",Feb 16 at 12:42 PM,5, 2,"Hey there.  So, there have been *no* changes made to any of the mechanics you described, so strange as it may sound, that's all your perception.  The 1.5 update added the manual receiver mode as described, but there were no changes to the AI behavior for standard and assisted modes.

Previously, on occasion a bug in the offensive AI would cause receivers to deviate from their route and block defenders.  This bug was fixed in 1.42 . 

Beyond that, the defenders behavior with regards to interceptions have not been changed since the initial 1.0 release.  Earlier rounds will exhibit the behavior you described, with the ball more often bouncing off defenders, while later rounds they are better at intercepting.

So! sorry to see you didn't like our game.  If in the course of playing you change your mind, feel free to update your review again!"
2022-05-28 20:43:14.677376,Coolliek27,Its amazing!,"This game is absolutley...
AMAZING!
Just look at it, it has a catching ability even though its a qb arcade format game, and also You can literally posses a wr, and you can be lamar jackson and stiff arm people to their misery while running the ball! Just two things are missing to make the ultimate game.
1. kind of like what mvvlf said on twitter, it needs a option where the camera angle can be changed from a first-person view to a broadcast, like what evolution has for example.
Just Imagine pulling a OBJ on dummies while being on camera like a nfl player?! Thats sick..
2. Defense. 

This is optional since this isnt a simulation type game.
But hitsticking dummies and intercepting would be so cool!


Other than that this game is like madden in vr, except Better!
(Yeah I said it EA sports, what you gonna do, charge me money?)
Its so much better.
Keep up the good work Truant Pixel, LLC.",Feb 12 at 11:37 AM,5, 1,"Hey Coolliek27!  Thanks for the kind word.  We have plans to increase the options as we refine the new mode, so stay tuned!"
2022-05-28 20:43:14.691338,TintedIsHereVR,UPDATE: I fixed it,"I cannot use the right joystick to turn, only move, and I cannot turn any other way besides turning in real life, which leads to another problem. When I turn in real life, the way I am running does not adjust, which screws me up horribly. Say I turn into manual QB and throw the ball, I am using the facing catch to catch the ball, but when I turn around to runl, I have to use the joystick to run backwards to go fowards (if that makes sense). Also, I screwed something up with the input afterwards to try to fix the problem, but I couldn't reset it, I had the one input set as escape when I tried exiting. If you guys could help by responding to this, I would really love that by all means. Anyways, great game, everything else feels great, just please help me with this issue. I don't understand what's going on, I tried deleting the game and 2MD_data folder and re-installing it hoping it would reset everything, but it didn't. Everything stayed the same.",16 days ago,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:43:17.832936,LathX,Good but needs some things.,"I really like this game it's the best VR football game out there BUT it has 2-3 major issues.
1.) When the ball is thrown (feels like every crucial throw) the WR just kinda stops running and blocks the defender OR vice versa the the DB just shoves the WR and ends up getting picked.
2.) Add penaltys so things like this can stop happening and oblivously a full game like offense and defense control would be awesome but this game is still young and has tons of time to develop.
3.) I feel like instead having to like hit the reciever dead on is a little unrealistic cause there is times where in reality it would be such an easy catch if you just stuck your hands out. 

P.S I really appreciate anyone who reads this like I said I love this game but just needs a few fixes to really bring it to the 5 star.",Jan 13 at 10:50 AM,4, 2,"Hey there!

We've got some updates coming that should address your concerns with the WR.  Also, you absolutely can lead your throws (you don't have to hit the receiver dead on) you just have to be sure the defensive coverage isn't going to crush them.

This might sound funny, but - if you think it's a 5 star game, please rate it as such.  holding it back doesn't help us, and as you can tell, we read and respond to every review regardless :)"
2022-05-28 20:43:17.847895,william.rosenbaum.24,One of the best games there is.,This game is amazing. It is the best football game on the market right now and a huge bang for your buck.

2022-05-28 20:43:17.863853,Baljit693,GAME,"this game is really fun and cant stop playing it there are only 2-3 things i have a prob with 

1.sometimes the WR will start garding the defender insted of catching the ball he would be open but wont catch it and start defending the cb 

2.when i throw the ball deep its not really a 1 on 1 anymore because every cb goes and tries to get the ball and most of the time lead to a int 

3.this is a rare thing that happens to me but still happens sometimes i would throw the ball like i normally do but it would glitch and throw to the ground insted of the wr im throwing to

Other then that it a really fun game 

suggestions:

1.maybe add a upgrade thing to the wr and o line so i can upgrade there speed,catching,route running,and so on 

2.then add a upgrade thing to the qb mainly speed cuz the D line is way faster then me leading to me not going far with the ball and or losing yards


3.make RB faster then the rest or make him more aware cuz most of the time he will just run into the o line and not going far 

4.if u can make online a thing

5. also if u can make the player have a say inf Defence",Jan 9 at 10:52 AM,4, 1,"Hey There!  Thanks for the review, we have some updates on the way soon that should address some of the concerns you have, so stay tuned!"
2022-05-28 20:43:17.878813,firemanlive,"Fun, But Not A “Full Game”... yet","I purchased 2MD to check out the “Full game exhibition mode” update.

It’s fun, but still not a full game because there is no way to play defense.

When the opposing team gets a turnover, the game just randomly generates an outcome (punt, field goal, or touchdown) 

So I’d like to see the devs add defense in exhibition mode. 
Ideally, playing defense would allow the player to sack the QB, tackle receivers and catch interceptions. 

Also, a PvP update would make the game much more fun and re-playable.",Nov 14 at 2:34 PM,4, 10,"Hey firemanlive,
Firstly, thanks for the kind review and for taking the time to rate our game!  I feel it's important to clarify something, though -- ""full game"" refers to the game length, not playing defense. 

2MD was originally designed as a 2-minute drill QB arcade game, but as you can see we've been slowly adding more options for players to expand their experience.  We've created exhibition mode to provide a more complete experience (and let players contend with the results of a successful offensive drive as part of their strategy.) .  This turned out to be an excellent way to incorporate an opposing drive without grinding the flow of gameplay to a halt.

One key issue that comes up is, even if defense were playable, how can we make it ""fun?"" more importantly, it would have to be AS fun as playing Quarterback -- this is a tall order, not necessarily taking into account the need to basically invent a functional defensive gameplay mechanic for VR.  We're not saying it's impossible, mind you, rather it's just not as easy as some folks seem to suggest.  Being able to run out onto a field, turn on a dime and track a ball thrown to one of multiple receivers in world-space around you is not a small order by any stretch, and has the potential to quickly become a dull or even frustrating experience for a player.  Either that, or the mechanics have to be so tilted in the player's favor they basically reduce the challenge to nothing.

As I said, I'm not at all saying these things aren't possible -- just not simple; indeed, the reason you haven't seen them YET is we haven't cracked the code to implement them in a way that is fun, and at the same time not ridiculously complex.  that being said, keep an eye out on the updates that are coming, as we are still working to further round out 2MD's football experience.  I hope that sheds a little light on the issue, and again, thanks for taking the time to play our game and come to my TED talk!"
2022-05-28 20:43:17.894770,Grink22,My favorite VR experience,"An incredibly fun and addicting masterpiece. I have about 37 hours total and every hour is just as exciting as the last. 

Throwing feels absolutely amazing. It’s not too easy, or too difficult. You’re truly rewarded for making accurate throws and penalized for bad ones. You can feel how momentum affects each throw. Running forwards seems to give you some more arm strength, and throwing off your back foot or sideways is more challenging. For a VR football game you’d think throwing would be a bit clunky, but the word smooth seems to come to mind when thinking of how the passing aspect of the game plays.
I don’t think there’s actually anything negative I can say, the only negative aspect of passing is that sometimes throws don’t register and fall to the ground like they were batted. Though that’s an Oculus sensor issue and not a game issue. 
Similarly, running and the entire movement altogether feels great. Learning how to stiff arm and where it’s best to Derrick Henry a defender into the turf creates so much hype on every play of the game. 
Receiver control just shoves this game over the edge. Screens and checkdowns became so much more viable and when playing on higher difficulties they become your lifeline. Being able to catch a short ball in the flat and stiff arming your way up the field is such an amazing feature. A+++ to you guys.
Exhibition mode has turned me into an absolute addict. I find myself running game after game on different difficulties hours at a time. However unrealistic it may be, I hope that one day a full franchise mode of sorts can come out of this mode : game.
The addition of rosters and attributes for each team really fleshes out the customization, and makes each team come to life. 
My only suggestions are quality of life suggestions, as I have no real complaints with the game:
1. Full box score after each game with receivers statistics (for stat tracking dweebs like me who play exhibition)
2. Addition of play design numbers (1,2,3,left T and right T) to the roster sheet so you can create plays to your players attribute strengths without having to figure those numbers out
3. Customization of rosters (name / number customization) with QB number selection
4. More layers to uniform customization (removal of helmet stripe, separate coloring of different parts)
5. Basic customization of opponent for exhibition (team / jersey colors so you aren’t playing against the same team over and over)
6. Addition of timeouts to exhibition games

In conclusion, if you’re looking for the most realistic (in my opinion) football QB game look no further. Truant has created a masterpiece with endless fun awaiting you. Thank you and happy holidays to you Truant <3",Dec 30 at 6:50 PM,5, 1,"Hey Grink22!

I just got into VR last week and this is by far the best value for the money I have spent. The options to fine tune mechanics and ability to draw your own plays with some humor mixed in makes this a must have VR game, top to bottom.  I have not even tried the reciver mode yet and I am amazed at the depth of this game so far.

Doesn't the old saying go, ""the best defense is a good offence?""

wait . . .wait it isn't?  er.  then that's what it should be!

Passes, handoffs, run plays, stiff arms, drawing up original plays...it's all in this VR game! I have even experimented with play-action to see if the AI would be thrown off. It seems to be effective. If console-type graphics is your go-to rating, then 2MD may not make the top 10.

But I would like the scrambling part of it to be better and easier. Your player is way to slow I think and when I'm running the offensive line really isn't so good. Also when you pass the line the defense feels like they get way faster than before. So the game is fun and good, but the scrambling part of it needs to better by using the things I just suggested. Also it's more of a 3 1/2 star not a 3 star.","Mar 2, 2021 at 2:56 AM",3, 5,"Hey Tomyy31, thanks for the feedback -  We hope you're enjoying all the updates we've made, which included making running / rushing / scrambling easier.  more is on the way too!"
2022-05-28 20:43:27.342501,redgle123,Impossible to Win,"Especially with this new update, even if you can survive the guantlet to round 7, during the championship your o line is made of paper and you get sacked withing a single second. Also, defenders can push your receivers away to get interceptions without consequences. Unless I'm the QB for the Bengals, this game is definitely not simulation football. Only thing that keeps me from 1 starring it is due to the throwing motion being really accurate. Needs a lot of work.","Nov 3, 2020 at 11:16 AM",2, 6,"Hey Redgle123, your review hit one point correctly - 2MD is NOT simulation football.  It appears your expectations are not really in line with the game we're selling, which is an arcade experience meant to be enjoyed in short bursts.  I'd humbly suggest you re-align your perspective a bit.  2MD is to simulation football what NBA Jam is to basketball: a very pared-down experience based on a limited ruleset with tightly focused gameplay. That being said, if you're getting clobbered in the 7th round, it means you need to switch up your strategy, because a shotgun arm isn't going to win you the championship.  I'd encourage you to look in the community or on youtube to see what kind of plays people have come up with, to give you a better idea of how to approach the (very) challenging final rounds.  Our analytics also tell us that a significant number of folks have beaten the game, so I can assure you that 'impossible to win' doesn't really hold true either :)"

The only issue I have with it is that when you beat round 7, there is no hoopla, it is very ho-hum and nothing exciting happens. Also, when you beat level 7, you get a ring. I would like to see a new ring for every time you beat level 7. I should 
have 5 now. LOL

2022-05-28 20:43:27.374415,xkurama47,needs improvement.,"every single time a new game starts, my first 2-3 plays are always extremely choppy. I don't know why this happens but my frames get cut in half basically and the power of my throw is significantly lower than normal, resulting in me botching the pass. I have a PC that is above the recommended specs, and I am capped at 72 hz due to Oculus link so I doubt it is a hardware issue on my end.

Passing: I was never a QB so idk if I just suck but I feel like I still haven't found a rhythm for passing yet. It feels pretty awful. I am usually either throwing way too soft, or bombing it. Can't find a ""sweetspot"" to consistently get the ball to my targets. I honestly feel like it is pretty unbelievably hard to throw to a target in this game which just straight up takes the fun out of it.

the lack of gameplay and annoying throwing makes this a 2 star game. having to go through all waves of teams every single time i want to play is frustrating at this point, considering the waves get extremely difficult after a while. Just adding a basic scrimmage mode where we can pick teams would be a fantastic addition. 

It is an okay game, but lacks replay value due to the single game mode, and is giving me performance issues with a Upper-Mid tier PC.","Sep 17, 2020 at 11:21 AM",2, 0,"Hi Xkurama47.  I can't exactly speak to why you're experiencing what you're experiencing, because the game was developed with the Rift and Rift-S in mind, Oculus Link is not a certification that we've put the game through, as it was not available to us when we developed the game and we focused instead on a *dedicated* Quest version, which limits concerns about things like lag creating incorrect behavior for your throws.  The reason you can't find a 'sweet spot' is likely due to the fact that even the fast connection of the link introduces perceptible delays into the positional and physics calculations, and trying to accurately hit a dime on an RB 40 yards downfield becomes extremely difficult because of that additional millisecond lag in responsiveness.

When you purchased the game, you were automatically granted a Quest version in your library thanks to crossbuy, which we've supported since day 1.  Ideally that's the way to go in this circumstance, as it will provide you the best possible performance for the platform.

If, however, you still want to use the game on your PC through Oculus link, my FIRST recommendation would be to adjust the quality settings for the game, as even though you have a 'mid tier' PC, such distinctions are extremely fluid and really don't apply well to VR software.  I'd recommend first selecting a quality mode that does not utilize broadcast settings, as that is potentially what may be causing your GPU to choke.  Secondly, you should make sure your CPU isn't limiting the experience either, as 2MD is heavily physics based and if you're on an older platform that could still cause problems even if your GPU is up to par.   

All that being said, it still may not give you as good an experience as a Rift or Rift S.  Try the Quest version, I think it'll give you a much better experience if either of those dedicated PC VR headsets are not available to you."
2022-05-28 20:43:27.390373,taquitobuddy,"Solid base, but needs more","This is a football mini-game, about the same amount of content as the football game in VR sport challenge, which I'd have to recommend over this.  For $15 you get about an hour of content, maybe 2 if you want to try lots of different plays.  What is here is good, but it just needs more.  My suggestions:

1) Add VR Sport Challenge-style receiving.  Receiving is a must, worries about people turning around and falling over or whatever don't change that.

2) Remove the throw through rings game at the end of every touchdown or make it optional.  Gets boring extremely fast and adds nothing to the football.

3) This DESPERATELY needs variety in the main game - make a game four 2-minute quarters and have interceptions and turnovers have a % chance to result in the opponent's scoring.  No more 6/13/etc. points for the opponents every single game.  

4) Give the teams/players some very basic stats to differentiate them.  Make some players faster, more likely to break tackles, better catchers, etc.  

5) Bonus - add a tournament mode where you play with all the suggestions above for the best record that season ending with a final championship game.

I realize its a small team, but all of this should be doable because obviously the devs are talented programmers based on what is already in the game.  Add these things and call it ""Full Mode DLC"" for an additional $15, that's fine.  $30-50 for the game I'm describing would be a great value, the FIRST AND ONLY good VR football game.  100% monopoly.  Right now this is a decent mini-game but nothing more, and VR Sports challenge already did it as well or better.","Jan 10, 2020 at 12:28 PM",3, 41,"Hi AnnatarRedeemed,

2022-05-28 20:43:30.518008,Vido27,Must have!,"I bought this game and played through and  while there is no season mode and you cant build your team like a Madden franchise, the constant 2 minute drill is very fun. I've played this almost everyday since purchasing and would highly recommend for anyone who is a football fan. 

One change I would love to see is the ability to ""practice"" against any team, so I can get better against the later defenses without having to play all of the first 4-5 teams. 

Long term I would love to see a backyard football choosing players and having seasons, but for now this game is the best arcade version of football for VR and the replay value is extremely high.","Jan 19, 2020 at 10:44 PM",5, 6,"Thanks for the kind words, Vido27!  We hope you enjoy all the updates, we're looking at adding more content as we're able!"
2022-05-28 20:43:30.533965,VCRRepairman,One of my all time favorite VR games,"This is a VR classic in my mind.  I love this game, I've owned it on Steam, PSVR, Quest, and Rift.  

The Rift and Quest versions appear to be the same in my opinion (they're all very close) minus the expected visual differences so this review applies to both.

The throwing mechanics are nearly spot on.  You do have to play around with the calibration to get it as you want.  I originally had the power too high and felt that I was overthrowing everything.  I like having it closer to my real life capabilities so I turned it down and it almost feels like a passing simulator.  The receivers are sometimes dumb and will stop on routes, which is why you want to draw your plays (yes you can customize them) to have routes that carry on the full way.  They won't just keep going in that direction, instead they run downfield on a fly route.

The AI is difficult and you actually have to pay attention presnap to where the linebackers and safeties are.  If you see a corner playing off your receiver, perhaps you run a quick pass to pickup five or six yards or if you see a linebacker blitzing maybe you throw it into the gap where they were.  There is actually some strategy to it.

I will say the AI can appear to be cheap at times in later levels which requires me to run a few plays that are questionable (we're talking about picks on the DB's or linebackers to open a receiver up).  That though does feel a bit like the strategy of the game but I wish it wasn't quite so unbalanced.

All in all this is a great game and my favorite sports game in VR.  I'd love to see this expanded on in the future.","Jan 17, 2020 at 10:09 PM",5, 4,"Thanks for the kind words, and for taking the time to write a review!  More updates are definitely on the way, and we hope you're enjoying all the additions thus far!"
2022-05-28 20:43:30.549922,L0NGH0RNS77,"Great, but could use some tweaks","I love this game, but would love to see some things added for a better experience and more fun!
Id love to see a playbook on the wrist if you flip it. It’s hard to see the plays in first person and I don’t always remember what I drew for which 8 options. 
Running could also be a little better. The defense seems extremely fast compared to me and I can’t really run from them or scramble much. I’d also enjoy a RB option so I could run the ball more than just throwing it. Overall, it’s great, though!","Jan 14, 2020 at 1:56 PM",4, 4,"Hey LongHorns!  thanks for the kind words, we hope you get the chance to try out the updated game with ALLLLLL the additions we've been adding!"
2022-05-28 20:43:30.565879,Megalodon360,Great game with Potential,"Had a blast playing 2MD Football. It is an amazing QB 2 minute drill simulator with a spash of arcade fun between games and the customization of plays is great. 

Pros: 
Good Controls
Fun Gameplay
Custom Plays 
Leaderboards

Cons:
No Multiplayer or Coop Play
Would love more then 2 minute drill, full games or even abbreviated game like 5 min Quarters and Defensive Play. Season Stats and League Play!

All in all has a ton of potential and if it does well I hope to either see updates to this or a new Game with more features as that is the only thing holding it back now is lack of depth! Would Highly Reccomend at the price and even with the lack of content the leaderboards will keep you coming back for more!","Jan 14, 2020 at 6:16 AM",5, 4,Thanks for the kind words!

While we can't announce anything right now, we definitely have our own little wish-list of things we'd like to see, but as with all things it depends upon the response the game gets from you kind folks.
