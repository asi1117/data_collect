2022-05-28 20:08:14.338416,SensoNoOkami,It's good! (If you're good),"I absolutely love this game. Shooting feels good, it's pretty to look at, they nailed everything you'd want in a fast paced zombie shooter. But oh boy is this game NOT for casual players. Unless you're constantly on a personal best the characters talk a LOT of trash, it was enough to turn my boyfriend completely off the game, and he wasn't even doing bad. A way to turn character commentary off would be a nice addition.","Jul 1, 2021 at 7:24 AM",4, 3,"Thanks for the review!

If the character commentary isn't to your liking, you can turn them off in settings.

Pause > options > audio > voice over volume > set to 0%

In addition, checkpoint dialogues now cease if the player is more than 4 seconds behind the current PB (reverting to dialogue which doesn't insult the player!)

We implemented this mostly for people doing TP runs and the like, so they don't get insulted during sessions when they're not actively going for the best times.

Hope that helps!"

2022-05-28 20:08:14.369333,Nnnoodle,Not just another gimick,"I've played a few hours of this game now and have had nothing but fun. Exciting gameplay which does a great job of utilising the double headshot mechanic and executing on the VRFPS genre. The guns feel amazing and the competitive speedrun nature of the game adds lots replayability. Would thoroughly recommend giving it a try if you're a fan of Time Crisis, Superhot, Left 4 Dead or any other games like this.","Mar 26, 2021 at 4:45 AM",5, 16,Thanks for awesome review! Glad you're enjoying it.
