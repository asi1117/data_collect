Good value for money however, as is a large Mocha. It's a nice example of what you can do learning VR in Unity so well done for that. After so many deepy immersive high budget games that cost 10 times this, I am still left feeling this is short of 1/10th the value for money.","Jun 27, 2021 at 7:14 PM",2, 14,Thank you for your valuable feedback.
