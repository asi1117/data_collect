2022-05-28 19:41:58.553161,Kid Sniffa,"Horrible, Do Not Buy","Game seems unfinished, there is no HUD and no way of knowing when you are close to the border of the map until you run imto the invisible wall. Character can apparently only jog for 3 seconds then need to catch their breath. The only reaon i bought the game is becaue they stole the Severog charafter from Paragon. Do not buy this game. You willregret it. I played it once and theres no instructions no compass or any gps or anything so no way of knowing where the phones could possibly be until you get super close to them, i played nearly 45 minutes and couldnt find the last phone for the life of me. Do Not Buy!! youre welcome for saving you 12 bucks!","Jan 20, 2019 at 9:41 AM",1, 12,"We are really sorry to hear that.
