My Initial Impressions:
Having played quite a lot of Table Soccer in real life. I can tell you that the ball physics are spot on but the interactions on the table still need a lot of work, the ball was randomly moving with the slightest touch.
As a result I could not play the game as I would in real life.","Jul 13, 2020 at 11:06 PM",3, 7,"Hi ParadiseDecay. Thanks for doing that complete video review. I'm working on fixing those things and adding more features. They are known bugs, although I have been surprised by the ease with which some of them occur. So thank you."
2022-05-28 20:37:20.899604,MetaYannik,Nice game with potential to more,I really like this game already. I would maybe suggest to give the ball more weight. I know its hard for indie-developers to start and thats why im giving 5 stars for a better rating. Im looking forward to this project. Everybody is welcome to join the Discord Fan Server i created for this game to arrange playtimes and events. https://discord.gg/jcxJ3J6,"Jul 9, 2020 at 9:40 PM",5, 3,Thank you for your words BW90_Yannik. We think your initiative to create a Discord Server is great. We're working on improvements in physics and other topics. We also plan to add more features. We're glad you liked the game.
