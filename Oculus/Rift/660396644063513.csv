2022-05-28 15:31:48.889554,bitraider,Its ok.,For a shooter it has some high action moments. But zipping around from one stationary point to another is a bit constraining.,"Jun 10, 2020 at 6:10 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 15:31:48.933437,jac,Needs touch.,"When it launched, it was great, it gave us some kind of high quality VR shooter at a time without one. Now, it really needs touch support to stay relevant. Just simple aiming and shooting as an option, which shouldn't be too hard.","May 20, 2018 at 2:05 AM",3, 90,
2022-05-28 15:31:48.947399,Veraxus,Lack of Touch kills this,"Damaged Core looks good, runs great, and has a lot of really cool ideas. As one of the earlier VR titles (like The Climb) it also APPEARS to have been designed with Touch in mind... HOWEVER it doesn't actually support Touch. Unfortunately, this is a gamepad-only title with head aiming, and it utterly ruins the game. If Oculus Studios ever updates this with true Touch support, it will be a real showcase title for VR... but as-is, I cannot recommend it at all at any price. Touch is integral to any first-person VR experience, and there is no going back.","May 6, 2018 at 1:00 AM",1, 106,
2022-05-28 15:31:52.096976,nurocept,really needs touch support,"I know this doesn't support touch and I should review based on what it is, but I can't, I feel this could really be a touch supported game.

2022-05-28 15:31:52.111936,akerka92,Needs Touch support badly,The game is visually okay and I would give it 4 stars easily if it had Touch support. aiming with your head boring.

2022-05-28 15:31:52.126896,KhanCity,"Great use of locomotion, polished game","I dont know why people dislike this game, its polished, uses different movement style, and has a descent story.  For anyone thats that says its boring, I don't know which game you're playing.  For those who are complaining about locomotion should have done their research in the first place.  It tells you there's no support for touch controllers and that you transport your AI to different bodies for movement.  Plus, I got this game for $10, worth every penny.  There are few audio bugs at the end level cut scenes, but nothing thats a deal breaker.","Jan 5, 2018 at 12:05 AM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 15:31:52.156816,Art_Team21Studio,"Not very fun, gets boring quick","This doesn't bring anything new to the table except an excuse to keep the player standing in place. You just teleport from one body to another, there isn't anything really to experience here, this is a $10 experience at best. Though I would have felt ripped off at $10 to be honest.","Sep 21, 2017 at 4:57 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:31:55.268493,Eulenauge66,Stupidly difficult,"The basic idea - taking over machines by teleporting into them, being a kind of virus yourself - is great. The problem is, that I don´t even make the first level (protecting the drop ship). I am used to difficult games but this is beyond me. Why is it so hard to create a smooth learning curve? Only buy it if your frustration resistance is really high and you´re into stressful shooters without a break.","Aug 7, 2017 at 5:55 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 15:31:55.283453,captainbubby,"A great, ""Early VR"" title.","No doubt, this title was designed to showcase VR to an audience of early-adopters. Here is a title released at a time when:

* The locomotion issue/debate was still ongoing (and it still kind of is!)
* The Oculus Touch was not out, nor was it coming out for some time
* The Rift could not deliver a room-scale experience

Thus, here we have a game that is designed around these hurdles and ideosyncracies of early VR. 

Given that you play a rogue A.I., who can hack and take control of various droids and vehicles at will, with the caveat that you can only aim; not move, this nullifies early VR problems one and three: locomotion / movement

Given that all the aiming is done with your head, this nullifies problem number two: lack of tracked controllers. 

The touch controls, don't really add anything to the game, which plays fine with head aiming and the Xbone controllers.

One more item of note: The game is rated 18+, which baffles me. Star Wars is more violent. No F-bombs, no gore, no gratuitious nudity. It's not even PG-13 level violence. Why this is rated 18+ is really beyond me.","Jul 10, 2017 at 2:33 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:31:55.298413,WolfCam02,wtf,You don't say it supports touch if it doesn't support touch. Why are people rating this game good? The gameplay is awful. All you do is infect robots that deny you the ability to move and you shoot stuff with them. This is trash. Who cares if it has good graphics if the game isnt fun.,"Jun 28, 2017 at 9:14 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 15:31:55.313373,stephen.bryant.5817,Can't stand it,"In my opinion, this was the absolute worst idea for locomotion in a game, ever conceived.  You can't move.  All you can do is turn, shoot, and then blip to another character.  And when you die, you have to start whatever scene you're playing from the beginning.  ""Frustrating"" doesn't even begin to describe it.  I was using curse words I didn't even know that I knew.","Jul 21, 2017 at 7:24 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 15:31:55.328333,Shon_t,Not that great,"Not sure why there are so many positive reviews. I bought this game and only played for a few minutes until I got bored.

2022-05-28 15:31:58.459957,Jarten,"Fun to play, awesome visuals",When I got this game it was currently the best VR game in terms of visuals that I had tried out thus far. The gameplay is pretty solid and it definitly keeps you moving and turning quickly in order to survive. If anything my main complaint is that it doesn't have the option to make use of the Oculus Touch controllers. I think it would greatly improve on the overall immersion feel for when you are in control of a robot that has a gun if you were able to.,"Apr 29, 2017 at 6:19 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:31:58.474917,EditCrazy,Please Add Touch Aiming,"I bought this awhile back and, although it looks like a great game, head aiming makes me sick after 5-10 minutes.

2022-05-28 15:32:04.810970,teq,,"Very good game, however it should get touch support to really shine. Staring at things to shoot at them is just not so great, they can leave the stare in order to jump to a different host, but shooting should be decoupled if touch controllers are present.

Storyline is ok and keeps you entertained but I did find the final levels repetetive and the final bossfight was confusing and boring at the same time.","Jan 20, 2017 at 6:43 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:32:07.910679,Greyhawk101,Too hard!,"Game is stupidly hard right from the outset. Also, disappointingly all the action takes place while you are stood still - making it little more than a fancy version of that old tin can alley shooting game you used to play in 1975 in the local arcade.

2022-05-28 15:32:07.940600,passingoutnails,Almost perfect...,Really engaging and fun game with controller. I found playing it from a spinning computer chair to be one of the best VR experiences I've had. Would like to see touch support but with as much spinning as is necessary to be competitive at this game I would think you would need 3 trackers/room scale tracking to make it work well. This game would be difficult using 2 trackers and touch because of the frequent need to turn completely around. The controller not needing to be tracked and the great head tracking make it effortless.,"Dec 30, 2016 at 1:25 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 15:32:11.141039,foulplay,A lot of fun,"This game isn't groundbreaking, however it is a very well made VR FPS with some decent gameplay elements and strategies.

The teleportation mechanic is woven into the story and the gameplay so ""locomotion purists"" won't have to complain.

The hacking mechanic is not only for locomotion and tactical placement, but it also extends to other parts of the game, one mission has something firing rockets at you - hacking the rockets lets you send them back at the enemy for some satisfying payback.

Really enjoying this so far.","Nov 16, 2016 at 2:45 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:32:11.155999,YmpulsiV-O,A Must Have for Sci-Fi FPS Lovers,"Okay! When I first saw this and read the 'story' behind what to expect in play, I was a bit skekptical.  However, the graphics really reeled me in, as I am an artist myself. Very top notch!
The whole concept from start to finish was very well thought out and craftily put together. The in-game physics felt realistic and natural. The movement of the characters was fluid. The visual effects were memorable, especially when receiving updates and exiting through the camera.
I especially liked the ability to jump from host to host enabling multiple perspectives of a scene. ""Shoot them! Possess them! And, get out before its too late!"" Really nice.
My only gripes were that the gameplay was short and there's only one difficulty level, making it quite predictable on subsequent plays.
Other than those two points, I think the game is very well made and enjoyable. Maybe the short gameplay is a plus... to reduce eye-fatigue. This was my first VR/FPS and I'd have no hesitation recommending to anyone.
I'm looking forward to Damaged Core II... or other games like this one.

The premise of why you can teleport is pretty awesome, being a virus infecting other robots minds. Getting a lot of Matrix being an Agent!


One thing i must stress is this game must be played standing, I don't know why the developer didn't put a pop-up at the beginning recommending it, being able to quickly turn your whole body makes its a lot more believable instead of the gun being attached to your head when your seated.","Aug 31, 2016 at 6:44 AM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 15:32:17.464128,lordneep,Innovative and Well Crafted,"This game innovates where other games stammer. The teleportation system in most games feels like a hard limit of the current state of VR. Here it's skillfully woven into the narrative of the game, and never feels limiting. The game itself isn't anything ground breaking, it's a solid shooter with a decent sci-fi storyline. Nothing you're going to be telling your kids around the campfire, but nothing that's going to make you groan and try to skip cutscenes. The control of your gunsights with your head is very intuitive and works without a hitch. There is one train level towards the end that can be a little rough on the sickness prone, but it's entirely worth it for such a fine example of how well a shooter can be done.
