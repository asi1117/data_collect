2022-05-28 19:48:53.749240,TeacherAuthor,Not for me,"I know we all have different tastes, and I wasn't cruel enough to title my review ""Lame"" (which I almost did), but this was really slow developing. And to quote an earlier reviewer, the music is the only sound that comes through the headset. The dialogue is coming through the television (we use our TV as the gaming computer's monitor).","Aug 1, 2018 at 4:02 AM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 19:48:53.780157,FastLawyer,Nice start for 360 TV short series,"I'm giving this 5 stars not because it's currently a 5 star experience, but because it's off to a great start. This is one of the better directed episodic television-like series in VR. Good actors. Nice camera work. The 360 video is actually focused and not blurry.  You're looking at things from the main protagonist's point of view. My main criticism is the short length of each episode. This creates problems as far as the plot and the depth of the series. There's several things left to the imagination. I imagine this is because of current limitations with download speeds and bandwidth issues. I hope they are somehow able to overcome this limitation in the near future. I want a full 30 minute episode at least where we really get to see this story line developed.","May 12, 2018 at 2:51 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:48:53.795117,Pseudoviridae,Intresting little project,"Cool that some one is trying new stuff. Story was bit vague because of the lenght, but think of a horror movie filmed like this!","Jun 1, 2018 at 3:33 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:48:53.810077,Keevaughn,,Refreshing and original VR content.  Please continue with more episodes please!,"Jun 6, 2018 at 12:38 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:48:56.954314,HeyJunior,,"Thumbs up for the effort but there are plenty of human first person experiences (wink wink) in VR, that are much more advanced than this.","May 19, 2018 at 8:40 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:48:56.968276,imlocalpro,Great Short and Quality Filming,I hate to compare to other VR first person stories and dialogue but this has been the best so far amongst current choices.  The visuals were clear and engaging and the storyline pulled me in.  It would be nice to be able to pause the video.  I can't wait for more from this talented group!,"May 11, 2018 at 11:46 PM",5, 1,
