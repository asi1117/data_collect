2022-05-28 14:41:44.355520,UndeadEdd,Great spellcasting RPG,Overall great fun and look pretty good but sometimes the enemies just overwhelm you and there isn't much you can do since they fire homing missilles and you can't always kill them fast enough or avoid all of their attacks. Progress is saved frequently so dying isn't too much of a hassle.,21 days ago,5, 0,

Heck they got Arizona sunshine and that's got more action.... Or at least the same type of action.... Hoping they can Port it over to the quest and Quest too soon!","Apr 8, 2021 at 7:53 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:41:44.401396,RuneSR2,A dream come true - feels like magic ;-),"You really don't need more than this game to get full value for your Rift investment. If you're into the world of Harry Potter and love RPGs with magic - and if you ever dreamt about being a wizard - this game is a must have! Maybe it's just me having cleaned my glasses, but after the new patch (1.548 - a whopping 15GB!) it seems that many textures have been greatly improved in resolution and the performance too! I'm running the game on an overclocked GTX 1080 and i7 7700K (4.2-4.5 GHz) with 16GB PC3200 using highest settings and supersampling 2.0 - and I'm getting solid 90+ fps. It really feels like being there, the atmosphere, the humor and the ability to use magic are simply out-of-this-world. Remember that your Rift sensors each operate at 1000 Hz (I'm using 3 sensors for 360 degrees tracking - you really need it in this game), thus the faster you throw your fireball in the real world the faster it's thrown in VR - and there's just no way you can be faster than your sensors ;-) The full locomotion is brilliant (neither my son nor I ever felt motion sickness) and Touch controls let you throw, grip and manipulate objects - a true inspiration to how other VR games should implement Touch controls to make immersion perfect. BTW, try making a shield in each hand - now bring your hands/shields together and see how your 2 shields merge into one giant shield - simply awesome!
The game can be frightening for kids. My 10-year-old son more or less panicked when standing on a bridge and a 5 meters tall giant walked under the bridge :-)   
Although the action can be fast this is a thinking man's game (or challenge, there are quite a few puzzles in the dungeons - some optional). Consider your choice of spells wisely - and use them likewise! Don't judge the game before you've played at least one hour. 
Note that this game really isn't 5/5 - it's 6/5, and no I'm not trying to get the developers to like me, I'm simply stating the obvious. Wellcome to the dungeon!","Jan 19, 2021 at 6:42 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 14:41:47.544575,FastLawyer,"Classic Dungeon Crawler, VR must-have","This is a classic dungeon crawler with lots of puzzles and combat. You use fire, ice, lightning, & wind spells; along with modifiers like turning enemis to sheep with your wind spell or tripling the amount of fireballs you cast. However, this game is not perfect. It lacks polish & has several bugs. Even though it has full locomotion and smooth turning, you can tell it was originally built for teleportation only. 

Game took me 9 hours to complete. I had fun, but there were several frustrating parts as well. Including when just wave after wave of enemies comes towards you in some areas near the end of the game. It ran smoothly on my 1060 GTX, but several areas of the game are way too dark.

2022-05-28 14:41:47.559537,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Good game. Great mood.,"This is a well produced game with good atmosphere. It has a certain charm to it- like Waltz the Wizard. It is well polished. Graphics, sound, great for VR. I had no problems figuring out the controls as others have suggested.

Watch out- in Oubliette of Charn there is room with a lock box (the room with the three trophies) beware, don't enter the room- it is a one off puzzle. The solution? IDK. The dev thought it would be hilarious or something to make the box permanently disappear if you cross the door threshold. You can't ""gold"" the level without it. Lol- so much for all my ocd pixel hunting effort.","Jan 31, 2020 at 1:02 AM",5, 10,

It takes about five minutes to load the game once you get in, then you pick to reload another game or start a new one. After you do that it's another couple minutes of loading. And its another couple minutes of loading for doing just about anything. Also if you don't hold the controller correctly it'll just pause the game.","Oct 25, 2019 at 5:10 AM",1, 6,

I like dying at overwheliming odds and having to repeat content again and again. the locomotion is piss poor at best. Some of the traps were designed by a sadist.  its just made hard for the sake of being hard if your idea of difficulty is banging your head into a wall trying to luck into finding a way through this may be the game for you.

2022-05-28 14:41:50.702736,NikVR00,Issues with grabbing things,"Ive wanted to get this game for a while but now that Im playing there are issues. At the start area where I had to throw a potion in to start a new game, it would not let me pick up a potion despite me using the grip button. Then, after eventually picking one up and starting, in the first area where the red potion is located, I was unable to pick up the potion with either hand. Since I can tell grabbing things is a big part of the game, this killed the experience for me. I will consider returning to the game when this issue is fixed or I am given an explanation on how grabbing works if I am missing something.","Aug 11, 2019 at 3:13 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 14:41:50.719691,Braxus,Attention Developers,"I absolutely love this game, but I need to bring a matter to your attention. The ""Free Movement"" option has a limitation which almost made me want a refund. I want to use Free movement because using locomotion has always been annoying for me and hurts the immersion of a game. 

That being said, when I craft my first spell, the blue circle on the floor can't be fully reached when free movement is turned on. So the next phase of the tuturial where Crux shows you how to make a spell can't happen. What I had to do was exit out of the game and go back to the main menu and turn off free movement so I can move within the blue circle well enough to trigger the next event. 

Can you please fix this? This seems to be an issue throughout the game, and I don't want to have to keep going back to the main menu to turn off free movement just to advance the game further, and then turn it back on. 

Other than that, I want to thank you for making a fantastic game. I wish the VR community had more titles like this. We need more dungeon RPG games. I will keep my copy of The Mages Tale regardless of any hardships I may encounter as far as bugs or physics issues. This is a way of saying thanks for making a great game. I hope to see an update soon that fixes these types of free movement issues. It seems people have been having problems with collision detection in the game. Some getting stuck in walls, and my case where I can't move close enough to the caldron without turning off free movment.

Also can you consider adding smooth turning as an option? 

Thank you for your attention!","Jun 2, 2019 at 9:29 AM",5, 28,"Hey there, thank you for the kind words and the constructive feedback. Really appreciated. Regarding your comment, what you experienced is “as designed”. As an early Oculus Rift+Touch title, our original design and initial release was for Snap/Step movement only. Due to fan request, we went back in to add Smooth/Free movement, but as you can imagine it wasn’t an easy process implementing such a mode designed for a specific system. There are certain moments in the game where you *have* to snap to location for key moments, so players always have the aimed teleport - which will always lock in - on their off-hand controller. Because of that, there are some points in the game that can be rougher with smooth movement, but if you utilize the aimed teleport in those moments, it addresses those issues. 

Anyways, we really appreciated the feedback and wanted to pull back the gamedev curtain a little to let you know why that was. Thanks again and thanks for supporting the game!"

Swords and the like aren't really usable in The Mage's Tale. You can pick them up, but they have no functional use. The game is ""The Mage's Tale"" after all! :-) For the wooden obstacle you are dealing with, it can be burned down with a fireball spell. Cast a fire spell at it and you should be good to keep going."
2022-05-28 14:41:50.750608,Palieus,My thoughts,"The puzzles are interesting and can be challenging at times. In some instances you'll need to back track to solve a few, which is okay. 

My only draw back is if you're prone to “VR motion sickness” I don't recommend buying this. About every hour I had to stop and put the head set down due to feeling nauseous. Which has never happend to me before with other titles. Otherwise If you enjoy casting fire balls and exploring dungeons this is what you're looking for.","Apr 9, 2019 at 2:35 PM",3, 9,

I have to update this review: the fighting sucks. For a long time puzzle solving with no enemies and then a too many in small arenas. Hence you die quickly and for me this takes most of the fun out of the game. It would have been better to leave the fighting completly out of the game.","Jun 1, 2020 at 6:29 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 14:41:53.889819,PseudoSoul,An Absolute Must Have!,"I love this game.

Pros: 8-12 hours of gameplay, depending on if you just run through or try to found all of the secrets (and there are many).
Beautiful graphics and audio.
Easy to run on even lower-end PCs.
Plenty of options such as Locomotion, Dominant hand,...
Great story and flat out fun.

Cons: The smooth locomotion catches a little depending on the surface that you are walking on. I wish they would have smoothed out the collision for ground surfaces.","Feb 8, 2019 at 11:45 PM",5, 20,

2022-05-28 14:41:53.934699,taquitobuddy,Decent intro to VR,"Pros:
-Fantastic graphics, good overall audiowork, really love the ""main"" song
-Polished with nice production, story, and decent VR implementation
-Good amount of content, ~8-10 hours
-Good puzzles, using VR interaction and secrets to find

Cons:
-Combat is lackluster, especially because of the extremely limited spell variety (4 total spells, though you can modify them)
-No graphics adjustment options
-The RPG aspects are pretty superficial, definately an RPG-lite

Overall I would recommend this to newer VR users, or those that really love puzzles/exploration with some story.  More interesting than a pure puzzle game and it has great production values overall.  The severely limited spell variety and overall bland combat really bring it down though.  Wish they had 3-4 times as many spells and more ""special"" encounters like VS the Giant which was fun (but there are only a tiny number of these).","Mar 2, 2019 at 7:56 AM",3, 5,

Mage's Tale is pushing the dungon experience to the limit by integrating logic puzzles, satisfying fights using your magic and a story that is captivating. The game makes perfect use of the touch controlers and I forgot for the first time that I was actually playing a game. There is also great humor in the game that makes you laugh. The graphics are stunning to say the least and you feel like being in a D&D adventure. One of my kid's dreams became reality.","Jan 25, 2019 at 10:22 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:41:57.056953,Doodlebugz32,One of the best,"TLDR Summary; If you like dungeon crawler type games, you will love this game I think. Puzzles, hidden items, enemies to kill. The best game I've played in its category.

I don't normally review games, ever, but this game deserves a higher rating than what it has. I wasn't going to buy it based on some of the reviews, but a friend convinced me to give it a try.
First, the graphics are absolutely amazing, the level of detail in some of the smallest objects are beyond what I expected. 
There are many hidden items to find, puzzles to solve, enemies to kill. Going back through old levels to find all the missing items is optional but really fun for me.
The controls are by far the best out of similar games, with the option to free move or skip move, free turn or not, teleport forward, etc.
The amount of content is perfect for its price, I think for me I have invested about 8-10 hours so far (I haven't finished it), I am sure some can be quicker, depends on if you like to try to find everything or simply beat it.
I was concerned about throwing spells, as other games where throwing is involved can be quite horrible, however once you learn to make customized spells this is quickly solved. There are many more amazing things about this game, but I think I have covered the basics.
So, in summary... I highly recommend this game if you like dungeon crawlers. One of the best. I really hope there is a part 2 or some sort of expansion in the future.","Dec 27, 2018 at 1:21 AM",5, 25,"Thanks for the great review, we appreciate it and are happy you had a fun time."

It just sits there whilst all other titles update without issue. I have tried to uninstall the game, to re-install it, but it will not uninstall either. Can the Devs please help me?","Feb 18, 2019 at 6:17 AM",4, 2,"We are super happy you are enjoying it. (pardon the text formatting, it's being jammed together)

1. Try disabling antivirus for the install

2. Run the Oculus App as an Admin and attempt to update again. Right click the app and click “Run as Administrator”

3. Find the folder where Oculus is installed (normally “Program Files (x86)”) and make sure that the folder is NOT set to “Read Only” if it is, untick the box and click apply

4. Make sure that the location where the game is installed is not in the same location as where the Oculus Rift software is installed. If so specify a new spot that isn’t where the Oculus Rift software is installed and create a directory there to install any new games 


If none of the above solutions work, you can reinstall the entire App as an admin:


1) Interrupt the installation by logging out of Windows.

2) Uninstall the software: launch Oculus Home on your desktop, go to library, right 
click on the game, then select uninstall.
3) Exit out of Oculus Home.

4) Grant admin rights to your Windows account.  Go to Control Panel.  Under User Accounts, click on Change Account Type.  Select your account then change account type to Admin.

5) Reinstall the game.  Launch Oculus Home again, and reinstall the app.  It should be in the Library under Uninstalled.  Or you can search for it again on the Store."

Its sad but its true that if an experience is not suitable for those ages it will fail miserably... If you are older than 12 yo and you have grown up by playing classic dungeon crawlers this game is UNBELIEVABLE! Also its your only option on Oculus for this kind of games.

2022-05-28 14:42:03.391707,Zaga93,"Wonderful game, *atrocious* locomotion","Update: Microsoft acquired inXile, the dev of this game. RIP hopes of fixed locomotion.
-----
The step movement/smooth locomotion hybrid this game calls ""free movement"" is absolutely horrible. Lightly tilting the stick for a moment makes you take a slow, smooth step of a set distance. Tilting the stick all the way makes you first take this slow step, then lurch into motion. Trying to approach something you can't walk through doesn't move you up to the collision of the hitboxes, no, it estimates your movement based on some kind of tile system, and if you're about to move too close, it slides you away.

This game could be amazing if it just had proper movement. This botched insanity of a free locomotion implementation is just.. I *really* want to play this game, but I don't know if I can when just moving about is infuriating.

The menu system is really poor, too. It's just unnecessary friction. Friction upon friction ruining the joy of the rest of the game. Having ""immersive"" in-world elements is not worth it at the cost of ease of use. I don't want to be ""immersed"" in the game menu; I want to do what I went in to do & get *out* of the game menu ASAP.

I am sorry for the scalding review, devs, but my frustration with the locomotion is because it's a giant thorn in my side when playing a game that is otherwise delightful. Please just let free movement be free, no fiddling about with it. Movement speed directly proportional to stick tilt, with instant speed adjustment, and hard hitbox collisions. That would make *all* of this game delightful. And a simple clickable menu. That, too. Please, please, pretty please, and thank you. The rest of the game really is very nice.

Going to leave this game alone for a while and wish *really* hard that proper free locomotion gets implemented. If there's a possibility I could get to experience it with that, I'd much, much prefer doing so than suffering through with this movement system.","Nov 11, 2018 at 11:22 AM",1, 13,

Since May 27, InExile has sent out announcements all over the steam community of updates to versions 1.8 and 1.9 while the Oculus versions bought through Oculus appear to be stuck at 1.593
InExile has a habbit of chasing the $$$ and the Oculus version of the game is almost a year old while the steam platform is brand new and getting much of their attention. Looks like its dead here. --

As you can see below, they are trying to play down that they've included a manual in version 1.8 which they made available and identified on steam forums as being for all OCULUS and VIVE players. It was only made available to those who bought their copy on STEAM and ignored the rest of the Oculus community who were the original purchasers a year ago. 
Its not about the version number! Its about the missing content and the lose of attention to customers who bought it on Oculus instead of Steam before it was even available on Steam!","Jun 16, 2018 at 1:06 AM",4, 76,"JJ, that's a wrong conclusion. It's true that the Oculus Store version is behind, and that's unfortunately owning to contracted deadlines that the dev team needs to make. The plan is to cycle back to add in the patches. It should also be noted that a number of the items in those patches were Vive-centric, having no impact on Oculus owners. 

Also, the Oculus patch # is 1.593 b/c Oculus numbers its patches differently. We've worked with Oculus to get matching numbers between the two store fronts so that the Oculus Store version matches its patch number on other platforms. And of course, obviously the goal is to get them to match the most recent version (provided it is Oculus-applicable)."

Game is cool, but the more i get into it the more i end up getting bored fast, i wish there was more action and less puzzle and riddles, it get to the point i am bored now, int eh game description it says Action/RPG, i would sincerly change this to Riddle/Puzzle, once in a while is fun, but getting riddles every room you step in after opening a door after a puzzle with another awaiting is getting redundant. I'm at the puzzle with the solar system now with the planets you add and after 5 mintues i simply left the game with a huge « Darn it with those riddles, 20 minutes in game and all i did was 3 puzzles afetr each other, now time to head in another game to get some actions » If you like puzzles this game is for you, if you like some once in a while but not 5 puzzles out of an hour of game play and only 1 combat situation, this is not.

The few first hours of play, this game was 5 stars and now the more i get going, i'm at the Green Lady chapter now, it droped to 3 and i would even put 2, cuz i hate puzzles and it sohuld had been clarified that it was more puzzles than action. But overall, the game is great all is cool, i jsut vote low Stars cuz i hate puzzles à la Myst game. But controls are cool, interaction pretty much dead on, exept those kinda surprise boxes you turn the little lever, gotta dot it a few time cuz tracking gets trouble sometimes, speels are cool overall is awesome, But as i said, way too much puzzles and riddles for me, it kinda makes me loose my attention.","May 9, 2018 at 2:50 AM",3, 20,

2022-05-28 14:42:09.714921,TastEPlasma,,"TL;DR: This is a great, polished dungeon crawler for VR. 

I am really enjoying this game.  It is delivering on the level of immersion I had hoped for from VR in the first place.  The locomotion system is adaptable to suit playstyles/comfort level, and the controls in general are solid.  Casting magic, in combat or to solve the numerous puzzles hidden throughout, feels solid and responsive.  The menus that involve drinking potions in order to make choices is clever.

In addition to being technically solid, the content of the game is fantastic.  The puzzles, combat, lore and aesthetics all mesh together to create a really fun and engaging experience.  Chucking fireballs with one hand while blocking arrows with a magic shield is exhilirating and satisfying.  The game is challenging enough to require adapting tactics to the situation, without being teeth-gnashingly frustrating.  The collectable items are a nice touch, and encourage the player to use the VR tools at his disposal; peek around corners, look in the nooks and crannys.  The customizable magic system is also a nice dynamic.

This is one of the very best games VR has to offer right now.  I really hope we see more and more like this as the platform matures.","Apr 22, 2018 at 11:16 PM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 14:42:09.750825,DaggerSnake,First Impression is Fantastic!,"It was a long day at work as I knew this had been released today. I've just played the first 30 mins and I have to say, ""WOW"".  This is the stuff I dreamed about growing up playing D&D and games like Bards Tale.  I'm finally in a dungeon!  The graphics, the sound, the cheeky humor.  It's all there.  The movement takes a little bit before muscle memory kicks in and it becomes more natural.  I'm going to take this one slow and savor every room and moment.  Must have for Oculus!  Well done inXile!

Update : I'm now a couple hours in. Still amazing.  I think that the movement could use some polish.  I'd like to see the teleport able to adjust direction before moving, similar to Robo Recall.  A smooth movement option would be great for people too.  Still blown away and loving it.  I'm feeling sad that it will be over at some point...

Update 3/29/2018 : I've returned to Mages Tale after a break playing multiple other games.  I noticed there were some updates.  I logged in and again, this is amazing.  There are more movement options for people.  But I find that just the teleport is fine.  I'm now running an extra sensor full 360 and it's running and moving great.  Time to get back to this story and finish the game! Still a 5 star and one of my favorites in the Library.  I'd really love to see this in a multi-player co-op form.  There are so many moments and puzzles to solve, I'd love to share that with someone.","Mar 30, 2018 at 1:05 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 14:42:12.934387,DNACowboy,A Sign Of Wonderful Things To Come,"I have been a true fan of Michael Crawford's 'Bards Tale' series of rpg's since the 80's and when I read that Bards Tale 4 was in the works I kickstarted that project so fast the cash fairly flew out of my wallet. Which brings us to The Mage's Tale, I was not an early adopter of TMT because at the time I was deeply involved in Fallout VR; however, once I booted it up I was SO pleased because TMT has amazing graphics, fantastic puzzles, true characterisation of the NPC's and most importantly, the sum total was far greater than it's constituent parts. To me, this meant that the same developers were definitely going to produce a high-quality AAA title in their new Bards Tale rpg. 
The only thing that holds back TMT from 5 stars in the emptiness, as in a bland 'sameness' inherent and duplicated in some of the areas. The voice-acting is of amazing quality and completely in keeping with the story and environments. The rich, in-depth magic system is a wonder to behold and use, that alone was worth every penny of the purchase price!

In closing, my greatest hope is that one day InExile wil bring their new Bards Tale 4 to VR and then, I believe fans will have truly gone to RPG heaven.","Mar 1, 2018 at 9:25 PM",4, 9,

The game itself has great combat, spells did not get repetitive for me at all and the shield mechanics are neat. The costum spells make the game that much better and the puzzles are not anything too extreme. One thing that I found weird was that you cant turn down or up graphics and stuff like that. No options that allow you that type of customizing. Havent had much trouble myself but still. Buy this if you are looking for a great campaing mage style.","Mar 11, 2018 at 5:58 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 14:42:16.069613,Elpoc,Janky,"There are some good things in here, but overall the feel of the game is extremely janky. Picking up objects is unreliable. Movement can be frustrating as there are lots of bits of the maps where you think you should be able to stand but can't - it's especially bad when you're trying to stand next to e.g. a chest or your potions table. The sliding movement mechanic was completely half-arsed, you have to use teleportation to get close to a lot of stuff as you can't slide up to it for some reason.
The visuals aren't bad and the magic effects are quite fun and somewhat satisfying to use. But combat mostly involves running back and forth across rooms avoiding the enemies (which is incredibly easy to do) and then just blasting them over and over with whatever your most powerful spell is.
The story and world are quite enjoyable though. But why they chose the most annoying voice possible for your demon companion is beyond me. I think it's meant to be funny? But the 'funny' is just it constantly being ridiculously exasperated and sarcastic, continuously, forever.
Overall this could have been great and is not unenjoyable, but is seriously let down by poor quality control and a lack of polish.","Feb 26, 2018 at 7:33 PM",2, 8,

Then, later in the game, I found a healing potion, but I was not able to pick it up. That is very frustrating. Also, the loading times are quite high. It has a moderate gfx, but still, I have to wait for a long period, although I have not the weakest pc (GTX 1060, I7-7700K)).

I've had to use their secret emergency reset because I loaded inside a door, and I've had to change the movement type because their stepping teleporty mode wouldn't let me cross a bridge (If you have your 'VR legs', they do offer smooth locomotion). Also, although the store page says 360 is supported, it is clearly designed to be front facing. 
Bugs aside, the game is enjoyable, if not particularly revolutionary. Essentially they've taken a fairly basic dungeon crawl formula and translated it into VR, turning what would otherwise have been a bland game into something that can be quite fun.

Visual style and graphics are really pretty good and it is competently voice acted (although the companian goblin thing is the only NPC you'll spend any time with and he's not really a likeable character).

Some cool ideas explored with the menu system, some nifty puzzle type things and a pretty fun spell system are unfortunately let down by a lack of polish on the core mechanics.

I was really surprised), the puzzles make you think but are not so hard as to make you give up, and you are always wondering what is going to be behind the next door. I would say the weakest part is combat, can be a bit repetitive and the AI is not the brightest, but I did have quite a few adrenaline pumping moments from it.

In this day and age, smooth analogue movement within a game is a basic requirement. There is no smooth turning option so your stuck with snap rotation which kills the vr experience for me. I realize these options are to limit motion sickness but...I like those feelings, it's the reason I bought a VR headset!! I stopped playing after 15 minutes. :( Edit: I've played a little more now and it's even worse than I thought.

My main issue is the controls feel really unresponsive. While your character is walking for example he will get 'stuck' wherever the terrain is uneven. I picked up a sword hoping I could use it to do some hand to hand battle and the moment I swung it against an opponent it it made a glass breaking sound and it was gone. In one of the more advanced battles I found myself strafing side to side an arena while enemies were passing through me and i was trying to turn around to find these dudes that were almost inside of my space while getting stuck on everything. I had no idea how many times I was hit as the cues that I had taken damage looked like the weird fire I get around my character when using fireballs sometimes, that don't have a corresponding lack of hp. Overall still feels like it lacks a lot of polish, I find myself wishing I could enjoy it but I don't.

A very arresting Gaelic song makes for a great introduction and recurring theme. Though maybe a little too recurring when you're hearing the same 4-8 words every time you hit a loading screen!

Spellcasting is intuitive, very comparable to other magely VR games. As long as you don't go in expecting to throw fireballs like baseballs, you should get the hang of it quickly.

The left stick's locomotion feels REALLY good. My favorite method in all of VR. I've been a big fan of this stepping approach ever since Technolust's option, and wish I saw it more often. Even better here because it's a smooth transition rather than instantaneous. 

Some little bits of feedback I would have for the developers in terms of ""polish"" would be:

#1: Audio sync with potion drinking. Taking a swig only to put it back down while the sound effect keeps chugging is surprisingly jarring!

#2: Haptics on touching interactable objects, not just selecting them. For instance, at the cauldron, touching that Lazy Susan of flasks to the right, to rotate it, has no haptic feedback on contact or rotation, while merely pointing at the color flasks does. That feels weirdly upside-down, doesn't it?

#3: Better syncing haptics with visuals in general. A prominent example would be the gem on the right glove that glows to offer a level up. The glow is constant and gentle, but the haptic feedback is a strong, intermittent, half-second or so pulse. Surely it would be better to either pulse the gem along with the haptics, or bring the haptics to a lower-powered constant drone. --- Whoa, we need line breaks in this review system.","Oct 16, 2017 at 4:00 AM",4, 3,

Its like im stuck leveling up but can't because its a boss battle.

So this game is great but sadly I can't give it 5 stars because the main mechanic of the game, spells, has some issues.  
So you level up BUT you spells do not increase in damage. There are components you can put together but nothing about these is ever explained so your left to guess what they might do and thus far I've not seen them increase the damage for spells.  You would think the fireball would be one of the more powerful spells but its actually one of the weakest.  So its because of this lack of good mechanics on the spell effects that i have to knock it down to 4 stars.

The biggest draw is finding all the secrets and solving the puzzles as you explore the dungeons, reminded me alot of what I imagined hogwarts (harry potter) might be like when I used to read the books. It rewards you for exploring and deviating from the main path. Combat is another focus although it's not perfect, at times it likes to pit you against a crowd of enemies that either shoot from afar or rush at you like bulls. Would have been nice if they added more AI behaviour. The graphics are great, the last few dungeons are amazing and completely blow away the earlier dungeons in design (and puzzles).

Head and shoulders above pretty much everything with very few exceptions. If you like VR and dungeons it is a dream come true.   Everything following this no longer relevant given fixes.  ------------------old review -------->

Ok, the reticle is not so bad, because not long after you get the spell that makes the reticle continuously appear you get another spell that can be selected to get rid of it. The sensor issue mentioned below is still active. Once/if that is fixed will be easily a 5 star. For me the load times are not an issue, given that we are in the very early stages of the technology, if that is what it takes to deliver content like this, then so be it. Reticles there when you don't need them and sensor apparitions appearing almost constantly are another matter, as those are either bugs or design decisions.  
Previous review follows:
From what little I've seen the dungeon is five star. But once I activate my fire spell I get a reticle dead center that will not go away, and I can't deactivate the fire spell. Unplayable for me with the reticle always on, continuous immersion breaker.  WIll update once this is resolved.  Now I have since learned that once you get a little into the game you get a different spell that you can activate so the retcile is not always on. But unfortunately this is not the only aspect of the game that is continuously immersion breaking, as it now stands. Specifically, if you have a 3 sensor setup, every time you are not facing one of your sensors that sensor appears in the game, so that when you turn back toward it, there it is, hanging in the air for a couple seconds before it fades away.  Don't know if it happens with a 2 sensor 360 degree diagonal setup or not. Hopefully this is a bug they will eliminate soon.","Jul 15, 2017 at 1:20 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 14:43:06.807925,DaigojiGai,No slideshow; A legit dungeon crawler!,"Hmm, far from an early impression and quite far in the game. Using the Oculus Touch controls and navigating, combat, the aim system all works flawlessly. If you played the old Eye of the Beholder games, the Wizardry series, Ultima Underworld, Arx Fatalis, Legend of Grimrock, or the countless JRPG dungeon crawlers you'll feel right at home. Once you master the movement controls you'll go from the traditional forward/back strafe movement in those games to combining it with the teleport to jump around and reposition yourself for defense or unleash a magical attack.

The crafting system and exploring your, sorry, your master's ""former"" lair is immersive and rewarding. [Explore! So much to touch and play with! Secrets to find!] Even early on without many ingredients I spent waaay too much time mixing, stirring and creating the same spells from the sheer joy of it - and the flexibility in the magic crafting system is impressive. 

Then of course, there is the rock solid classic inXile humor that harkens back to The Bard's Tale games. 

I will be playing the heck out of this game for some time to come. Along with Bridge Crew, one of the best executions of Touch and unlike most of the demo-ware, ""stationary endless wave games"" or brief 4 hour experiences... this is an actual legit game. 

My one wish would be to see a love child that keeps everything from this game and throws in some of the magical gesture gimmicks seen in Unspoken (along with co-op).

This is a no brainer must buy and anyone calling this a slide show must never have played a dungeon crawler. Your freedom of movement here and movement control surpasses L.o.Grimrock.

Not sure what others are running on, but load times are less than 15-30 secs* for me (installed on SSD) and frame rate hasn't dropped even later on during chaotic combat, particle effects, me ducking and hurling fireballs, etc (1080;4GHz Win 10 64Bit; 32GB RAM) so - yeah, this game runs flawlessly for me with no performance issues whatsoever.","Jul 3, 2017 at 11:25 AM",5, 16,

2022-05-28 14:43:09.932174,kiriattila,Could me smoother,"First the good things:
- Graphics, sound and overall design is very good. 
- It is quite funny :) If you just stop doing anything at the starting screen, the instructor gets mad, and you'll immediately get an overall feeling about the humorous part of the game. Or try to eat some mushrooms and enjoy the effect ;)
- The tutorial is very good embedded into the gameplay. I really felt like a rookie mage apprentice.

Now the sad part, after around 1 hour of play:
- The game loads a lot, especially at start-up (for a few moments I thought that it crashed)
- The combination of locomotion and teleport system is in my humble opinion much worse then the one in Robo Recall.
- Somehow the Touch controllers are not handled so accurate like in other games I am used to. Sometimes the item is highlighted, but still I cannot operate or grab it, and it is quite confusing.
- and I also felt some framerate problems as well

These negative things very sufficitent for me to give a slight headache. I think the game needs some fine-tuning. E.g. I would really like a control option like the one in Robo Recall, because the current mixture is quite confusing.

In general, I would recommend it to anyone who is in love with fantasy dungeon-crawlers.

Update 2017-07-20 : just started the game new after it updated itself. It seems that the developers made their homework, and listened to the community. New locomotion option is added. The irritating, alway visible rectange can be now switched off. But the best part is, that the loading times are significantly reduced.

The spell casting is intuitive and combat works quite well. As you gain levels you also get to choose upgrades for your character. The game seems to be fairly linear when following the story but the areas have little side areas to them with puzzles and so on. Graphically the game looks great and it runs smoothly.

The developers understood that we want to interact with the world in VR.  If you want to make a spell, you have to mix it in a cauldron.  If you want to exit the game, you must drink a potion.  Throwing spells means that you actually throw them at your opponents.  Because of this, the world feels alive and tangible.  You end up feeling like a wizard.  Furthermore, the graphics are beautiful and well realized, and the game has inventive puzzles that mess with scale and allow us to play with VR controls in creative ways.  On top of this, the fighting in the game is loads of fun.  This is the first VR game that I've played that has nailed every aspect of gaming that I enjoy.  There are some issues with the game's animation, especially the human characters, but overall this is the complete package.

BUG: After completing the Magic Mirror puzzle, I place myself in front of the mirror(At the pre-set spot to stand), then Im stuck there. Imp is silence, I cant move, I cant use spells, change spells. Only way to exit is to pause the game and either go back to last checkpoint or exit to main menu.

2022-05-28 14:43:16.303471,Akriant,One of the better VR games out there.,"For a VR game, and the first VR outing of the studio - it's a fairly solid product. It's a dungeon crawl, if you like dungeon crawls in general - you should give this one a go. You'll get ok-ish visuals, goofy story and dialogues which suits the setting and tone of the game, some puzzle solving, a free-ish range of movement. So far, for me at least, the weakest aspect of the game is combat, due to movement, reload times of the spells, and precision. I'd say the best implementation of combat where you move around is done in Robo Recall at this point. Here, devs tried to give you the option of teleportation and grid-based movement a-la dungeon crawl games, but it feels cluncky and I end up running circles around waiting for spells to reload and it's just not as fun as it could be. With that said, I got used to it and maybe it will get better down the line whether with additional spells or through the magic power of patching. With all that said - if your Oculus is dusting on the shelf and you hope to give it some use - give this game a go, it's one of the better and stronger titles out there, and I'm happy that Oculus had this gem on offer.","Jun 22, 2017 at 11:56 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 14:43:16.321423,vanfanel,Dungeon crawler fans rejoice!,"There have been a few attempts at a first-person dungeon crawler in VR's first year with Vanishing Realms being the best of the bunch but I think they've all just been teasers of what could be a great genre for VR. I think Mage's Tale with it's graphics, sound, gameplay and story finally gives us the most polished version yet.

I've spent about 2 hours in the game so far and it's really one of the best experiences I've had and I've had many. The environments are beautiful and exploration leads to rewards. Spellcasting is well done and unspoken players will feel right at home here. The puzzles aren't too easy or too difficult. It's just the right amount that doesn't feel like hand holding but also isn't a head scratcher. The movement system may be a point of contention for some but it works perfectly fine for me. Even with the dash system I still had slight hints of nausea.

Mage's Tale may not turn out to be the best dungeon crawler by the time the first generation of headset are replaced but it has definitely set a high bar. If you're a fan of any of the vr dungeon crawlers that have been released so far then this is a must purchase.","Jun 21, 2017 at 12:58 PM",5, 9,

The graphics are okaish for vr, the humor is there - the gameplay might be fun - cant say much about it, but 5min loading time just to enter the main menu and another 5min + to enter the first cut scene and another 5 min to enter the first level is just stuff that shouldnt be in a 40 Eu game in 2017 - regardless of the platform. And its not like the levels are huge, its not like you can play after you loaded the level for long - you will encounter next 5 min+ loading time screen as soon as you need to craft one spell, since you have to return to the main menu level. And after that you have to return to your current level - have fun with another loading screen that takes 5min+. It might be a very good game, with good content and fun mechanics - without playing it much ( i am only in the second level so far) I think it is a very solid AAA level game - but its just technically broken and unplayable atm.

2022-05-28 14:43:32.171239,merano2,After patch worth playing :-),"As promised, I want to refine my review, because the new patch removed my biggest complains: locomotion an loading times. Eventually there is smooth movement (but no smooth turn, snapturn remains untouched), and the loading times are drastically reduced. Good work, inxile!
So I am happy to increase from 2* to 4*
Why not 5*? Because overall I am a little bit disapointed from the magic system: There could have been more creativity and variaty in magic spells and using them in puzzles - but that´s my personal taste, it is a realy good game now.-----------------------------

[old review] ----------------------------->>>
I am pretty shure, that most positive reviews are early impressions. In the beginning the game is slow paced an you will be impressed by visuals and atmosphere.
But soon you will have to fight against tougher enemys, and the first problem occurs: The terrible movement system. The left analog stick lets you move in four directions in small jumps, the right stick lets you turn in small portions. So, while trying to avoid attacks or to move behind cover, the visuals alre divided into slices of a very fast stuttering slideshow - you will lose orientation and get headache.
In ""exploration mode"" I use teleportation with the right jumpstick, this feels much smoother but does not realy work while casting spells with your right hand.
The second BIG issue is the huge loding time of more than a minute. If you die in a fight or if you are in a try and error room with one shot traps and have to wait one minute after every fail, you wont love this game (and the song in the loading screen) as much as you did in the beginning.
If we get smooth turning, free locomotion and improved loding times, (and better touch controller tracking), I would love to change my review, but in the current state it is no fun to play.","Jul 14, 2017 at 7:51 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 14:43:51.206579,J_Trill,Looks good and nothing else.,"It's pretty polished and definitely makes you feel like a mage. The combat is interesting enough and some of the simple puzzles are pretty cool. I've only played for about an hour into the game so far.

I don't understand the reticle that exists. I think it might help with your ""seeking"" spells? It's a little odd of a mechanic.

The other thing is the step-move system is pretty odd. I get that it is trying to stop people from getting motion sick, but it's just awkward. If they replace the step motion with full locomotion and leave the teleport system in place I think the game would be better. Most of the time the side-stepping messes me up, so I just avoid it and teleport instead.

Overall though, the game is pretty polished and assuming it holds up to the 8-10 hour gameplay that most reviews state it has it should be a pretty good game and worth the price!

UPDATE: Well right after I wrote my review my game glitched and I lost that hour or so I played of progress... It never actually saved my game. I've played about another 2.5 hours. Combat has become stale and there are certain enemies with homing missles that are really annoying since you can't dodge their projectiles, you just huck fireballs (fireballs is the first spell you learn). In other fights there are similar enemies and I just huck fireballs. The wind spell is in my rotation, but lightning/ice have such long cooldowns I don't even use them, they're borderline useless. I took a star away just cause as I've gotten further I've gotten more bored since hucking fireballs at goblins for 3 hours in new environment isn't that satisfying compared to shooting them with a gun or at least having a legitimate choice to be as effective using another school of magic.

LOCOMOTION UPDATE: It's really underwhelming. Annoying footsteps, and half the time I don't go the direction I want. This game kind of sucks unless you really enjoy doing stupid puzzles.","Jul 16, 2017 at 1:05 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 14:43:51.224531,Dr Greg VR,free locomotion and it's an 11,"I'm not sure why some are having such issues with load times.  I have been counting and even the most massive levels so far and I am not haveing more than 12 seconds for loads.  GTX 1080 i7 770 16 gigs ram. From the moment I was dropped into the main menu of this game I was impressed.  Then the opening sequence started and I had goose bumps.  The character animations and voice acting and visual effects, sound design,. everything!  This game does an amazing job at pulling you in and blowing you away from square one!  The Graphics, and sound,. top notch.  battle is so fun and makes you feel powerful. I love just the feeling of walking around, seeing a random barrel, charging a fire ball and with a slight flick of the wrist sending the barrel and all it's peices flying in a grand explosion.  I find myself laughing a ton.  Great humor!  the puzzles are fantastic as well!  This game has it all and really feels like the days of playing Dungeons and Dragons only you are really there and the monsters are real! my only gripe is the locomotion.  Not that I mind teleport all that much if I must, but when you are trying to charge a spell and fight with your right hand, if feels natural that you would control locomotion with the left,. but if you do that you only move one little hop at a time and in a battle with multiple enemies coming at you in all directions that is a way to die fast.  That still isn't enough for me to drop the score on this at all I love this game so much!  But give me free locomotion with my left hand and it's an 11!","Jul 2, 2017 at 8:14 AM",5, 10,
