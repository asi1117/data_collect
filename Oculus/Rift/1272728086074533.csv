2022-05-28 18:45:22.244609,RetroRocker,Not easy,"Okay, the graphics are exceptional, and the concept is great.  But this is by far the most difficult game I've played.  Requires a knowledge of base 4 math which sent me screaming and searching for hints and walkthroughs. :-)  I've made it through Myst  and most other walker/puzzle games, without the need to do so, but not this one.  If you're looking for a real challenge, then this game is for you.",Mar 8 at 10:08 AM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:45:22.259569,AstroPool42,What I Expected,"I've played all of the Myst related titles and so I have a high bar. Graphics, lore, environment, and ambiance were all well done. Some puzzles were challenging and some were straight forward. The detail in these games is great and the nuances, references and easter eggs, callbacks were great. Just like other games by Cyan, I've spent a lot of time admiring the handiwork and running around doing things that have done nothing to help me at all but were still fun to do. 

Every critique I have had while playing so far had been with my headset or settings or something else minus achievements. There are 15 secret ones and I imagine with Cyan's style, like in the past, there are some of them allotted for doing things during the story. Maybe it's because I'm playing on a Quest 2 using Link but I can't get any achievements in this game. Not game breaking but achievements are fun.

Clever title and well done.","Apr 2, 2021 at 10:53 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:45:22.275526,DankKat,Can't earn achivements,Why can't I unlock any achievements in this game? I think there's a bug. It's making me not want to continue to play. I contacted support at the game's website but no one is replying. I tried uninstalling and uploading again but the achievements still won't unlock. I even tried repairing the Oculus software. I'm playing on a Quest 2 using link. Maybe that's the problem.,"Apr 17, 2021 at 11:41 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 18:45:22.289489,thecoyote99,Love the Miller brothers,"Would love to actually get in touch with you guys direct. Been playing your games since Myst came with my Performa in 1995 lol. I love the stories you tell and the worlds you create. This is no different. The only thing I wish you would implement tho is an ability to skip puzzles. I'm not a genius and I usually rage quit your games 100 times before I finish it. I just push through for the story. Maybe its not how you want things to work but some of us really aint the best at puzzles. Also, I just bought Myst VR which is great but I miss the FMV acting. Rand was good as Atrus and hope he reprises his role when u release Riven VR ;)","Dec 21, 2020 at 5:35 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:45:22.305447,sgtslaughter603,Like Myst 3 but VR!!!,"I am a HUGE fan of the Riven/Myst series, so naturally I was very excited when this game dropped. So far, I have not been disappointed. If you run it on snap turns and teleportation movement, it feels just like myst 3. Complete with the quicktime videos of real people. Very immersive with that creepy myst vibe that you are not really alone... 

For those of you not familiar with the series, yes they are very difficult. There aren't many clues, or hints and the game does not tell you what to do. Just like real life.you just have to go with it and think a little. Stop complaining it is too hard.","Jul 13, 2020 at 1:37 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:45:25.441060,yaichy,Has a potential,"I started the game after reading so many great feedbacks having five stars rating in mind, I finished with one star rating. On the good note, this game has a lot of potential, it is very immersive, long and has wonderful graphics. On the other side, the game plot is very weak, too little action and puzzles, lack of logic and too much useless walking which is very annoying. Come on, aliens who eat humans? lol Absence of maps, clues and interactions make it quite boring. At the end I was so tired of walking through the same paths again and again, it became annoying. Anyway, some people may like it and they may be right. Personally, I think this game is not for a casual gamer like me.","Apr 15, 2020 at 11:13 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 18:45:25.456020,EricBarnasson,Amazing immersion and story-telling,"The best puzzle/adventure game I did in VR !
I did all Cyan's games since the beginning (excepted the recent ZED) and I was quite interesting to make Obduction in VR.
Even though it is a bit below (in term of complexity) Myst and Riven, it is nevertheless a high-level game !
If you take time to observe your environment and read every books/notes around you, all the riddles are affordable and logical.
I eagerly wait for Firmament, Cyan's next game !
Thanks a lot guys for these fantastic games and I hope that you will adapt soon Myst games in VR as well.","Aug 11, 2019 at 8:44 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 18:45:25.470980,mishka11,Graphics motion blur.,"I really love puzzle games and loved Myst/Riven since their release.  So was excited to play Obduction.  Problem is...no matter how i set the graphics up...there is a significant amount of jittering and nausea-inducing blur.  Evertime you teleport, the scene gets blurred then quickly snaps into clarity. Even in free roam there is the same motion blur yet not as bad.  I have plenty of memory and no problems with the other 20-25 games on my pc.

The reason I bought this was for the VR experience. The VR version is stunning and I would like to play it completely using VR, but I am forced to play most of it in the flat screen version, because I am disabled, and cannot reach some of the interactive oblects in VR, as my legs or wheelchair get in the way.

At first I was skeptical about the quality because it came out in 2016, however after playing through it and reaching the second world after Hunrath, I see how much work and detail the writers and designers put into it.  great scenery and very challenging obstacles.  Only downside is that the puzzles provide little clues and are therefore so challenging that I end up looking at online guides just to save myself the time of not troubleshooting for hours.","Jan 3, 2019 at 3:06 PM",5, 5,

Puzzles and the game in general is way harder than Myst. The one star is mainly because that it is hard to move around, and that I gave up early.

Update: Gave it another shot, and now they have both free locomotion and free teleport mode, instead of the node movement that was a year ago. It is still the same difficulty, but I see now that the game is well done and very good graphics. The game hangs when you quit though.","Dec 2, 2018 at 11:45 PM",3, 3,

Textures & lighting are top notch throughout the game. Story line is well imagined & fresh. The puzzels are fun and, on a difficulty rating of 1-10, I would say they span the range at 4-6.Controls are ""okay"" they need to be tweaked a bit. 
They are the the only element of this game preventing me from going 5 stars.

2022-05-28 18:45:38.110174,Justinbxz666,I mostly played it on flat screen,"Don't get me wrong though, this is spectacular in VR, probably one of the most beautiful games you could play in VR with quite a few different landscaps and a reasonably long gameplay. Puzzles were intriguing and an interesting story was uncovered as you progress. Surprise elements were definitly there. Problem is that it involves long walks and countless backtracking to solve the puzzles and it gets annoying pretty soon in VR. Luckily the game switchs into flat screen mode as soon as you put away your headset so that's how I finished the most part. Regardless a great experience, would solve base 4 again!","Jan 3, 2018 at 2:14 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 18:45:38.126132,RuneSR2,Awesome game!,"Using GTX 1080 and supersampling 2.0 I had to lower antialiasing and shadows to medium to get 90 fps (or very close), all other settings work fine set to ""Epic"" (water = high of course). In this game, shadows are very demanding for the video card, but I really don't notice much difference between using ""medium"" or ""epic"" for shadows detail, and generally graphics are truly out-of-this-world (pun maybe intended ;-) BTW, supersampling didn't work in-game and had to be set using Tray Tool (sometimes I had to restart Tray Tool to get supersampling working). The game doesn't autodetect Touch, so remember to choose Touch for controls. I had to choose full locomotion in-game to get it working (by turning off teleport movements), and there's also smooth turning. In-game you can now ""always run"", which is great! So Touch controllers, ""always run"", full locomotion and graphics are all working nicely, and I'm basically happy with the game. 
Regarding the gameplay, I should have eaten more veggies as a kid, this game will demand all your brain power and ask for more :-)
PS. If you don't have any sound remember to set Rift as your primary sound device not your monitor.

This game will blow your mind, it's a must have if you like adventure and puzzle games. I've completed Lone Echo, still I think this game may be my favorite Rift game (if only the game was more optimized, it's incredibly hardware demanding, sigh)","Dec 19, 2017 at 5:59 AM",5, 17,

Definitely play with the control settings to get it to your liking, I enjoy the intense settings which is basically using the thumb sticks to walk around and you can still use touch controllers to manipulate buttons, levers, etc.  Per another suggestion I turned shadows to medium and left everything else at epic (GTX 1080) and performance has been fantastic.

I was more than happy with my purchase and the length and tempo of the game, but then! I discovered portals! (Wont spoil it!) But the game suddenly got about Ten times bigger. My mind has been truly blown by the scenery and epic scale of some of the set design. I am still in the middle of it, I belive and some of the more taxing puzzles that fry even my tiny mind, can be got past by a quick look on YOUTUBE walk throughs. (Yes! THE MAZE! I am talking about you!) So you are never truly stuck! I am honestly captivated by this game and it is my now! (Go TO) VR experience that I show to those yet to be taken by the VR bug.

As a fan of the original Myst + Riven series I absolutely had to play this in VR. It's classic Cyan doing the genre like only they can do. VR adds that dimension that was missing in all their previous games of actually being in the world. It's really, really neat being able to physically look up while standing at the bottom of a canyon and have it tower over you. It really takes you there.","Oct 29, 2017 at 9:40 PM",4, 10,

I can't imagine playing this game without VR. The sense of presence and wonder is magnified many times through the headset.

I ran it at high - ultra with the pixel density at 1.7 there is nothing to match its unique atmosphere as you travel through these dream like worlds, maybe Chronos is similar. Its just nice to play a game that has a bit of soul instead of the usual generic games.
The puzzle element is great & was a real challange, the idea is very creative & clever imo. 
Downside, touch intergation is clunky & a bit buggy. The hands also look rubbish & out of place.
Some menu settings are a bit buggy or just don't work.

2022-05-28 18:45:44.438250,Namssor,Buggy!!,"This should be in Beta!!! Here's my bug report to Cyan for the Oculus (you're welcome):

1. Hunrath: The tower elevator suspends the player between lower level floors. The only way to get out of this is to reset the height of first person and play boundary to reach the button on the floor below. This brings the elevator back down. Lots of wasted time trying to fix this in game!

2. Hunrath water crossing: Not sure if this was intended, but walking from one side to the back section of Hunrath is still possible after the walkway gets permanently locked in the open position when the upper level is lowered. This defies logic since it is essentially walking on water, plus there are ways back to the other side at this point in the game besides the water crossing.

3. Maray: The first teleporter location in Maray (from Hunrath) allows a view of the lower gate from a position suspended in mid air. Unfortunately, once one goes out this far over the edge there is no way to get back to the teleporter. Game is stuck! Time for a restart, and deletion of the game instance!

4. The Gauntlet: This confusing section invlolving multiple teleporters has a serious bug that locks the game into a permanent ""loading"" screen for that game instance. I didn't find a way to solve this issue even after a reinstall. Time to delete the game instance and start a new one, unfortunately!

I give Obduction one star for the content writers and one star for the game artists. The coders, QA folks, and project managers did not get any stars from me. I feel like I should be getting paid $30 from Cyan rather than the other way around. That rate would be a bargain for the time I have wasted on this game! Deleted, and I don't care how spectacular the ending is. I'll watch it in 2D on YouTube.","Sep 4, 2017 at 10:45 PM",2, 10,

Puzzles are like that : look from top, take the elevator down, teleport, loading, climb tons of stairs, rotate object, go down tons of stairs, teleport, loading, take the elevator up again (for at least 30 times if you are lucky). So many puzzles involve loading between worlds every 30 seconds and so many times. I am a myst 1-2-3 fan, but this thing is horrible even with the solution. In vr you walk like a turtle and no way to go faster. Teleport in vr is also very slow.

2022-05-28 18:45:47.617745,Elpoc,Wasted potential,"This is not a well-done port to VR. Performance is terrible, but even more importantly, you have to fiddle with settings to get the whole mid-far field of view not appear weirdly blurred. You have to turn off AA entirely. But then of course you get jaggies, which can't be removed by supersampling when you're playing a game with a lot of grass etc.
Beyond that, at some point since the Touch release they must have changed the controls and not bothered to update the map in the 'controls' menu. I couldn't figure out how to get running speed so it takes forever to get anywhere. For a game where you'll mostly be walking around the place looking/at stuff, that's deadly.
Finally, the Touch implementation is very half-hearted. There are very few things you can pick up, so you spend your time going around putting your ghost-hands through lots of 3D models.

2022-05-28 18:45:50.712468,westingtyler,Game breaking bugs :(,"I swear, I'd love to give this game an actual review, but my experience of the game IS as a bug tester, apparently. And I paid $20 to do it. When it works, it's an immersive and relaxing game with cool ""video people"" like Myst, and challenging puzzles. Maybe you won't see the following problems:
===
1) Two times on different save files, I got ""Fatal Error"" and the game froze and closed. The first fatal error happened near the river propeller thing. Maybe I was teleporting around too fast. The second fatal error crash happened when I got into a little vehicle and my hands stayed floating around outside and could teleport on their own.  
===
2) The red button at the bottom of the workshop, and a few others like the train yard generator, locked my hand in place weirdly when I clicked on them, and I had to click again on the button to ""release"" my hand, and until then I couldn't do anything. Checking in Oculus Home showed my hands working normally in all cases. It was just this software causing the problem.

The next one was the most exciting and fun: 3) In the middle of town is a dark, dead-end mine with a little shovel in it. I moved (using teleport) into the back of it and fell out of the world. Then it teleported me to the top of a mountain where I could not move (because the area wasn't ""teleportable"", though if the game included ACTUAL movement options, this wouldn't have been an issue), and it SAVED the game while I was trapped motionless on the mountain. So I had to start a new save file entirely, losing all progress, but I got some pretty pictures standing atop the mountain before I started over, so that's a plus. 
+ moving quickly caused frame rate hitches, loading up takes awhile, and invisible walls in your face make movement obnoxious often.","May 17, 2017 at 12:23 AM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 18:45:50.728425,cybernettr,Tough puzzle game,"If you are not good at puzzle games, you had better watch some videos on this game or get a good guidebook (if there is one) as the game has its own internal logic (such as teleportation) that does not necessarily match the way things work in the real world. The game actually gets HARDER as you unlock more areas, as you must then remember how to get from one area to another -- you will be bouncing back and forth a LOT, and due to the teleportation mechanic, spatial continuity in the game is warped. Although I would not say the game is not fun, because of all the puzzles, I found it more of a grueling experience than a gleeful one. That said, there are some interesting environments to explore that include an old-fashioned mining town, giant fantastical machines and ancient temples -- if you are willing to put forth the effort to unlock them.","Jun 27, 2017 at 6:24 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:45:50.764330,Satconcook,Myst in VR,"The beautiful visuals, deep mystyrious story and even the full motion video clips of the actors in the game are so much like the original Myst that it is almost like we just jumped into the screen and weren't locked to specific movement points like the old games. There are times that it gets boring and frustrating as you can't seem to find what the next thing to do is, but I remember having the same problem back in the day of playing Myst and Riven.

One thing I realized is that you can't really treat this like your most common VR games. You have to realize that this is pretty much a PC game ported into VR. The interactions are limited, only specific objects are interactable and you will feel like you prevented yourself from progressing, only to find out later something else will happen.

The game froze, crashed, and at times messed with vertical height in game. Sometimes to the point that I had to CTR+ALT+DEL out of it. Also, the only hint to do something from C.W. is repeated to the point that you feel you are still missing something and not at all helpful. Also, unless you look it up, there are 2 endings that you would never know there was a choice to make to change it.

Still, loved the nostalgic feeling of playing a game I so enjoyed and this one to match. A shame there is not any really reason to play it again now that I am done.","May 15, 2017 at 10:32 AM",4, 5,

The real excitement begins once you realize there are other worlds out there that you can travel to, and the graphics of the worlds get increasingly better. 

The game does require you to build a mental map of the worlds to be effective at solving the puzzles. While initially your role is more about exploring and pressing buttons, once you make some progress you are required to find increasingly increative solutions. 

I've spent hours trying to solve one puzzle without feeling tired, and the beauty of the worlds keep inspiring you to crack the puzzles.","May 8, 2017 at 5:56 AM",5, 5,

It needs a patch it totally ruined my experiance so will be playing with a controller or desktop mode.

2022-05-28 18:45:53.949809,thePR0M3TH3AN,Looks great but has many issues!,"First off the game looks amazing in VR and that makes the issues that I have with it particularly frustrating. The major issue is that the touch controls are not implemented properly all around. The hands are WAY to big and are at a weaird angle. Also, the triggers don't activate the pointer fingers correctly like in other games. Both triggers and grips activate the ""grip"" action which just feels weird. When trying to do an action in the game (like pull a lever or open a door) the game literally chops off the players hands and anchors it to the lever or door knob like its no longer a part of your body. Its very damaging to the immersion. Also the game is poorly optimized and runs terribly on the GTX 970. And one last complaint. If you are going to add Oculus Touch controller support to the game then everyday objects laying around the floors and shelves should be interactable. Its frustrating to walk into a room full of stuff and not be able to interact with any of it.","Apr 15, 2017 at 3:02 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 18:45:57.030569,DJ_Killmore,Too many bugs for price,"I am a HUGE fan of the Myst series and fell in love with it in the 90s, so I was SUPER excited for this game in VR. However, considering the $30 price tag and the fact that I got stuck in some rocks in the first 5mins of game play, I was extremely let down. Not to mention the distance in the game is rather poor. VERY choppy and blurry.

I'll follow up by saying I have NO IDEA how to 'job cost' a video game, but when you compare less expensive titles and how solid they are, it's easy to expect more.

In addition, I'm running an AMD octo-core with 32gig RAM and a GTX-1080icx FTW-2, with w/ OCULUS CV, so my computer is no 'slouch'. 

The 'up-close' graphics are amazing, but as another reviewer mentioned, there's so many objects that aren't interactable, combined with the poor 'depth of field', it definitley takes you out of the experience.

Hopefully, there can be updates, but until then, you're better off waiting for a price drop OR just play the NON-VR version.","Apr 27, 2017 at 3:16 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:45:57.046526,HarmlesssPotato,Great so far!,"This game is very immersive and reminiscent of Myst. My only complaint so far is that the touch support is clearly ported from vive. This game does not utilize the capacitive buttons so your hands are always open flat unless you are pressing down a button. What I find interesting is that the reviews on steam are all complaining about the poor performance on high end machines, but I am running this on a GTX960, 3.60GHz i7, and 8gb of ram with very few framerate hiccups. I can't wait to sink more time into this game.","Apr 12, 2017 at 7:12 AM",4, 3,

So I may be a bit biased but there is nothing else in the world like a Cyan Puzzle Game. The VR is done flawlessly now that touch control has been implemented. An occassional hiccup now and then and trying to get the fine print on some of the in game reading material can be frustrating but this represents a very small part of the experience. Otherwise, it runs smoothly and creates an atomosphere unmatched by any other game I've played on Oculus. It is also one of the only ""full"" game experiences I've found compared to alot of these other rift games that feel almost like tech demos.","Mar 24, 2017 at 1:39 PM",5, 7,

I really didn't think I would like to play another puzzle game, but gave it a try anyway and am glad I did.  I haven't finished it yet, but it has now become a favorite, and I will be looking for more like it.  I find that the full immersion takes it to a whole new level where Myst never really could.  The Myst games became monotonous (unfun) puzzle solving to me after a while, whereas so far this is more like being immersed in a real world with a mission, where puzzles are means to an end.  I think it really has a alot to do with the VR aspect. The teleportation took some getting used to, but I now have no problem with it.  No game is for everyone, but if you don't like puzzle games, I suggest giving it a try anyway if it's on sale.  If you do already like them then it's a must.","Mar 17, 2017 at 6:28 AM",5, 4,

This is the only game that has done that to me, I think it's a frame rate issue.  I've tried messing with the detail settings but honestly I can't really notice a frame rate difference between low and high settings. Even on low it can stutter at times.  Puzzles are mostly straight forward and not too difficult to figure out but some I had to google.  I agree with some that the world feel dead, almost like you're frozen in time.  I was disappointed for example you can't enter that first house.  I really wanted to like this game but it's just lacking something compared to Myst.  And you basically stay in the same area a very long time and unless I'm missing something the entire area you are allowed to walk around in is pretty small.
