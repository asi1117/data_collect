2022-05-28 18:49:31.470020,WrothBog,Pretty accurate physics,"I'm playing the quest 2 version for the freedom to do an actual 4 step approach. once you get the ball speed dialled in it's a pretty cool little training tool.

creating your own bowling gear on the quest 2 is much harder than it needs to be because transferring images to a quest 2 is painful. maybe the next update could include some more default images.

the bowling ball release needs to have an ""A"" or ""X"" option. you don't grip a ball with your fingers so both grip and trigger are bad options, and worse they're both analogue so there's a delay. your thumb exiting the ball is the release so it makes sense for letting go of A or X to fulfill that role.

lastly a free play/training option for people who are just practising and don't care about scores. bowling alleys usually offer time based practise sessions.

apart from those three things i enjoy this game for practise purposes. especially visualising the oil patterns.",Jan 15 at 8:23 PM,4, 22,

2022-05-28 18:49:31.515898,omni_shanker,FUN!,"This game is EXTREMELY FUN. I didn't think bowling could be so fun in VR, you know, because the controllers are so light. Still this is great fun. You can texture your own ball if you want, you can even spin the ball while throwing it down the lane so that it curves like in real life bowling!",Nov 27 at 2:15 PM,5, 5,Thanks!
2022-05-28 18:49:31.531855,dantechristmas,The Dude Abides,This is bowling with impressively true to life physics and everything is totally on you.  If you have enough room you can take a full 5-step approach.  You need to get used to the lack of ball weight but once you get smooth you can get really consistent.  If you top it in real life you'll top it in this game.  Oil patterns are really solid and force you to play many different lines.  I'd love to see tournaments with roll-off finals someday but leagues are cool for now.,Jan 3 at 2:20 PM,5, 0,Thanks for the review and Happy New Year! Next feature update will include a new Tournament Alley and after that we've planning to add real-time tournaments with step-ladder finals.
2022-05-28 18:49:34.659490,WatItDoBabyy,Lack of Crossplay Ruins it!,Not Crossplay with the Quest 2 which makes it very disappointing. If I purchased it on PC Oculus store i should be able to play it on my stand alone Oculus Quest 2 also. NOT GOOD!!!!,"Apr 5, 2021 at 12:13 AM",2, 18,Hi.

2022-05-28 18:49:34.675447,Mr.Pilchuck,"Crappy Mechanics, Not cross developed.","If you have a quest 2 and accidentally buy this on the Rift platform when you are connected via link to the PC, it is not cross developed to be able to play on the quest 2. I was not able to play with my friends who bought it on the quest platform and its the only reason why I bought the game. The mechanics are trash and it is not enjoyable to play at all. Oculus has a terrible return policy for this game. 2 hours or 14 days??? It took me 2 hours alone to realize I couldn't even play with my friends. 
Cross develop and play needs to added to this and every rift s game. Oculus needs to be it's own company. And cut ties with Facebook. All Oculus games need to be cross developed and cross play between rift and quest. Its the SAME COMPANY for f's sake.","Feb 28, 2021 at 5:24 AM",1, 13,Hi.

2022-05-28 18:49:34.690407,Dez1971,Has good potential,Played now and again while it was a single player only game --- Now it is Multi- player it is a good social game -- just needs a bigger player base -- Devs are doing regular updates so expect improvments on gameplay --  8/10 from me,"Jan 25, 2021 at 1:44 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:49:34.706365,Slick1984,VR Bowling,"It says Internet connection required, but the game starts and plays, offline, if single-player local is selected.

This game gets updated a lot. The Dev has shown love for his/her game. Just about anything you could think of, in the way of gameplay, has been addressed.

I see a few people are having difficulty with playing this in their play-space. The Oculus products allow you to select what is front. So a short, wide space can be made to be a long, narrow  space. You can also shorten your approach to just your release step, as your arm swing speed determines the ball speed. The balls have weight.

Since I have tendonitis in my right shoulder and elbow, sometimes I'd rather play left-handed and I do have a left-handed character set up. I'm not very good, yet, but I can still play the game.

I started using a cable management system, somewhat, recently and it makes a big difference in gameplay. By keeping the cable off the floor and from around my legs, I am free of that annoyance and constant awareness of it. It also helps that I don't feel like I'm being pulled down from behind anymore.

In short, great game, caring Dev, lots of updates.

UPDATE - Discovered that the helpful guide (spot marker) is more than a guide. With or without my permission, the ball will go to the ""guide"" and there is nothing to be done otherwise. It took me this long to find out because I would aim at the guide. I tried to leave it in place for a single pin spare attempt and found out quickly that the ball is going to the guide regardless of what I wanted to do. So, who's bowling here? If the ball will not go where I want it to go, I'm not the one bowling. THIS IS A SCAM.

2nd UPDATE - The Dev has responded to my issue with the ""helper"" guide. I have not yet tried it, but I have no reason to doubt the response. I restored my original rating. Thanks for the response.","Jan 1, 2021 at 7:04 AM",4, 6,"Hi. You can switch aim mode from VR Options (press B or menu button when playing -> VR Options). Aim helper does not throw for you, but it helps to throw a bit more precisely towards the aim target. Help has tutorial for Throwing with Aim helper."

But...I have an unusual room configuration where my computer is at the long edge of a very wide room.  

So my VR RoomScale is almost twice as wide as deep.

To Creator, can you please add a 90-degree RoomScale rotate option so I can bowl along the long dimension of my room please? ❤️  Or are there instructions where I can reset to a 90 degree rotation?  Thanks!

EDIT: Dev fix works on Rift but fails on WiFi Quest 2 air link (Streamed via SideQuest Virtual Desktop)
EDIT2: Now works great over WiFi Quest 2 if you do not select ""Center to Play Space"" and you hold Oculus button on Quest 2 controller to reset view along longest dimension of play space.

I appreciate that the app does get updated pretty often, and the physics are above average.  The throwing feels touchier than a Wii, and as a bowler it certainly doesn't feel natural.  The multiplayer animated ragdoll-bowlers and the scary looking alley patrons are a plus to laugh at.  With cross-buy it gets 4 stars, but only 5+ star games are ever worth paying for twice, especially when some really good games are cross-buy.","Sep 17, 2020 at 8:47 AM",2, 11,

Since the last patch I'm going to play this game much more. They have got the physics down and now I love playing this game. It feels just like real bowling now. Great Job!

After that I could not figure out how to play a second string. No way. I finally quit and restarted the game. Still would not play. Tried all the buttons and nothing helped. Started the game again. This time it sent me back to the ""Walk Around with the Thumb Stick"" which I could not get out of. Finally quit. Also, my play area is not very deep and I could not find a way to turn the game 90 degrees so I had enough room to walk and throw the bowl.

The physics just feel right (except it seems next to impossible to get a Brooklyn strike).  The only thing holding this game back (literally) is the cable/tether.  Oh how I wish this game was on Oculus Quest instead.  If you're a bowler, you'll probably love this game...if you can get around the cable.

If you're like me and haven't bowled in a long time, the muscles in your bowling arm are going to make you aware of that fact.  The problem with this game (not a fault of the game itself) is that you need lots of physical space if you want to get the fully immersive experience.  If you don't have the right amount of space, you will smash your hand against things like a wall or a desk (I've done both of those).

2022-05-28 18:49:47.322620,Roc4me,"Great game, but...","Love the game, except for the Aim target.  Having a target is fine, but it shouldn’t have any influence on the ball.  When I bowl, just as in real life, I stand in a particular spot and throw over a particular arrow on the lane depending on the lane conditions.  In this game, the ball heads toward the Aim target no matter where you throw.  I’ve even gone into the VR settings and disabled it, but all that did was make the ball go directly into the left gutter a third of the way down the lane no matter where I throw.  The Aim is horrible and should be able to be turned off completely.  I’ve had it ruin easy shots because it acts as some sort of directional gravity for the ball, which it shouldn’t.  It should only be a target.  I’ve put the Aim right in front of me to the left and wherever I throw the ball it goes immediately to the left.  Also, I wish the scoring would indicate splits like we used to back in the day when keeping score manually.  It explains the scoring better as to why a spare was missed.  And having the ball return behind me, especially on a left lane is very awkward each time.  Plus, occasionally when switching balls, one would fly off the return and disappear into the background to show up again sometime next game maybe, which is bad if that’s the one I want to use.  Wow, so much that should be fixed, but it is the best bowling game I’ve played, so I’ll only knock off one star.","Jun 20, 2019 at 4:19 AM",4, 8,"Hi, and thanks for the feedback! Here are some pointers regarding the issues you mentioned.

- When you throw with Aim disabled, the ball will follow ""the natural throw trajectory"" of your swing, just like in real bowling. If you have problems throwing this way, make sure your sensors can track your hand during the swing. You can see the tracked hand trajectory by enabling it from VR settings. Also be prepared to practice for a while as this is not very easy (just like throwing real bowling isn't -- and getting used to throw with the light weight controller takes time too).

Version 1.6.5 added split indicator to the scorecard.

The ball pickup area is a bit back (like in real bowling) but you can pick up the default ball for the throw by pointing anywhere else than lane and pressing the trigger button -- no need to turn around and go get it from the ball machine."

Even though it's stated that the balls behave differently, as far as I can tell, besides the color there is no difference between them  - but maybe I need to play more.
