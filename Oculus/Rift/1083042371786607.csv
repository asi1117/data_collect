 The game can also be more enjoyable if you have a friend to mess around with. Me and my friends have had lots of fun just messing around in this game.

That does not mean it can't be enjoyable alone, I have had lots of fun experiences in this game alone.

My main focus was understanding what actions, movements, etc... make the user uncomfortable and/or nauseous. This game, somehow, even in its simplest form, makes you really really uncomfortable.

It's for loading up after first contact to get you used to gripping objects with your middle finger. Play it for fifteen minutes and you'll be completely at home with the Touch controllers.
