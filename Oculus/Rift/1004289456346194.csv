Sometimes the grey screens happen out of the blue, or the app just freezes.  Removing the headset and puting it back on always gives a grey screen.  I also don't know what they were thinking combining all the settings into the same screen and having it cover the play funtions.  It use to be so easy to control settings on the fly, now you have to click through multiple screens and tabs.   The new interface is terrible.  I can never understand why developers spend so much time creating a new interface that is worse than the old one.  Just make it run smooth, and not crash.  The new interface just makes the app worse, not better.",Mar 22 at 1:38 PM,2, 8,

It also has some stupid design choices that you have to swallow if you prefer to use it, like always opening browser when you run it, not remember what you were doing. And if any video doesn't play, you're stuck in a menu that tells you to open browser (which it doesn't) to download codex (which it cant use) and you can close this menu so have to reset the whole thing.

2022-05-28 16:22:11.692205,Cenobyte,Nice Video app w/some new issues,"I'll start by saying that this is the probably the most consistent video player with some great features, it does have issues however, especially since the last update... I'm honestly writing this review as a ticket of sorts in hopes of having a couple things fixed. :D

Since the update if you toggle the playback/settings menu it doesnt appear directly in front of you regardless of where youre looking, as it used to, it stays in a fixed spot which you can move around manually.  It was better before this change, from an ease of use standpoint... why not make it an option in settings?  Also, scroll up and down no longer works using the oculus remote up/down button when in the file menu... grabbing the scroll bar with the oculus remote and scrolling with your head is weird.  Finally I've noted videos seem to appear to have sharpness applied out of the gate, matter of fact if you hit default video settings on a newly opened video it actually loses sharpness... that's gotta be a bug?

Update May 11 2019 - The software has improved in some ways and stayed the same in others... it's still my go to video app, so, for that I'm upping my rating a star, the app does what it does well... easy to recommend!

Update Sept 19 2020 - Many of the issues mentioned in my original review(s) have been ironed out after patches and a couple of major updates. While it still has some issues here and there depending on what you're using it for, DeoVR is still my go to video app, and the one I'd recommend to anyone looking for a quality video playback app with some great options!  Upping review to 5 stars... pretty sure this started at 3/5 when I first posted the review a long while ago, so, great work devs! :)

Update Feb 23 2022 - Still my go to app for video, but I needto comment on the latest change to the interface.  The settings are now burried under multiple clicks and one interface. Devs, please allow users to swap between this and the old/last interface, it was MUCH better!",Feb 24 at 11:50 AM,5, 0,

E.g. after i've watched a video and get back to the menu, for whatever reason it automatically scrolls down the list without me doing anything. Don't ask me why, but it does.

And just recently whenever I want to play a video, but it gives me an error code, because some codec is missing, i can't dismiss the error message anymore, i have to close the whole app and restart it, don't ask me why.

BUT it's free, so considering how good, easy and simple it is to use, I can bear a few bugs now and then, I just hope one day they are finally gone, because it's annoying as hell.","Jun 9, 2021 at 12:35 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 16:22:33.836976,innovacy,The BEST player? NO LONGER!!,"UPDATE: Used to be the best, but constant updates with zero value and constant interface changes make it a horrible experience. Why is now everything hidden away behind buttons and can be reached only with more clicks than before? Now, the latest update made it completely useless: Stereo is no longer working for some reason. Thought first it's an issue with Rift on my PC, but then I noticed the same issue on the Quest 2. The player jumps back and forth showing only the left or right eye, depending on how you move your head, never both at the same time as it should - every other app works. Now the player always starts on the web view, which I'm not interested in, and directs me to a specific porn site with no option to turn that off!! What if I want to show something to a certain friend, why should porn be the first they see??? ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCEPTABLE changes from the devs. They too reached the point, wher money becomes more important than the product.

OLD:
I've been looking and looking for the best VR player everywhere. And after trying them all, this one is it!

Besides all the standards than any player has like 180/360/flat and so on, you can also tilt, you can zoom, scale, set height, change vertical and horizontal alignment of stereoscopic effect, you can adjust the player behaviour itself. Best one is: you can use the touch controllers to do all this and also to pause, change play position and a lot more without bringing up the menu. But even if you bring it up, you can control if it stops the 3d effect, if this overlapping causes you nausea or makes it distressing and the best of all it is: The player remembers your individual settings for each and any video you have ever opened, once you have customized the video to fit. You can watch a little bit, go back and watch later more of any video without re-adjusting it.

a few pts for further improvement if you can consider please:
1. i still prefer the zoom and tilt functions to be near the centre so i can see how i am affecting the image.
2. option to disable the auto change of quality when bandwidth is insufficient. possible to allow option of setting a longer buffering period?

2022-05-28 16:23:27.501442,tomprogers,Complete but imperfect,"It works, but it's very obviously a launch-day product. Also, I think it's causing frequently blue-screens-of-death.

The UX needs refinement. The many features people are excited about are almost always buried several clicks away, e.g. the ""Tilt"" control that they show in their marketing materials is 2 clicks in and a razor-thin slider, and you can only fiddle with it while a giantic square menu is blotting out a big part of the video. Same with the controls for the app volume. To reset the VR centerpoint, you have to switch to the Oculus Desktop -- most VR games assign a hotkey to VR-reset because, when you need it, it's that important. Some of the clickables are very small. The timeline scrubber is only 4 or 5px tall, which sometimes means making more than one attempt to grab it. Most of the adjustments you can make are done via the same, very slender sliders, which can make things frustrating. None of those settings are quantified, so you have to eyeball them from video to video if adjustments are necessary.

The VCR controls exist, but could use refinement. The speed of fast-forward and fast-reverse seems to vary based on the length of the video. So, when watching something longer (20-30m), tapping fast-reverse takes you back 1 or 2 whole minutes, instead of e.g. 3 or 5 seconds, which is what things like Netflix and Amazon do with their video controls.

I can't tell if this app is actively maintained, or abandonware. Current version is 0.9x. But there's not a lot of competition out there, certainly not for $0.

I would like to see a v2.

And, as I mentioned, I think this app is causing frequent stop code 0x124 (a rare, special hardware error). I think this because I play lots of VR games with no such problem, and because in attempting to remedy the problem I've updated drivers and firmware for every chipset and every piece of hardware in my PC, and only DeoVR causes the BSOD. It happens unpredictably, but certainly more than once every 10 minutes of watching.","Sep 8, 2019 at 3:27 PM",4, 1,"All the controls you mentioned can be used with a controller (Rift and gamepad) and are customisable, including recenter.

As a retired software developer with 40 years of development and software testing experience it is easy for me to see the quality in this application.

I know you just want USEFUL feedback so I am just going to relay MY issues  noticed using Windows 10, Oculus Rift, with Hand Controllers on MY pc :

* The Browser returns an error when going to other sites other than yours.
* The browser remembers MY sites in a drop down list but, the sites in the list do 
not respond with the rift hand controller. 
* The Video Sharpness control is a great asset to your application.  It is hard for 
ME to control with the rift's hand controller.  I recommend a decrement (-) button on left end of the slider control and an increment(+) button on the right end of the slider control which will allow the smallest change (+/-) in sharpness when clicked.
* The app does NOT recognize video file extension  .MP4.  However, It DOES recognize .mp4.  This MAY be happening on other UPPER case extensions which are legal, by the way, in Windows.
 
These are just personal issues.  You do great work with Unity.  I know, I've played with it :)","Feb 18, 2019 at 3:19 AM",5, 5,

Original post 1-3-19: I am getting the error that tells me to install LAV from the browser.

VR media was on a seperate hard drive. After reinstall my permissions were all over the place.  Media would not play in Potplayer/VLC nor would the properties populate. No permission? No play!
