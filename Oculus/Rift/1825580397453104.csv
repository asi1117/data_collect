2022-05-28 17:11:29.857684,mbartke,Camping Fun!,"First, the downside: I can't run the high quality mode and from what I've seen, that is a problem for everyone. I'd like to see what that looks like.

The Good: I was always a fan of FMV games and this is a good one. It is a little pixelated, but not that bad. You do get the feeling that you're in the woods and it is a nice Satantist-filled escape from reality. I enjoy it. I take off my headset after an hour of trying to flee the madness and am saddened to see that I'm in my dark basement with nothing trying to kill me. 

The Other: 
The map is basically useless... just a heads up for those trying to rely on it. I guess it would be too easy if you could follow the map.","May 17, 2019 at 6:01 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:11:29.871647,FastLawyer,"Got it for .99 cents, devil of a deal","So yeah I got this on an Oculus sale for .99 cents USD and it's an absolute steal at that price. I had actually bought this on the Oculus Go and the quality there (even on high quality) was very bad. I'm happy to report that on my 1060GTX and on High quality, this looks very good on the Oculus Rift. It is fun choosing the different paths and trying to escape with your life. There are 13 different endings, but 12 deaths and only 1 way out. Cheesy horror fun!","Jun 20, 2019 at 5:36 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:11:29.886607,OraXSerrata,Why not fix a known problem?,"Game content is good but just like others who have complained, I meet requirements but get a black screen if I try to view in high definition. It seems like developers are just to complacent to deal with the complaints of their patrons without going through the hassle of confronting known issues. If that's the case then drop the high def feature and truthfully advertise it as a game that can only be played in standard resolution and adjust its price accordingly. VR consumers are becoming fed up with the lazy approach and empty promises.","Mar 7, 2019 at 8:40 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 17:11:33.026210,ericsenecal,"entertaining,","it reminds me a bit like the blaywitch project. A skip scene could be nice... when you die you need to redo all the cut scene. But still very nice experience.

12 way to die, 1 way out :)","Oct 26, 2018 at 8:16 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 17:11:33.041169,Clu,Unique/refreshing/good video quality!!,"This was a very unique experience. The video quality was really good compared to everything else ive tried on oculus. The fact you had a compass and a map done digital that you could pull up at any time was very cool. You have 4 paths to take after many of the videos and it tracks where you have been on the map. When you pick the wrong path and die its pretty scary i was facing away from the demon heard him turned around and he was in my face (great jump scares). I hope you guys continue to make more of these as i love interactive videos as much as i do games if not more.

The only issue i had was in 1 of the clips after it was over the arrows didnt appear so i double tapped the oculus menu and it worked without the need to reset. It could ruin the immersion for some but it wasnt bad just thought i would let you know. Its the one where he is laying on the tree trunk.","May 25, 2018 at 11:07 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 17:11:33.055132,Burn242,Great FMV game,"Always enjoyed FMV games and this is great. Good amount of scares and was very entertaining. I did have the black screen issue with the high quality on 1080 GTX but choosing normal quality fixed the issue. Hope to see more like this in the future, thanks!","Jun 1, 2018 at 9:19 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:11:33.070092,alex864,Can't get into the game (black screen),"So i bought the game some hours ago but can't play, i start the game and then i only hear footsteps but no image like is black screen, all my other game are working fine, how do i fix it please?","May 27, 2018 at 5:32 AM",2, 4,"If you try to play on High Quality and don't have the latest generation NVIDIA graphics cards (1070 or higher) it will load a black screen.
