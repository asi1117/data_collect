2022-05-28 17:20:04.037437,ramesh.jagann,Best Graphics on a roller coaster,"I have many roller coaster app... this is the best... Well done... for the graphics and scenery.  I DO NOT AGREE with other reviewers with the ride being slow.  It was a very thoughtful to make it slow so we enjoy the scenery.   THUMBS UP.    

On the flip side,  JUST ANIMATE THE RIVER ... it seemed like ROCK in some areas.

Also ADD MORE VIBRANT  AMBIENT NOISE AND NATURAL SOUNDS , CAVE SOUNDS ETC.     

Overall , great effort and looking forward for more rides.","Mar 8, 2021 at 11:21 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 17:20:04.097278,nightcat.mau,Khajiit Kitten Coaster,"Feel like a wee kitten on the world's tiniest coaster. You'll see pretty much the same statue repeated everywhere on a slow and tiny coaster. Could have been dubbed a train sim as it moves so slowly and there is no mystery to uncover. It is kind of nice and not the worst coaster I've ever ridden, but the ending needs work. It seems scaled very small, and I mean toddler sized. It is charming in it's own way, like an Elder Scrolls fan wanted a Khajiit tumble bug ride and it does that just fine. But now we need fine feline NPCs, yes?","Apr 19, 2018 at 12:13 PM",3, 6,
