2022-05-28 19:25:22.711220,VibrationsOfDoom,Needs quest 2 port!!,"Amazing game for the price! Bought this a looong time ago and can't believe I didn't write a review for it... It is a great game; like someone mentioned below, it's like what the Bishop Of Battle videogame would look like... Run through what looks like a master control program like in Tron, shooting basically anything that shoots back... Beautiful graphics, and great run and gun tactics... Might remind you of a less crowded Robotron, don't know what else to compare it to really... Beautifully drawn... Guns on the walls tracking you, levels that scale up and down, find keys, almost like a Sci-fi rogue shooter with much less emphasis on the D&D aspects and top notch action...

Can we haz a Quest 2 port PLEASE??? Wanna store this on the Quest 2 headset... Developers aren't listening it seems, since there's a huge bucket list of games I want to be installable on the Quest 2...",Nov 28 at 3:43 PM,4, 1,Ha I actually didn't see this review until just now because I am actually focused on a Quest port.  Once that's done I am looking forward to adding more content. Glad you like it.
2022-05-28 19:25:22.726180,rchrdcrg,Awesome game!,"I wanted this game from the first moment I saw a video of it. Once I got it, though, I wasn't quite sure how I felt... at first I was a bit underwhelmed by the gameplay and overwhelmed by the insane graphics, even thought about refunding it, but it started to grow on me especially after a few playthroughs, and now I find myself returning to this review again and again to express how much I love this game! Never judge a procedural game based on just one or two plays. This one really grows on you over time, and I find myself playing more and more. If you've ever seen ""The Bishop of Battle"", this game definitely feels like how the filmmakers would've envisioned games in the future. It's intense in every way and so so satisfying.","Oct 27, 2020 at 2:33 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:25:22.741141,808Exile,"Good game, more than worth the price ;-)","Met the developer at the 2019 Classic Games Fest in Austin, (real nice guy) and got to try this out on a Rift headset and really liked it. I didn't own a VR headset yet and just recently bought the Quest and went out and bought the game. I am playing this using Oculus Link. It's a fun game, but a word of caution if you’re subject to car sickness or get sea sick you might want to play this with care. I'm a seasoned diver and have spent many hours on boats in rough seas and I don’t typically get sea sick, but I found myself getting a little queasy while moving, maybe I just need to get the movement down better though. Definitely give this a try and support the developer. Also, this title has great potential as a standalone running on the Quest and maybe even the Oculus Go.","Jan 6, 2020 at 6:48 AM",5, 2,Hiya yeah Classic Game Fest was awesome.  Glad you decided to take the VR plunge.  Oh and don't worry about VR sickness it gets us all in the beginning.  This will be coming out of early access with more content soon.  Then mobile VR is something I have been messing around with in Unity.
2022-05-28 19:25:22.757098,Xijaa,A full-fledged roguelike/lite experience,"Gotta say... I'm loving this so far.  I'm still kinda new to VR, but this is easily one of my favorite games on it so far.  I'm a huuuuge fan of roguelikes/lites or whatever bloody term is being used lately.  It's my main genre, easily the sort of game I play the most.  But finding something like that in VR has been tough.

This really scratches that itch though.  Pretty much everything I expect in the genre is here (including high difficulty!).  All set in a glorious Tron-inspired world that is a joy to explore.  

Be warned though that you really have to have gotten your ""VR legs"" before playing this one.  No teleportation here, and no snap-turning either.  Overall, movement feels very good, nice and smooth and easy to control, and the manual aiming really adds to the experience with the touch controllers (you have the option for head-aiming if you'd like).  

One thing I dont like (and this is something that always bothers me in this genre) is that there doesnt appear to be a way to get an explanation of what any given item does once you've picked it up.  Again, it's not a problem unique to this game... lots of games in this genre pull this one... but I find it very annoying nonetheless.  A function in the pause menu to just check items currently held and see descriptions would be just super.

But anyway, if you like that type of game, and if you think you're ready to handle the sort of movement that this game uses (and if you're ready for the difficulty!)... yeah, absolutely pick this one up.  I know I'm going to be constantly coming back to it.  Totally love it.","Dec 25, 2018 at 2:31 PM",5, 1,"Thank you so much for the in-depth review.  You captured exactly what I was aiming for in describing B99.  My goal is in the grand roguelike tradition is to continue to add more variety, content, quality of life, and polish year after year so that someone can come back to it later and find more to explore and new wild experiences.  I will take your suggestion on an inventory description system to heart.  Thanks again."
2022-05-28 19:25:22.773055,Azrayel,"Challenging, fast paced, hypercolor",This game is paced well but get ready for a challenge. The enviroments make you feel like you're in a classic arcade game and it ramps up like one too. I spent a lot of time playing games like this on classic systems. It's awesome to be inside one in VR. The dev is very responsive and makes regular updates. I look forward to the new levels!,"Dec 4, 2018 at 2:57 AM",5, 2,Thanks for the kind words.  Still lots more things being added leading up to coming out of early access in June.  I'm going to fill it to the brim with content.
2022-05-28 19:25:25.894706,Captain_Howdy,Start menu is a bit confusing,"A really addictive game, and no motion sickness when sitting down with head-aiming (standing might be easier with manual aiming but I haven't tried that yet)

Dev,

I had some trouble figuring out how to start the game, the menu is a bit ... confusing
I mean with that, that the menu more or less gave me the impression that I was shown a few options and where it says ""Touch"" I just asumed it was an indicator so people would know what controler was refered to
So I chose ""on"" for head tracking and looked for the ""exit menu"" button (like the ""back"" button you use later on)

Maybe the ""Start"" button should be in this menu instead of in the next menu, it's more intuitive that way
Also, since the game isn't mouse controled the ""double shot"" selection isn't helping either

If you would have put the ""xbox"" and the ""touch"" fields below the ""choose"" button it would have been way more obvious that we're suposed to actually shoot at the controler we want to use
(Most games don't even ask, they just DETECT which one is used)

I'm now going to try out the game, but you already lost 1 star
Never piss a customer off even before they can try out your product, I had almost simply gone for a refund and shop for some other games

I'll keep that final star until the menu is a bit more intuitive ;)

update, and now the update won't install, but I am almost certain that is a bug on Oculus' or my AV's side","Sep 4, 2018 at 10:43 PM",5, 1,"Thanks for the feedback, really.  The menus are sort kinda an evolution from pre touch controllers so they just kept building up from customer requests.  The Menus are getting an overhaul when it comes out of early access and all features have been implemented.   Suffer with me a little longer I got a lot of fun content to add and then a big focus on a redone polished finalized user interface."
2022-05-28 19:25:25.909666,HoodyNynja,A Sleeper Hit!,"Full Review - https://youtu.be/Pzp4xyA2Ceo

An immersive shooter with an amazing feel and theme of being inside 80's VR.  Imagine the world of Tron, but with more vibrant colors and effects that actually add to gameplay, rather than distract from it.

There's challenge to the game, but not at a frustrating level since you notice your skills improving with each ""dungeon"" run,

The developer is great to interact with, and is constantly adding worthwhile content and features, while listening to and implementing changes when relevant.","Jun 5, 2018 at 9:48 AM",5, 4,Love the review and channel.   I will keep adding to it monthly til I have that ridiculous level of content.
2022-05-28 19:25:25.925623,Valve_Index,most visually entertaining game ever,"This is the most visually entertaining video game experience I ever had. :D
Nice trance music too.","Jun 28, 2018 at 11:28 PM",5, 0,Thanks for the kind words.  Look forward to future updates.  The more optimization I do the more performance budget I have too keep improving the visual and audio experience.
2022-05-28 19:25:25.940583,HiThere_,Simply AMAZING,"Once you've completed the short Tutorial (recommended) and mastered your first floor(s), this game turns out to be FREAKING GOOD, with an amount of freedom, diversity and replayability that most VR titles can only dream of. It's a challenging rogue-like with a single or unlimited lives mode, that has FAST free locomotion, multi-path floor exploration, chests, traps, upgrades, treasure rooms, mystery rooms, save points between floors, a wide range of enemies, mini-boss, floor boss and more...","Apr 25, 2018 at 11:28 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:25:25.955543,jayf95,"Really fun game, definitely worth it","Definitely play the tutorial first, but once you get the controls down its a really fun game!","May 9, 2018 at 11:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:25:29.060239,Fguillotine,I'm in love with this game.,"Art work is insine and really fun to play, especialy the rogue mode. I still can't believe i only pay 0,99 for this. You are awesome.","Mar 29, 2018 at 7:47 PM",5, 3,"Thanks for the encouragement.  Good to hear you are enjoying rogue mode, permadeath make the battles more intense. More stuff coming every month."
2022-05-28 19:25:29.076196,negulici007,A hidden gem !,"With a beautifull immersive neon world, accurate controls and fast gameplay, this game is a blast ! Thanks devs.","Mar 29, 2018 at 4:55 AM",5, 3,Thank you I spent a lot of time trying to get the feel and balance right.  More content coming every month so if you wait a few months and return to it then it will feel fresh again.
2022-05-28 19:25:29.091156,VJFranzK,"Retro Cool Graphics, Exploring Battle","The graphics look like Tron, Battlezone, or other early 3d styles.  They are really flashy!  perhaps too much so - it's hard to tell the enemies from the equally bright background.  ( perhaps the render style could be adjusted? )
The play action isn't really explained, but watch the video and you'll get it.
It would be cool to have Touch controller support - as it is, you aim by moving your head, move and fire with the Xbox control.","May 21, 2017 at 12:10 AM",4, 2,Full Touch Controller Support (7/29/17) is now in the game as well as a Tutorial (6/5/17) under the Combat Sim Tab from the main menu. Enjoy.
2022-05-28 19:25:29.107114,xtrader,Roguelike Techno-Rave Shooter,"Not for the faint of heart. Immerse yourself in a pschyadelic world full of colors and shapes, while you blast your way through a maze of mobs. If you suck at video games, this game is not for you.","May 7, 2017 at 3:30 AM",5, 5,"Ha thanks.  Though it is a roguelike and meant to be hard. Easy mode is in the game now.  On Easy mode you take less damage, gain more health from health packs, and the death penalty is going back one floor, but you get too keep everything you have picked up."
