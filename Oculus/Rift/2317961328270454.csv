2022-05-28 17:17:59.471607,NaronWayne,What a waste,"This was the first of the series where I was hoping it was going to end and thankfully it was short! The tie fighter scene was honestly the only cool thing in this game (the perspective and true scale you get is amazing honestly). Im glad I finished the series but I do not believe I will be replaying it unless it is to unlock the home items. Try it for yourself you may enjoy it, but hard core star wars fans beware this is not the game your looking for.",Feb 18 at 6:46 AM,2, 4,
2022-05-28 17:17:59.486567,Natn8r,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!!!!,"The best vr game I've ever played.
Pros:
+Amazing force powers that make you feel like a jedi master!
+Amazing story mode that you can replay multiple times with legendary characters that stay with you
+Don't even get me started on the lightsaber dojo.  They perfected lightsaber and force combat in this game. I have at least 100+ hours in this and have all the lightsabers
+Requirments for pc are NOT demanding AT ALL. I have a terrible hp laptop and it can run with no lag at all (intel i5 GTX 1040 8 gigs of ram and ssd upgrade)
+Graphics are absolutly amazing for the specs it requires

Cons:
-Throwing lightsabers is a bit overpowered when dual weilding
-Thermal Detenators and blasters are kinda useless
-Third reason cuz I dont like only thinking of 3 cons lol",Nov 22 at 5:00 AM,5, 34,

2022-05-28 17:17:59.529452,Celticpred,The final game perfects the combat,"The final game of the Vader Immortal trilogy perfects the combat by adding blasters and thermal detonators as playable weapons. This also adds way more options in the Dojo along with the best rewards from the movies like Kylo Ren's lightsaber, Luke's lightsaber and more! If you are a Star Wars just finish this game and play the dojo, each game's dojo is a different challenge and you will feel like a true Jedi!

2022-05-28 17:18:09.010094,C2ThaMax,Dojo All the Way,"So storyline is great and all. Really loved it truly. But the Dojo is what will occupy you for hours and hours. It's got a ton of different sabers to unlock which is cool and overall is just super fun. And 40 or so levels that are challenging enough the first time through to make you really earn it. Also, it's Star Wars and it has lightsabers. That's really all you need to know. The lightsabers could have been more powerful; you end up using different means to destroy the stronger bots because the lightsabers just take too long. And the remotes are a pretty dull enemy. It would have been a lot better to have a different environment or two to choose from. But overall it's a must play. It's like $15 and you can probably play 15 hours in just the Dojo alone. Unless you're some sort of natural Jedi Master and just plough your way through. Then my hat is off to you. 

I hate most when you take off the headset and have to actually walk over to things to pick them up. That's just the freaking worst.","Nov 15, 2020 at 11:20 AM",4, 42,

The story is great, although short and I would have loved a longer story. However the Dojo makes up for the short story with hours of gameplay. The lightsaber combat is the first system I've seen thats smooth, you can perry well, not many bugs. I love the addition of force and throwing lightsabers. Overall an amazing game and if your considering it and have the money I would buy it, out of all the 20-40 dollar games I have I play this one a lot more.

It was again too short, but again, the quality is there. 

I want to be clear, it was fun to be ""in"" a Star Wars ""movie""(?) and to interact as a character. Maya Rudolf was enjoyable as ZO-E3. But, it was not worth the $29.97.","Nov 19, 2020 at 7:47 AM",3, 16,

2022-05-28 17:18:12.176625,NKiel,What could improve,"If you buy this game don't even go play the story mode go for the dojo. If you don't know what dojo is it's a training area where there's different levels and it's really well made. Best part of the game 100%

Spoilers:
Anakin or Darth Vader tries to bring back padme, sometimes in the game you see him talking to padme which was really cool. What would've been really sick was padme being reborn and was able to physically move. She would then storm over to Anakin and hug him or something but instead you destroy the thing that was meant to bring padme back to life again. You don't even get to fight Vader fully and kill him with your lightsaber. 

Maybe my standards were too high for this game since the only other story vr games I've played is half life alyx and boneworks. Both really good games and if you have a powerful enough pc then buy both. 

The price should be lower for all games. 10 bucks is just way to high. I'm not done with this game, I will come back to the dojo however.","Dec 12, 2020 at 10:22 PM",3, 2,

Force controls were much much better than when they were introduced in the second one. The fight with Vader was... anti climatic. It was very short and should have been the high point in the series. However, I think all the other features of the game make up for it. This one feels the most like a game, where the others felt more movie than game.

I beat the story very quickly. Even though the story is short, its fun. I only have 2 problems with this game. 1 it felt very restrictive in the action bits, by making you stand still. 2 I wish there was more lightsaber on lightsaber combat. In the story there is only one part with you fighting someone else with a lightsaber and in the dojo, sure there are the bots but you also have to deal with the other enemies. I just wish there was a 1 on 1 lightsaber fighting dojo. So overall, its worth $10 becuase of the dojo.","Dec 7, 2020 at 3:38 AM",4, 2,

As usual good SW atmopsphere, graphics and sound. Story is background this time, action is primary focus of this episode.
Worth of buying as final part of series.

Frankly i can't percieve three Vader episodes as separate games. It is solid story, one game. The game is simple enough, suits perfectly for new VR gamers or casuals. However it definitely worth of buying, expecially if you know SW universe and like it.
I hope we'll get next episodes someday.","May 31, 2020 at 7:05 AM",4, 22,

2022-05-28 17:18:21.686190,kriegler630,There is a huge amount of opportunity.,"I feel like the Lightsaber Dojo is something they really need to focus on more of, it's great and fun. But there is soooo much more they could do with it. Allow for more customization. Just for example allow us to fight Saber wielding enemies where if you get hit once your dead, allow for different difficulties. 

Make really fun modes with in dojo, like Reflect- where you have to try and reflect as many blaster shots as you can and allow multiple enemies to fire at you at the same time. 

Make a force powers mode where you really hone in on how to use your stander force abilites. 

A mode where they have droids that fire blaster rounds and the saw droids come at you...

This is a huge foundation for what could simply be the best VR expierence to date. They just really need to take advantage of it, the dojo can only go so far before it gets to boring. im at like round 40 and it's just starting to get meh... 

Give the players more control over how they want their saber to look, which colours to use. I personally would want to use a Red saber with a Yellow or orange saber. But the game doesn't let me.

The user interface is a good mention because it's simple and to the point with cool user customizations. Each individual game might lack content, but put together they make for a really stunning interactive VR movie/game? 

The Dojo
The real game is in the Dojo where you train and train and train your jedi and lightsaber weilding powers. You can really tell they put a lot of thougt into the mechanics of it. From using the force to the random opponents/challenges/extras you get from completing it all. What's the entire point of it all though besides being an arcade game? The Dojo could be maximized in so many ways with online challenges or connecting/battling other people. 

Overall I think $30 might have been alright for the price. I would've felt better paying $20 for a movie and arcade game though. If you're a star wars fan I would suggest getting all 3 and enjoying being a part of the universe. If you are just looking to have fun and play as a Jedi then just pay $10 for the 3rd installment and have fun killing storm troopers.","May 11, 2020 at 3:04 AM",4, 1,

While I enjoyed the 3rd part as well it was too short and seemed too easy. Vader was too easily defeated here and being saved by NPC at the last second just before Vader would kill you ruined the end for me. In the end, you achieve your goal with Vader...... welll kinda helpless which ruins the mystique around his lordship.

He had a menacing air in the first two games and in the third? The saber duel is lacklustre, youre saved by plot armour bs and the story is far too short.

The dojo is epic though so I'll still get my moneys worth... but I was here for the story and this final portion of an otherwise great trilogy left me disappointed.

I am, however, encouraged for the future. I would love to see the Star Wars universe be developed into a full fledged VR game in the future. Hell even have an online PvP arena would be great!","Apr 2, 2020 at 2:47 PM",3, 3,

Slash a few things with a saber, cool, 5 mins max. Heres 30 more minutes of more pointless dialogue. Repeat that for 3 episodes and BOOM, you got Vader Immortal. The only positive thing I have to say about this game is that it looks nice visually. This whole game reminds me of those arcade shooters with the plastic guns.

The training dojo is where you will spend more of your time. This mode offers a fun and challenging wave shooter exdperience where you have a blaster, a lightsaber and some grenades. You also have to force at your disposal where you can hurl enemies around. The lightsaber feels and sounds incredibly authentic, making the melee fights in the game feel weighty and satisfying. With 100 waves and over a dozen different enemy types there's plenty of challenges to adapt to. 
I only wish there was a larger map variety, like Hoth or Atop a temple in Yavin. A progression system where you can earn and equip certain force powers/blasters would be an amazing addition as well.

I understand why everyone praises this episode, the dojo actually requires some skill now, but there are aspects it could improve upon. The only new enemy you face here is stormtroopers, and it's cool, but only the first few times you fight them. There is a boss and one glorified cutscene at the end. 

I don't want to kill Vader, but there should be some sense of danger in that fight. Darth Vader should be a hard boss fight, but the fight lacks spirit in this. The explosion and time freeze make it feel too easy. I consider myself a huge Star Wars fan and it was cool to see and fight Vader, but it should have been difficult. There should have been a sense of danger throughout the whole series. I'm a bit disappointed. Sorry. 

PS. This doesn't change the rating at all, but ILM, please patch so that Vader is the final wave in the dojo. That was a missed opportunity. Am disappointed in that too, but that didn't change the rating I gave it.","Jan 28, 2020 at 1:06 PM",3, 3,

Playing on Rift CV1
Ryzen 2700X
GeForce 1660GTX
16GB DDR4 3000mhz

I have episode 1 & 2, but i'm writing my first review on this game for Episode 3.

First off, the sound and visuals are amazing. So many games have very bland graphics to allow for better performance, but after seeing the graphics in this game and it's perfect performance, there is no excuse that other games can't compete. 

The sound is amazing and absolutely adds to the feeling of BEING in the SW world. Very authentic sounds and i'd expect nothing less from ILM. There's nothing like holding a lightsaber next to your head and hearing the hum.

The story mode is short, but these are EPISODES, so that's completely fine. $10 per episode is good. If they make one more that's $40 for a great game. Let's hope they make more than 4.

The story is great. It's different and interesting to see more about Vader's thirst for more power. It does seem more like a guided tour than a campaign mode, but i'm good with that.

Now for the best part (for me) The Lightsaber Dojo.  This episode adds Dual wield sabers (FINALLY), more colors and hilts. It also adds the E-11 Blaster Rifle and Thermal detonators (only at Dojo level 10 so far, maybe there is more to come?) More enemies in the form of new training remotes and stormtroopers (still more to come at higher lvl?)

I'd really like to see all of this technology and effort put into a larger fully fledged FPS in the SW universe. Possibly multiplayer saber battles. Although VR is still kind of niche, if something larger was produced with this kind of love, i think more would get into VR.

I do wish there was a way to run this game in Mixed Reality for video, like Beat Saber. Maybe something to think about adding devs?","Nov 22, 2019 at 9:41 AM",4, 49,

The biggest issues I have with the game is the scenes in darkness feel a bit too dark and hard to see, and that using the force isn't very reliable, especially in high end Dojo rounds.

I'm stuck on round 45/50, and the only reason I'm having issues is because I can stand looking right at a blaster for 25 seconds and have my hand ready to force pull it to me, and nothing will happen, leaving me way too vulnerable and often causing me to die, I just feel it should be a bit more sensetive to where my arms are pointing to actually grab things? This happens to me in Vader Immortal 2 as well. It's not a case of me not holding the button long enough, but more that I don't even get the prompt to start with. If the force were a bit more fleshed out in this way, I'd really be enjoying it.

I don't know... It was basically just walking a linear path and blocking blaster shots for half an hour with no story whatsoever.
Meanwhile it locked you in position every two seconds and limited your interactions with the world. It's a VR GAME, not a movie. Let me interact with stuff. Let me move. I want to dive into the Star Wars universe and play a role in it. I don't want to be shown the Star Wars universe and be forced into a strict role and position in it.
The game apparently doesn't even care if you play properly. I completely messed up in the final boss fight. The fight just progressed as if I was slaying it.

A Star Wars VR Game - Sounds like a dream come true. You could explore planets, fly in a starship, become a jedi, become a sith, build a lightsaber, fight with a blaster, move as agile as force users are usually portraied to move, have a great story. The possibility are endless and sound amazing.
This ain't that. This is a clunky experience that doesn't let you do ANYTHING for most of the time, that moves you through a very simple linear story.

So in conclusion: If you're a Star Wars fan, obviously you're gonna play this. And you should. It's a Star Wars VR Game afterall. And I really hope there will be more. But I also hope that new games will be made by people who understand the spirit of VR and live up to it. This does not.

2022-05-28 17:18:59.460159,MacMillan333,"Anticlimactic, but dojo is still awesome","You can finally fight Vader, but it's very scripted and underwhelming. As with the previous episodes, I'm buying this game for the dojo, and it's freaking awesome.

This time they finally added everything I could ask for: dual-wield sabers, bidirectional sabers, blasters and thermal detonators. Back in Episode II I complained that the Force was overpowered, and I'm glad to see that this time they balanced it with two more equally efficient ways to kill enemies.

First is the blaster. Some enemies can resist the Force for a few seconds, but with the blaster you can make it as fast as you can shoot. It's powerful too, as very few enemies can withstand more than 3 shots. That's not to say the blaster is absolutely overpowered, because you still have to aim well, and there's limited ammo, so you may need to Force-grab additional blasters from Stormtroopers.

Second is dual-wielding sabers. With one lightsaber you get the same defensive capabilities as always, but now with a second saber, you have the freedom to slice stunned enemies twice as fast, or immediately deliver a riposte with your spare hand after a parry, or hold both sabers up for an impenetrable guard, or throw and recall the second saber to attack and defend at the same time.

All tools considered I have developed three distinctive fighting styles: defensive saber + Force, defensive saber + blaster, dual sabers. They each have their pros and cons: the Force can take out enemies in pairs, but it takes time; blasters are fast, but there's ammo anxiety, and it can be difficult to grab additional blasters when surrounded; dual-wielding is agile, but it's less efficient for ranged enemies. Because of this I actually have to swap fighting styles back and forth to adapt to the ever-changing enemy layout in later rounds, and I enjoy this very much.","Dec 4, 2019 at 1:10 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 17:19:02.595772,ash55,New features undermine fun of Ep. 1,"Gave it 3 stars because Episode II and III pales in comparison to the first Episode. The Lightsabre combat is Vader Immortal's greatest strength, however this fantastic system is wholly undermined by Episodes II and III, thanks to the introduction of comparatively overpowered, imprecise, and finicky Force Powers that feel unpleasant and unresponsive due to an ill-conceived delay when grabbing heavier enemies. The lightsabre becomes relegated exclusively to either a defensive tool for deflecting blaster bolts, or a projectile weapon that is nowhere near as precise or fun to use as a Blaster.

Episode III's dojo has some serious issues too. Using the Blaster is the fastest way to complete the tasks in the allotted time allowed due to their sheer power (which seems absurd for a Lightsabre game), but they don't respawn at the start of every round causing you the hassle of reloading the arena manually. To compound that, if you start a challenge by progressing from an earlier round, you are able to stockpile additional blasters from the previous round (and some of the tight time constraints it's almost as if this was intended.) Which feels like a strange oversight.

As for the final chapter in the campaign, it is really fun albeit brief. It has some of the issues outlined above - the Blaster and the Force becomes the superior option and overshadows the fun of Lightsabre combat. I would have thought the final showdown with Vader would be a longer battle that tested everything you had learned so far. But it doesn't last very long and ends with the VR equivalent of a story-driven QTE event which feels underwhelming.

I'm leaving a review because I hope the developers take some of the lessons learned, and continue to build on this resulting in a truly great VR Star Wars game with more specialisation (such as allowing the Jedi to remain Lightsabre focused by putting cooldowns on the Force Powers and perhaps separate ranged Blaster / Tech classes for Trooper, BH or Smuggler.)","Dec 1, 2019 at 6:29 PM",3, 5,

There really isn't much game here you just use your saber to block lasers coming at you, and you don't really have to do anything except hold your lightsaber up in front of you. Basically just stand there the whole game and you will win. Look around and everything falls apart. Unfinished textures, characters not reacting properly... There is one sequence on a skiff that goes on and on and on and its obvious they were just trying to add an extra 5 minutes to the play time.

2022-05-28 17:19:08.939804,SystemsNerd,Getting Worse,"So, the first episode was great, the second was so short it made Call of Duty seem epic, but it seemed like a bridging episode to something grand.  Episode III hits and it feels like a slow theme park ride.  You spend the entire episode moving to the next little spot on the floor where you take out a few stormtroopers, rinse, repeat.  The main draw was that force sparkies were going to be in it, but it is gated behind a kill count and only available in Dojo III, nowhere in the main game.  In no other SW game have I ever seen force lightning gated behind kill counts.  Ridiculous.  The story ends abruptly and requires almost no skill to beat.  

The Worst:   The droid's attitude was fresh in the beginning but has gone full teenager in this one.  You can't move a few steps without a complete immersion breaking petulant comment that shouldn't exist in this galaxy.  I tried many times to saber Z0-E3 to no effect.  

The Good:    The blaster was a nice add but only really useful for taking out droids in the dojo.  All-in-all, I'm going to wait for several more episodes before buying another.

2022-05-28 17:19:12.039513,SpiderMatty8,"The best one, but still underwhelming.","Vader Immortal seems like a huge waste of potential. Instead of focusing on 1, medium sized $20 game, they decided to split it into 3 40 minute ""episodes,"" leaving a fractured story that is only harmed further by the mediocre plotline.  
      Episodes 1, 2, and 3 were very underwhelming, they focused on a rather mediocre generic fantasy story, instead of the combat. After the first REAL lightsaber fight, you'll be thinking ""Who cares?"" anytime the story interrupts. Speaking of story, the story is bogged down by its characters, which range from ""The Most Annoying Droid Since The Nasally Droid from Season 5 of Clone Wars,"" to ""Darth Vader but actually Episode 2 Anakin."" 
      The main selling point of episode 3 was the final duel against Vader, which is hollow. Vaders moves are badly animated, and very distracting due to the rest of the games great animation. On top of this, it is IMPOSSIBLE to die. I let Vader hit me every time, and never died. This could've been the best fight of the game, but sadly it's bogged down.
     However, the bulk of the game is found in the Lightsaber Dojo, which gives you what you REALLY came for, the Lightsaber combat, and it's a bit underwhelming. The best part is deflecting blaster bolts, which feels incredibley satisified, but sadly the saber vs. saber combat is limited to fighting robots. On multiple occasions I would find my saber failing to block, and the enemies attack phasing through my lightsaber. Don't even bother trying with just the force or a blaster in later levels, as you'll frequently find yourself trying to dodge blaster bolts and lightsaber swings from all directions.
      Overall, I would say Vader Immortal as a series offers too little content for the $30 pricetag. If you're interested in lightsaber vs. lightsaber combat, I would recommend Blade and Sorcery with the Outer Rim mod. However if you want a frantic experience, I would get only Episode 3 of Vader Immortal. The story is not worth the extra $20.","Dec 2, 2019 at 11:23 AM",3, 0,

The Dojo Mk 3 is great! But it means that the previous 2 dojos are redundant. What I'm left with after 3 episodes, which combined are the  price of a full release, is a good-but-not-great 2hr (?) story that's a once-and-done experience, and 3 iterations of a Dojo mode where v3 is far and away the only one I'm going to play.

I personnaly do not enjoy the story mode. The droid is getting on my nerves and never stops talking. The Vader final fight is really stiff.

2022-05-28 17:19:18.460340,StormyDoesVR,Vader Simulator (Wait for the Bundle),"So, finally got the installation issues sorted, so... don't buy this.

I'm giving it five stars for a reason. As a huge Star Wars fan, I loved the experience. But it's an Experience, and should be priced as such. The entire series is 30$. It's barely worth half of that. Sure, the graphics are amazing, the lightsabers are cool, and the combat is ok. But the story (which enables the combat, lightsabers and graphics) is so terribly short, that I've beaten each Experience in under an hour! That totals about 3 hours total gameplay for the main storyline.

 And the dojo mode? Sure it might give you more to do, but it isn't a sandbox! You don't get all the lightsabers at the start, it isn't free locomotion, (at least the last two weren't, haven't actually played this one's dojo yet since the last two were so similar) so you're stuck in the middle of an incredibly detailed room, standing in one spot as a wave-shooter style of enemies come barreling down on top of you. You can't cover, you can't see all the lightsabers at the start (something this game sorely needs is a gallery you choose from) and the force powers, while yes, being fun when they work, are janky and only do what you want about 50%-40% percent of the time, at least for enemies.

For guns, they worked great, actually. I could force grab a pistol from a downed enemy like it was nothing. Loved that part. Kudos for adding the guns to the dojo, even if you do have to force grab them and can't holster them.

All in all, just wait for a bundle and maybe even a sale to get all 3 at around 15-20 dollars. You'll love the story, but you'll love it even more when you haven't wasted 30$ on a walking simulator, and a dodgy one at that. The main problem is this feels like something that was made to try and sell a larger experience, and there are even subtle hints at that. But it isn't worth paying 30$ to be hinted towards a bigger Star Wars game that may or may not be real at all.","Nov 26, 2019 at 6:10 AM",5, 0,

Sure there was some cool stuff (no spoilers), but it was over with a blink of an eye. 
Also being unable to move when things start to happen - taking away control from the player - isn't something I prefer. It made E3 seem even more dated than the other episodes to me - it felt more like a tech demo than a game. I think it took me 30 min to finish.
E3 is so dark you'll see the CV1 spud effect clearly, so seems like this one was designed for oled. The spud was kinda annoying, would have been great with slightly elevated light levels to remove spud - and probably make the game look even better on lcd hmds.

(SPOILERS!!)-> when Z0ey pushed off the admideral, and you looked down from where she pushed him, there was nobody.

I would even make a paper on this it was that great of an experience! If I had more time to type, I would. However I don't got that. 
In all, with each episode costing $10, it was worth it. Heck, if they even bounced it up more I would still continue it. I loved how in the first episode, it focused on the sabers.

Still even with that its frusterating but fun and I am glad I grabbed it. I just wish we could get more since all 3 episodes were so short.,"Nov 22, 2019 at 9:05 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:19:24.697657,tommosaur,"as game so so, as theme park movie great","If i'd rate this as a game, it would at best get a B- to C from me. Looked at as traditional game, it would be too short, too often block your free movement, just has no challenge at all in story mode (light saber dojo mode has challenge and is more like a traditional game mode).
But after playing the episodes some, it became clear to me that this is not intended to be a game in the traditional sense at all. This is intended to be a fan fantasy fullfillment theme park experience, and as that, it is pretty great, if not excellent.
Graphics and Audio are in a class of their own, very few VR and non VR games and movies come close to this production quality level.
The story and duration is short for usual game standards, but not too short at all when looked at as cinema movie or theme park film.
Basically it is one cinematic moment after the other, never longer than 3-5 minutes doing the same thing. Like as if they made a checklist of what type of Star Wars big cinematic moments could we all have in there, and then they added them all and put one after the other every few minutes. There is a story, with some a bit cheesy worn out moments, some great moments, but to me since i could not stray far from the path nor have branching story choices and the scenery and tasks change constantly, it felt more like the story is there to have a reason to move you from one great Star Wars set piece to another than a world and story one explores freely.
So yeah, if you're looking for a game with constant free movement, challenge etc (in the main story mode, too, not ""just"" in lightsaber dojo), then you may be disappointed. If you  want a great Star Wars theme park experience, this is hands down the best thing one can have in that field at home right now and really pretty amazing if one thinks about being able to have a theme park experience on this very high visuals, audio and immersion level at home now.

2022-05-28 17:19:24.748521,Bandleader,The weakest of them all :/,"First I have to say that the developers did a great job, adding new features and abilities in gameplay with each new episode.  So in this case they managed to build up a good dramturgy, but in matters of the gameplay experience of every episode and developement of the story that should come along with it, not so much... Even though this episode has great cinematical moments, they did not have the same impact like standing befor Vader for the first time, wielding the lightsaber while using the force, or fighting a Rancor! While the immersion and the feeling of beeing part of the Star Wars universe, grew from Episode I to Episode II, some how that great feeling got lost entirely in episode III. The long awaited show down with Vader took place way to early and did not feel half as spectacular as the boss fight in Episode II. And after beeing able to sabre throw in the previous episode, it felt wrong not beeing able to do so in this one. I think the lack of interaction, story and charakter development  makes this episode the weakest of the trilogy. And that is very sad as I was looking forward to this episode hoping this would end in an ultimate climax of Star Wars awesomeness. This one nearly felt like a cash grab, compared to the scope of the previous episodes. But as the selling price for all three episodes is still not compareable to a ""full length"" game ( whatever that length might be in VR ) I only deduct one star, as I would like to compare it to watching an interactive movie. So in retrospect to the whole experience it was definitly worth my while and I am looking forward to go back out there, and search for that treasure ZOE3 was talking about ;)

I think there were more ""Ooh stand on the blue spot!"" Cutscene moments than ever before. To me that kind of handholding is akin to a magician telling the audience to turn around for a second before she does a trick. If it had been well designed, where the player stands should be natural or unimportant. This was such an jarring interruption it took me out of the story every time.

Sadly the story is a bit short, I guess it was under an hour of playtime for me. Now going to the Lightsaber Dojo of course.
I also hoped for more force abilities! I would have loved to use force lightning, extreme jumps and so on. (Optional?) walking with the thumbsticks would have been great as well.

It's short, obviously, they all are, but this one felt like I actually did even less than the first two. The drawn out vehicle ride deflecting blaster shots started off fun, but when they just kept coming it was very immersion breaking for me, it became a dumb arcade game.
The walkway bit was cool with regard to the environment and using the force to throw troopers and grab blasters and grenades. Shooting the blasters was a good addition too, but being planted to the spot again felt immersion breaking.
The confrontation with Vader, wtf, seriously? This should have been EPIC. The fight, if you can even call it that, was over so fast and was easier than any dojo droid.
That's my main criticism of this episode, there was no big awesome finish.
At the end of the day, reviews here are a little pointless as anyone who played the first two will buy this, and rightly so. Of course you need to finish the ""saga"", just don't expect much.","Nov 22, 2019 at 9:38 AM",2, 14,

From the 20-30 minutes it runs towards the credits, you do some simple lightsaber vs laser fights - which are quite boring because they seem like they are here to stretch the ""game"" to it´s already short 30 mins. There are some nice ideas in this episode, but none of them are well executed or thought to the end. For example the fight against the Tie Fighter could have more phases and not just the same old lightsaber vs laser fight mechanic. We could have been in the middle of the assault of the palace witnessing the confusion and terror of endless laser fire from the huge fight. Maybe we could have captures a walker ourselfes and so make it into the palace. Nope just some hallways with some troopers with the same mechanic. Don´t get me wrong i enjoyed all three series when looking at them combined, but all three should have been one episode, especially for the price tag - compare it to asgard´s wrath and then think about it. I hope the developers will come up with more stuff, but especially consider gameplay in vr as equally important then just serving the franchise - Episode I set the right tone for me, but what followed didn´t impress me that much.","Nov 24, 2019 at 9:53 PM",2, 7,

I was left thinking... ""that's it""? The entirety of the fight scene lasts what feels like less than minute, which is the whole moment the series was building towards. I was hoping to have a longer or at least somewhat difficult fight against Vader, but instead it was one or two rounds of a faster-paced version of the lightsaber gameplay from the previous episodes. In fact, that's the ONLY time you engage in a lightsaber fight. 

The story simply felt rushed towards the end, to the point that I had very little time to even process what was going on before it ended. Otherwise, the game has wonderful visuals and sound design and it certainly has its moments.

The 1st and 2nd Episodes were better inspired and for some reason the plot seemed more interesting.

This doesn't mean is bad! It is not if you play E1 and E2 and then jump straight into E3. (Like a regular game).  I had much fun the 2nd time around with E3 when I played E1 and E2 in a row. When I played E3 on launch day after quite some time since I played E2, it didn't feel that great.

Which leads me to my next topic: All these 3 episodes should have been released a SINGLE game. Hopefully in the future there will be a way to play all 3 as a single experience instead of having to constantly jump from one app to another.
