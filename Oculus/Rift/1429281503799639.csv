Hitting a note on a drum  should give more feedback. Xylophone and the other ""thing"" are okay, vibration wise but when you hit a drum, you expect ... more. Overall, this is an okay game. I would probably go back from time to time should the height be adjustable and there was more feedback on the drums.","Mar 11, 2019 at 3:18 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 18:09:42.665193,taquitobuddy,Could have been better,"This rhythm game has a good number, variety, and selection of songs, including a few really great ones.  However, it got released and then abandoned with a few serious bugs and mistimings still in the game.  There are a number of other issues as well, and the bottom line is with games like Beat Saber and Audica, there is no reason anyone would want to buy this.  Giving it a bonus star because I liked the music and unlike games such as Soundboxing/Audioshield, the timing actually matters.","Apr 26, 2019 at 1:00 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:09:42.680152,Meedok,PLAIN TERRIBLE!,"Was very hopefull when I purchased this game, then I just couldn't bear playing it more than 4 minutes! Here we go:
1- If I am going to be drumming and hitting stuff while keeping my focus on the upcoming signals, then at least give me controller feedback! It doesn't feel like drumming at all.
2- How is anyone rating this as fun for dancing and having fun? This is a pure score-focus game like all the phone app games where you just need to foncus and use your figers at the right moment. BOX VR involves way more dancing and fun than this, although it is only meant a workout game.
3- The light things that you have to match and response texts are very annoying in VR. They cause headaches","Sep 10, 2018 at 6:45 AM",1, 17,
2022-05-28 18:09:42.695112,Nai_Usagi,"Fun, but needs just a little more.","Fun Game, fast paced, music is pretty sweet for the most part.
I dropped a star because it needs more song options and because the scoring is boring. Unlocked all of the songs the first day. :(
Add a song new music, add some better scoring, maybe multiple locations and they may have something awesome here.","Dec 13, 2017 at 9:12 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:09:42.709075,Shizzmoo,Tired of Japanese Pop/Techno?,"This game is really great. I honestly did not think I would like it though, as I was not a big fan of DDR or Guitar Hero style games. This game definitely has a great selection of music genres though, and most of the instruments are really fun to play with the right track. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the color matching bubbles that you have to pop in order - it never actually felt like it fit in with the rest of the rythym matching instruments. Please add more songs to each genre, and maybe get rid of the in-a-row bubbles (it really doesn't fit). I really feel like this game can be so much more!","Aug 29, 2017 at 12:17 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:09:45.875605,Micro666,A must buy game!! Loved it!,"So I've had a Rift for a while now, and some games just blow you away, and are so entertaining. This is one of those games. Some games are must have games. This is one of those games.

It's really fun to play, great music, catchy, and it's pretty energetic.

This is a game I will be playing for some time yet. If you want an interactive VR experience, that isn't an FPS, then this is a must buy!","Aug 9, 2017 at 2:03 AM",5, 2,
