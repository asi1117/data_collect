The bat swing by clicking the mouse button is delayed and every other hit is a home run which fills up a meter that wins the game. The Trivia Quiz mode of the game asks questions that make no sense like name a date that ""I"" hit my first home run or name a ball park without showing any picture of a ball park, these things make no sense. Needs some work.","Jul 2, 2017 at 11:35 AM",2, 5,
