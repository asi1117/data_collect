2022-05-28 15:46:06.908200,bizkit1961,a delight to eyes and ears,"Don't think I have ever watched anything with David Attenborough that isn't wonderful to watch.  Being in VR with him made it better. The VR effects in this was great and it's something I will show family who claim VR is a gimmick. loved it, although I wished it was longer, but I feel I got more then my monies worth",Aug 7 at 6:11 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:46:06.923159,ReubenHopscotch,A masterpiece of VR education,"VR education has had me massively excited since I was a kid. The future generations will have access to so many advanced tools that they will blow us away! This is wonderful step towards that. Not only does it execute what VR education should be like it nails what an ""experience"" should be, in my opinion. There are parts that feel a little clunky to interact with but there is a nice balance of the interactiveness and the non interactive bits. It is something you can recommend to anyone and I strongly recommend this to you!",Jul 27 at 12:31 PM,5, 1,

Like others, I am not too obsessed by fossils but to be guided by Sir David from behind the scenes at London’s Natural History Museum made me want to listen and learn.

2022-05-28 15:46:10.098665,GreatOrmesby,Hold the world is superb on the Oculus,"When I saw the price of this app I did not expect much at all BUT I was enthralled for the whole time it was on.  I had a little difficulty opening the drawers t first as the arms of my armchair were in the way but some slight guardian adjustments soon solved that issue.
The amazing thing is I want to go back again and again.
I hope at some point more is added (even at a price, I for would be more than willing to pay) 
Please developers take note and provide more of this type of content it's one of the best apps (if not the best) I have used.","Oct 2, 2020 at 10:57 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:46:10.113625,inceptional,Great plus educational. Limited content.,"What's there is great but I'd like to see more content added. Some of the skeletal versions of creatures could do with sections where we seem them with flesh too, and more of them movement and stuff too. And we just need more of them to see aswell, like a T-Rex (because everyone loves T-Rex), and whatever else. Also, let us use hand pointers to select stuff, and maybe use the right analog stick on Touch to snap rotate the camera so we can view the rest of the rooms easily just for fun.","Jun 18, 2020 at 8:35 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 15:46:16.453668,Angelina Starr,SImply Amazing,We need to see more VR content like this.  And it would be awesome if SKY and Attenborough could expand on the specimens from the museum too.   I would pay for the update with that.  This was pretty incredible.,"Mar 1, 2019 at 1:38 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:46:16.469625,QuovadisTom,Rough beginning but amazing experience,"Let me start off with the bad: After purchasing, David Attenborough was nowhere to be found and my hands would not interact with the drawers, although the sound was there. After getting in touch with the developers, it turned out to be a problem with Windows 7. You NEED Windows 10 for this experience, otherwise it WILL NOT work!
Now, for the experience itself. Without spoiling everything: there are three rooms you can go through. Each room has 2 creatures. Each creature is incredibly detailed. General information and specific information will be told in an interactive manner, and at the end the creatures will come to life! This happens for all 6 creatures. However, there are some surprises, which I won’t spoil.
Graphics wise this experience is amazing. It has realistic graphics and textures, and David Attenborough looks very real. The controls can be a bit annoying, as it makes use of your head movement. This can be a bit awkward, and the dot that’s sometimes used can be a bit unclear. The touch controllers work fine, and I was intrigued by the hands that seem to form dynamically around the specimen you’re holding. The sound is also excellent, especially the music. It fits the story and movements very well and makes it even more immersive.
Besides the use of the headset as controls, there is one more slightly negative point. Due to the resolution of the rift, small, flying creatures are difficult to see, especially when far away. However, this really is a minor annoyance, nothing more.
In conclusion: I’ve had a really good time with this app. It’s a wonderful educational tool, and it engages you in an impressive way. The excellent graphics and sound make it one of the most appealing experiences out there, despite the sometimes annoying control scheme and the occasional blurriness due to the resolution of the rift. It’s well worth the price, but make sure you have Windows 10!","Nov 25, 2018 at 8:20 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 15:46:16.484585,nrosko,VR education as good as it gets.,"If you have the slightest interest natural history or have enjoyed sir David Attenborough previous work this is  essential viewing. For the price of a pint its well worth the money. 
Technically this really shows what is possible with photogrametry & hi res scanning in VR.  The is truly a well crafted peice of VR entertainment & the team behind this clearly have high standards. I'm watchng with 1.6 pixel density & everything is so sharp & real looking. The audio & the animations are also done with a great deal of care & talent. 
I found the subject matter really interesting & enhanced by virtual realities unique ability to interact with objects & enhance their size. We have Sir Attenborough sitting oposite spreading his wisdom & knowledge, this is truly a unique experience.","Nov 4, 2018 at 5:43 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:46:19.602247,itschriscollins,"Stunning quality, worth every penny","This is by no means a particularly long experience, nor is it likely to have you coming back every day or even every month. But it's of an incredible level of detail and quality, and features the standard charm of David Attenborough that no one can resist.

You get to sit in three rooms in the Natural History Museum, normally never seen by the general public, recrated from scans taken in those rooms, and the quality here is pretty good to start with. In each room you will be able to look at two items, perhaps a fossil or insect, and Attenborough will talk you through them - and here's where it gets really good: David Attenborough was recorded in 360 degrees with 160 cameras to place his recording inside virtual reality and it is uncanny. You really feel like you are sat opposite this incredible man. Now, a day later, I still feel like I've actually met the man and spoken fact to face.

While he's talking you through these items you are able to pick them up, resize them, and look at them in incredible detail, as Attenborough highlights small marks on the bone or writing left by the original finder. Then these items will come to life - a stegosaurus will run alongside you, a trilobite will crawl around the desk, a lifesize blue whale will swim around you.

It's incredibly impressive, and absolutely fascinating.","Nov 3, 2018 at 8:49 PM",5, 25,
2022-05-28 15:46:19.617207,BestFromAbove,Good but developers need to do some work,The experience was great however the developers should have really known better than to lock selection to head movement. Whoever approved that idea obviously does not know about comfort in VR (especially when having to move your head in a awkward way to select a talking point on an artifact). This app will not age well on the rift with this hinderance. Allow an option to select items/rooms with the touch controller rather than your head.,"Nov 5, 2018 at 12:46 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:46:19.671063,Plurr,Properly designed VR app,"Essentially photorealistic, with an actual person acting as your guide through the content. This is a bit of a milestone for educational VR. This is how it's done.","Nov 4, 2018 at 6:02 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:46:22.777754,RuneSR2,Makes you believe in (educational) VR,"This is a masterpiece of (educational) VR. I won't go into detail about the content as this is described perfectly in other reviews (see Itschriscollins review). To experience the amazing beauty of the specimens to the fullest, you need to activate high levels of super sampling. Using a heavily oc'ed GTX 1080, i7 7700K and 16GB 3200 MHz I had no trouble using super sampling 2.0 by using the Oculus Tray Tool. There are no video settings in this app, but this way you'll get incredibly detailed textures and antialiasing. Only in presence of Attenborough I did notice 45 fps ASW, but it was no problem - and Attenborough isn't animated in 90 fps, probably more like 24-30 fps, still it works flawlessly. 
Animations on the specimens when swimming or walking are extraordinarily wellmade, they look real. And high-res textures look real. I only wish that I could have rotated the specimens using for example the left thumb stick on the Touch controller - and maybe to resize using the right thumb stick. Could also be nice with full locomotion to walk around in the museum, but yes - that's a dream for future versions or other similar projects. Congrats to the developers and especially Sir David Attenborough for this exceptional and fantastic achievement.","Nov 4, 2018 at 6:29 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 15:46:22.808671,demotricus,Superb.,"An absolute delight. There is approximately an hours worth of content to educate and enthrall you in this presentation. The clarity of the VR is quite breathtaking and Sir David Attenborough masterfully presents the specimens pointing out various points of interest in each piece. There is plenty to see within the VR surroundings as well, I found it fascinating to see the areas in the Natural History Museum normally closed off to the public,  i.e. the places where specimens are prepared and worked on before they are placed on display.
The only niggle I saw with this was a small one, - if opening a draw to look at a new specimen, just placing your VR `hand` over the top of the draw, closes it. You have to approach it from a shallow angle or the draw closes on you.
Overall though, quite superb, and well worth the price.","Nov 10, 2018 at 3:11 PM",5, 1,
