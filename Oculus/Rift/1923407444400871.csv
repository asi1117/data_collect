2022-05-28 19:38:14.661168,tonyfromsyracuse,Love these type of demo's,"I prefer simple room/apartment/house VR demos even more than games, because for me....the ability to change my immediate enviroment showcases the power and future of VR more so than a game IMO. for instance, my bed in my room is positioned like the bed in the ferris room. so I laid down,put my head on my pillow, and for all intent and purpose was actually inside the ferris room. it effectively transported me via this simple VR demo.  the only downers are the lack of a window with a street scene and sun shining into the room to give it more depth and the crudeness of the graphics,such as the windows which appear to be just flat. but thats just nitpicking. love the information about the room.","Aug 26, 2018 at 10:15 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 19:38:14.676128,UBSERD,Bueller....Bueller...Bueller..,If you are a fan of the movie from the 80's it's a cool recreation of the iconic room with all of the signature boobie traps thats worth the download. Very cool and free! If you've never seen the movie it may not be for you.,"Aug 5, 2018 at 10:19 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 19:38:14.690091,FastLawyer,It's just a VR environment,It is a detailed VR environment of Ferris Bueller's bedroom. And there's a few things you can point and click it to get some audio clips from. There's 3 teleport locations. That's the whole experience. You can't grab or pick up anything.,"Aug 7, 2018 at 2:54 PM",3, 6,
