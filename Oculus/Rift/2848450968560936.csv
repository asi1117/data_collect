This game has a really interesting concept and you feel a slight adrenaline rush while playing it, but there isn't really much content or variety, it's always the same: cross the streets as far as you can, without getting hit.
It would be cool if the cars wouldn't be all white/pastell colors, and if there would be more decorations (think Crossy Road, a similar game on phones, where birds, squirrels, street lamps, hydrants and post boxes were around you while crossing streets).
What would be also cool if there would be a night mode, where it's dark and you can only see cars because of their headlights, or you have to cross forest streets, where also animals pass.
It could be also more challenging if there would be road works on some streets, so you can only pass the streets in certain locations.

All in all it's a really good game per se, yet it seems bland and repetitive after some tries. I really hope the developers will read my ideas, because I think this game does have much much potential and I would recommend it buying it even now.","Sep 30, 2019 at 5:01 AM",4, 4,
