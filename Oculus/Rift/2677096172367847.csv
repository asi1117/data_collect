The audio part is good, with music and sound atmosphere, wind sound, which combined very well. I think it's a great idea to fly over places following a pre-defined path, without me having to worry about manual controls, so the relaxation is greater. Positive point too. So I also don't see any need to have the option to spin hidden objects, it doesn't add anything to the experience. The graphics are extremely primitive and repetitive, as if they were done in a single day. I think it could vary more over time to make it more interesting. The timer in front of the screen, damages the visual. But in general, I found the experience pleasant and the app is welcome. I rate it at 3/5, but with future updates I can increase it.",Mar 3 at 11:54 PM,3, 0,
