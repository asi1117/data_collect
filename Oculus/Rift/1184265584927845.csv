2022-05-28 14:06:36.232347,JaMMyJJam,Would be a 5 but no saved games,"I first bought this game when it was on sale for 1/2 price. I had the issue where even though I purchased the game, it would say it was the demo. I returned the game not knowing when or if this would be fixed. The developer said they fixed the issue so I bought it again at full price. Now I have the problem that the developer hasn't addressed; no saved games. After each level you should see an icon next to the level showing that it is complete. These show up, until I restart the game then all progress is lost. The odd thing is that all of the levels are unlocked.That wasn't true for the non-vr steam version. You had to unlock as you progressed. This game would easily be a 5 for me but the developer is not addressing the saved games issue. I played both DG 1 and DG 2 on Steam and loved both games. I was so hyped to see this here on the Oculus store on VR and I love the experience, but NO SAVED GAMES!! That mean no progress or weapon unlocks every time I restart the game. What gives? They developer need to address this issue. I bet a lot of people don't even realize they have this issue since they can get to every level. This is just dumb. Fix it already. It obviously this likely has to do with the location of the Documents folder in Windows and it probably fairly simple to fix. So frustrating.

History:I really love this game! but disappointed by the full game purchase as it is still showing as a demo! I am so surprised that despite so many bad reviews here, the developer did not address this bug in the app sale. Truely disappointing! I really hope this gets addressed soon.

Hope there is a solution as I do not want to refund it.

Update - 16 January 2020

Oculus have been great, but...

The issue has now been repaired and has resulted in a ""Game Files Corrupt"" issue so it is now completely unplayable...

Update - 23 January 2020

Communication is now sparse.  No further replies for the developer and the same questions over and over again from different support people at oculus.

Reduced my initial rating from 5 stars down to 1.  Not a game rating, but this should not be so hard to fix...

Update 25 January 2020

Installed Oculus software and Defense Grid on a second machine.  Fresh installation of Windows 10 updated to Build 1909.  Different make and model of MB, CPU, RAM, SSD and GPU.  Oculs Rift S and Oculus Quest with Link.  Same error in that I get demo with full purchase.

Oculus says developer and developer says Oculus.  Tennis anyone?

Tons of challenge missions and good difficulty options to test your skill against, too.

Unlocking tower upgrades feels hit or miss, and the game doesn't make the best use of VR - I would have liked to see more direct interaction with the towers, such as picking them up and placing them.

Also, I have noticed this game tends to lock up on the headset every so often, voiding any progress in a mission, which is frustrating - so far, I've been unable to remedy the issue.

The first three missions (chapter 1) provide about an hours' worth of experience (hard level) and I found them very enjoyable. And let's not forget the cheeky voice-overs which are spot on and add to the experience (mother-in-law visit?).

Personally, I wasn't aware that the remaining chapters require IAPs (In App Purchases) to activate, which detracts somewhat from the whole experience.

2022-05-28 14:07:11.052138,facechriscat,Disappointing strategy but good gameplay,"The game is pretty great, but I find the pacing fairly off in general. The pacing makes you feel like you're winging everything (which you are). The game doesn't actually allow you to observe the boardspace before the enemies approach, making any initial strategy impossible. You'll end up doing a lot of base reformatting. Since the waves come quickly, you'll only be able to make minor changes.

The other part is how they introduce new enemies. Basically every enemy has to be dealt with through trial and error. Even their own listed ""counters"" aren't the most efficient. Not only that, but new enemies seem to be introduced every map, and new map elements are introduced every map. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed in the early stages.

Those are the main drawbacks I'm finding. The game feels so on the fly since it's impossible to just pause and actually think about what you're doing. It's kinda balanced for that, but some of the juicy placements are basically going to just be luck. There's zero chance of getting a pefect build the first time you play any map without preplanning with online spoilers.","Jan 27, 2018 at 1:46 PM",4, 0,

The major defect is at times your AI stops shooting at the enemy that's about to escape and goes for the one that is closer. Also your units tend to go back and forth between targets instead of focusing on one.  It would be nice if you could make both logic decisions.  It would also be great if you could inhabit whatever turret you wanted and control the weaponry!  Despite that I loved it!  I can't wait until DG3!,"Jan 17, 2018 at 3:08 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 14:07:14.190357,Dregen5,I am addicted,"This game grows on you. It's not like Robo Recall or Lone Echo where you are blown away by the cool VR effects and graphics, but the more you play this game in VR the more you appreciate how awesome it is to play strategy games this way. I tried this on both the xbox and oculus, and the VR version is so much better. It's not just a simple port - this is THE way to play the game. 

You can see the entire board at once and instantly point and place towers where they need to be. It really feels like a real-life interactive game board that you get to play around with. Once I've built up all my towers it feels nice to just walk around the board and inspect the carnage. Also the replay value is incredible, I've replayed several missions already to try to get higher scores/try out different strategies. You can also play it your way - there's also a ton of options and difficulty combinations you can select to modify mission parameters and increase the replay value even further. I've checked out another game they've made Witchblade and it looks fun as well - I personally love hard/challenging games which these devs do a good job of.

I was very skeptical about the idea of this game making it to VR, and boy was I wrong. It's actually more fun this way, and with the touch controller, much more comfortable and natural to play this way. The game in itself is a tower defense type of game, and can be enjoyed at any level of difficulty, for casual or hardcore gamers. Different gameplay modes make it nice to come back to any map, try new strategies or improve your preferred one.

The only real downside is the campaign story. Bad story, bad voice acting. Three AI's bickering most of the time, made the game unpleasant. I think it can be turned off in the options.

It would have got another star if the price was on the store as well.

Also missing a few game modes compared to steams version.
first chapter on steam version has 10 differnt modes to do,where vr version only has 7?
These will add up through all the chapters.
So we will end up losing tons of game modes.

2022-05-28 14:07:45.886472,ZebedeeBoing,Good free TD experience,"The free trial version is a pretty good typical tower defense game. VR is utilised a little bit by needing to search the battlefield for some things. 

Some niceish story going on with quality voice acting for this type of game. A great idea to have a free trial version and it ALMOST had me buying the full retail version but the price stopped me short of pressing the button. I think it was £10.99 for the full retail version and it is certainly worth that much, I have paid a lot more for a lot less but there is just so much competition for this game to go up against at the moment and I would rather put my pennies elsewhere. 

If it were cheaper I would have definitely bought it but then they would be underselling the game a little. 

Could be improved with some upgraded controls of the towers (fire at first/last/strongest), most utilisation of the 1st person perspective by controlling towers personally and maybe actively introducing trial players to some of the other tower types.","Aug 11, 2017 at 10:30 PM",4, 1,

DG2 enhanced VR edition was a project that required a lot of additional work to bring the game into VR (it has extra game features, levels, and isn't simply a port). This was funded by Oculus, thus it being on the Oculus store. The title does have Revive support though, and if OSVR has some sort of Revive-like counterpart, it should work too. Hope this helps you understand why the VR title isn't on Steam."

Some negatives though I get a lot of artifcats coming in this game (looks like polygons spray out of objects on the edge of vision) playable but highly distracting at the same time.  It has also crashed on me twice. Also on larger maps there seems to be a bit of distence clipping. I preffered to get an over view of the map but the texture patterns being quite geometric and the goggle resolution means you get a lot of nosie at that scale unfortunatley - a lower grid / gun point of view is much cleaner.","Apr 23, 2017 at 11:47 PM",3, 2,
