2022-05-28 15:23:18.783904,DelapierceD,"Extensive Tour, Lot of Info","Not good as an introduction - way too much info without a narrative. But if you are familiar with Chernobyl, and want to see the real places with supplmental material about the experiences you already have some grasp on, you will likely enjoy","Mar 10, 2021 at 2:28 PM",5, 32,
2022-05-28 15:23:18.797867,janc58,Real Reality,Excellent portrayal of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and its consequences. A lesson of history very well told.,"Sep 10, 2020 at 4:41 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 15:23:18.821803,stealthkk,Terribly disappointed.,"I am obsessed with Chernobyl so I was super excited to get this game. It doesn't work. Plain and simple. Did they not play their own game? The settings does nothing, then I start the game and it has a spindle of different places to ""visit"" (I assume) but you just aim at them and the guy says what it is, and then...nothing. That's it, that's the game. You can't do anything else. Literally. I'm serious. Total waste of money.","Jan 12, 2020 at 6:38 AM",1, 75,
2022-05-28 15:23:18.838758,MyWy,"A pricey tech demo, not without merit","A fair experience. I really only bought this title to give the developer encouragement with their current project, Chernobylite.
There are a lot of different styles of education here, from full 3D rooms you can explore, 3D video clips, 2D clips applied in interesting ways (like on a TV set or projected onto a screen), and audio clips. The information leans towards the memories of the residents and away from the actual facts of the meltdown. In the NPP control room, I think I might have missed something as a voice prompt told me to find the clues to learn more about the disaster, but I couldn't find a thing.
The rooms rendered fully in VR are, of course, the real payoff here. Although they suffer from lots of technical glitches, that didn't take away from the experience.","Sep 9, 2019 at 5:46 AM",3, 17,
2022-05-28 15:23:18.866683,MrGeddings,not bad but could be much better,"i think they just gave up on updating it which is a real shame.   and the latest update (over a few years ago) that removed the walking feature. it would have been nice to have that option.........the main issue too is that there is no vr scenes of outside the powerplant or other areas in the plant (maybe they wernt allowed?) 

the video flyby segments are often low res 

and there should really be a few more 3d full scenes 

i say worth a try for those interesed in cherynobl and pripyat but it just falls short a bit on what it could have been and makes you long for a bigger more detailed vr chernybl experence.

perhaps that will come someday.","Jun 23, 2019 at 8:30 AM",3, 23,
2022-05-28 15:23:21.996312,ksn,It's awfull,"Total dissapoint. It's some kind of excursion. You have few created places you can walk through (too bad details quality), few low quality and wrong scaled 360 degrees videos and bunch of bugs with that simple product.
I love Chernobyl things, but this product worth no attention. Total waste of money, i really regret i wait it and bought it.
I didn't give 1 star just because this product represent just something. This is free demo level for sure, not for money.","Mar 22, 2019 at 5:06 AM",2, 17,
2022-05-28 15:23:22.011272,baggyg,Eerie Atmosphere,"Overall this was an expereience I was glad I had. Things like the Moscow Eye I had been completely ignorant of. The experience itself is a bit uneven. The photoscans with overlaid 3d modelling are the crown jewel of experiences here and are excellent. This technique must surely be the future of digital tourism. 3D pictures are fine. The 3d videos are the weak spot both in terms of quality and immersion. 

Generally I would say to keep people engaged there must be an ongoing narration whilst they are also actively travelling or looking around. 

The narration is good, although some of the conversations that are translated become dry and a bit boring because of the speed and tone they are conveyed in. 

Overall good effort by the devs. A step in the right direction for digital tourism but lot of progress still needing to be made in the industry as a whole.","Feb 22, 2018 at 4:10 AM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 15:23:22.026233,WickedSinLover,Nothing to see here,"Seems like it would be a fun video but I can only hear audio, cant see anything after the loading screen.","Mar 25, 2018 at 8:06 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 15:23:22.041192,RisingToo,I Liked It,"I found it to be an awesome experience. It took me into something I would never have gotten to see in real life. It showed me things like how Russians live and gave me insight into the types of ways they do live. Virtual reality stuff is still new and developers are trying to learn to work with it and the only problem I had was that some stuff looked too big according to my size and that I didnt like really being off the grouind in some parts of the experience. I was off the ground when I shouldnt have been. But all in all, I bought it for 5 bucks and it was definitely worth it.","Sep 4, 2017 at 10:35 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 15:23:22.056152,tk4cz3u3u,"Don't buy it, it's waste of money.","I think, that few photos and googleearth-like view shouldn't be for money.
this is not worth more, than 1$.","Oct 8, 2017 at 9:23 PM",1, 12,"The application includes 3d scanned locations: hospital, school no. 3, flat, control room, top of the moscow eye, as well as stereographic 360 panoramas and 360 stereoscopic videos. For every location we picked the most appropriate methods of content presentation. Did you visit all the locations?"

2022-05-28 15:23:25.172817,andrewenz,,"When I purchased this, it worked fine in Windows 8. They updated it and now it won't run unless you've got Windows 10. When it worked, it was OK. Some interesting stuff, but slow and may cause motion sickness. Not worth downgrading my OS for.","Mar 31, 2017 at 4:09 PM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 15:23:25.201739,UmbraMonstrum,,"I felt ripped off on the price. Honestly would've enjoyed the educational side of it, but knowing I paid $10 to hear a russian dude talk over 360 .jpg's annoyed me.","Dec 25, 2016 at 11:55 PM",1, 15,
2022-05-28 15:23:25.216699,Arranox,No point in getting early access,"I kinda regrett getting this early access, but its not bad. The enviroments that are completly finsihed are really high quality and give you a good sense og presence. but most are 360 camera photos or videos that are so low quality they make you nauseated and if not they dont really give you any sense of presence either. the development looks really promising, so definitely put this on your wishlist for when the completed experience gets released :)","Jan 6, 2017 at 11:22 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:23:28.297459,cybernettr,,"I told myself I would view only one or two of the scenes on first run of this app, but I found myself being drawn into every single one of them on the first evening. It's amazing how badly buildings and an entire area can decay in just 30 years if neglected (makes me wonder how the Parthenon lasted so long). App contains a nice mix of real life (photographic but not stereoscopically 3D) scenes and  computer-generated, fully 3D, explorable models and interiors. As with most VR apps, the photographic scenes, due to file size, are not HD and therefore not as sharp as the computer-generated interiors. In some scenes the dialog is so loud I can hardly hear the translator--1 star off for that. Fans of urban ruin exploration will enjoy this app. I wouldn't want to risk radiation poisoning by going anywhere near Chernobyl IRL, so kudos to the developer for doing the risky stuff for us!","Dec 25, 2016 at 5:11 AM",3, 11,
