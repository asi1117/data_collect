2022-05-28 19:34:00.620923,nightcat.mau,Human Kills Poly Giant,"This is beautiful but I’m not seeing any lesson about respect here. So far as I can figure out, a lovely giant poly creature wants to go to the beach and fiddle about in a sea cave. They don’t even seem aware of the human as they happily smile and do whatever it is they are doing. The human sees a pictograph of the creature, decides the evil attacking beast must die (even though the giant seems blissfully unaware of the human) and pulls its gem heart out. The poor beastie dies and the human is killed by the gem heart and becomes a cave doodle. Seriously, that is what I got out of it. So the lesson is kill anything different than you, I guess.","Jul 9, 2018 at 2:38 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:34:00.635883,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Neat experience,Good quality experience with nice art direction and production value. It's short but free so--- good for demoing.,"Apr 15, 2018 at 9:21 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:34:00.666800,Arqan0,Not enough focus on the story,"This strikes me as one of the more lazy attempts at creating a short VR film. While the massive golem (and the crab) is kind of impressive, everything else is not up to par. The story is not conveyed all that well and it's all just all too 'artsy' for its own good.","Dec 1, 2017 at 6:31 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:00.682757,FastLawyer,"Nice art style, short story","There really are nice visuals in this VR experience if you like this particular art style.  The whole world is blue and cold.  The shapes are geometrical.   The story is very short.  And it does leave interpretation to the audience.  It's just a little too short and too perplexing.   Not something to show off to family, friends, or kids unless they enjoy artsy shows.","Oct 7, 2017 at 12:00 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:03.806524,Bob-Rolha,An excellent polygonal adventure.,"An excellent polygonal adventure.
It reminds a lot of the atmosphere of the game ""Out of this world"" success of the 90's. (The whole game fit inside a floppy of 1.44mb)
Everything looks great in this world, very good sonority and polygonal graphics are pleasing. It's worth the experience. The only problem, as is common in all rift applications, is the amount of gigabytes of storage, in the case of this one, neither textures have, polygons based programs nor should they take up much storage space, even with audio use and some images, yet So it does not justify so many gigabytes. The next game engines, at least should bother to solve this problem, but I think it is more responsability of the programmer. Currently, this is a constant in RV. Believe it or not, using mathematical codes, you could do this application with less than 1 mega without effort. If you think this is absurd, know that there are communities of programmers who compete with each other, programming for PC, true animations at the limit of 4Kbytes.","Jun 4, 2017 at 2:54 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:03.820487,neuro27,Short with Impressive Scale,"I've noticed that many of the first VR experiences like to impress with giant characters to show off. The unique artstyle makes up for low-poly graphics. Beyond that, it's an interesting little story that's worth checking out.","Jun 20, 2017 at 10:18 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:03.835447,Grift23,Decent but,"The story is very lacking, and the graphics are somewhat subpar, but the experience was free. 3 stars would have been a stretch IMO.","Jan 21, 2017 at 7:48 AM",2, 4,
