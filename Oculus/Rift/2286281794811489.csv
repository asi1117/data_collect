2022-05-28 20:57:28.114736,ThatPeskyBoat,Simply Brilliant.,"To start out: I love this game. It's fantastic in so many ways, and scratches a lot of itches that I have. Brilliant mechanics, great gameplay. If you enjoy crafting games and/or games like Beatsaber or Fruit Ninja, then you're in luck. This game gives you such a hands-on approach to the entire crafting of the blade. It's good. It also LOOKS good, and somehow looks more finished than a lot of games that I've played despite not being finished at all. You can also view their roadmap for future updates on their website, so there's a lot to be excited for.

Loving it doesn't stop me from viewing it critically, though.

Of course, seeing as it's early access, it's very much expected to have bugs and the such.
- Sometimes you can get stuck, especially when using smooth locomotion. 
- No subtitles. This was a huge problem for me since I have difficulties with hearing things that are being said to me, and I was in a loud environment at the time of the tutorial, and the tutorial NPC isn't particularly loud itself, so I ended up having to figure A LOT of things out for myself. It's not necessarily difficult to do this, since a lot of it is quite intuitive, but it's still irritating.
- There's no explanation as to what a lot of things do in-game. For example, the potions that are labelled... vaguely. The stamps are also labelled vaguely with pictures, which is bad because they're for stats which can have a HUGE effect on your ability to survive in the timechamber. The mining apparatus parts don't give any indication as to what they might affect. They also start at level one apparently so having it in the upgrade book is a little odd.",Jan 24 at 7:21 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:57:28.129696,al512,good but still as flaw,"this is a awesome game the forging mechanique are good just that the level for everything that as a link with crafting or forging as a limit and i think that it is weird 

the fighting mechanique welp good but there a lot of part were if you does something wrong in the time chamber you are well doom to fail or if you just want to test you weapon well sadly you cant leave the time room until your hp are at zero or if you broke all of your weapon

the worst thing in this game is the mining why because there isn't really any mining mechanique at all you just well turn on an old machine and it is slow very slow

i think it would be better to add another way to gain metal and im thinking about someting more interesting than just adding a mine it would be rather a donjon

technically in the game you are stuck in a donjon but i found alway asking myself where is the donjon ? 
and i think adding a door that lead to a randomly generated donjon could be a great add you could build yourself a pickaxe and going with your sword inside the donjon where you could find vein of metal maybe some chest with ramdom loot in it but also 
enemy like squeleton and i also think i could goes well with the resistence thing that isnt still implemented in the game because some enemy could have poisoned weapon or some of them could use magic

sorry for my english im french
and i love this game it's that it could be better with a real mining experience and it could even have a real donjon",Jan 5 at 1:19 AM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:57:28.143659,Name110,Unplayable waste of money,"At the very start of this piece of garrbage called a game the locomotion was normal, like boneworks pavlov BUT FOR SOME STUPID GOD DAMM REASON THE GAME DECIDED TO MAKE MY CHARCTER RUN AND KEEP ME IN PLACE NOT EVEN TURNING THIS GAME IS QUITE LITTEALY UNPLAYABLE ITS WORSE THEN MY GOD DAMM SPELLING AND THAT LOW",Dec 5 at 4:20 AM,1, 3,
2022-05-28 20:57:28.158619,NomadicMango,love this game but...,"This is one of the best VR games I have played to date but it does have a couple of things that they could add to make it a little better like in addition to the machine that mines for you I wish there was a way for you to make a pickaxe and mine yourself and upgrade it to be able to mine better materials. Also, I think you should not make dexterity a skill you have to use your bonus skill on you should just make it so that your level of let say smithing goes up slowly so that there is no need for a dexterity skill so that you don't have to put some of your levels into dexterity just forge weapons to level that aspect up gradually.","Jun 27, 2021 at 6:28 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:57:28.172582,JoeWilmington,Grand ol' game,"Really good game, very enjoyable. While the tutorial leaves a lot to be desired, everything you need to know is in your smithing book, and literally on the wall next to the forge. If you have even half a brain, there should be no problem in understanding what needs to be done. Enough ranting, the smithing aspect of the game is just amazing, putting in mined ores, smelting them, then forging them into weapons..it's just cool. I also like the idea of an automatic mining system. Slowly upgrading your ''miner'' to speed the whole process up, getting more ore, it's really cool. Overall great game, but you have to be interested in smithing (obviously).","Jan 10, 2021 at 7:20 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:57:31.296227,Jaybe3,The VR game I have been looking for!,I have wanted to be a blacksmith for as long as I can remember. Living in an apartment complex hinders my dream but this game helps scratch the itch of wanting to craft blades. I can not wait until more updates come along. Seeing different types of damascus added would be amazing but not sure how plausable. Having the ability to mine yourself and build up some points in stamana and strength would also be cool way to level up some. Keep up the great work. Back to smithing I go!,"Jan 6, 2021 at 7:15 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:57:31.311187,r1pper671992,Great game with unreal physics / support,I love this game it is a bit grindy but thats what makes it fun you gotta think about everything and how different items can be used. The smithing portion is exciting to see what i can make and the mine is interesting to watch. After getting some questions answered it only made the game more fun because it would give me goals to go for to get certain items.,"Jan 4, 2021 at 12:10 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:57:31.326147,myaltcharacter007,Good Idea - Fails on Basics,"The weapon smith is a great concept but it ends there.

Tutorial of disembodied head is painful uninformative and very slow and cant be skipper through.

Dropped weapons cannot be picked up, cannot enter room to earn exp to progress without basic weapon(dropped), cant start mining process as cant earn time crystals (required to mine). 

Has bow functionality but does not fire where aimed (Played ""walk on arrow"" and other similar games without issue) 

This is Early access, so im hoping this is addressed and can test after fixed, do not recomend in current state Dec 2020.","Dec 2, 2020 at 3:11 PM",1, 0,"We apologise that you had a bad play experience.
However this review contains misleading information:
Swords can be picked up, and will infact auto pickup if you walk away.
All parts of the tutorial can be skipped and come back to at any time.
Bow is completely working."
2022-05-28 20:57:31.341106,spacewheatley,coins vanishing,I love this game I've played for hours but every time i leave the game after saveing when i come back all my red coins are gone just the red ones sop far i had like 6 and then poof gone,"Dec 14, 2020 at 10:01 AM",3, 1,"This issue is now fixed.  Please see the new update released today: (dec 22, 2020)"
2022-05-28 20:57:31.356066,Gemini000,Now THIS Is Freaking Fun!,"Despite being in early access as of this review, this game is LOADED! Supports multiple methods of locomotion and while there's a number of minor issues strewn througout none of them negatively affect the experience. I have a very small play area for roomscale yet the concept of a conveyor rolling targets to you allows me to play this without risking breaking through my boundaries! The forging is VERY in-depth as well and helps break up the exercise of slashing at targets. Don't expect to just boot this and play for a little, this is designed to be played a couple or three hours at a time over a long stretch! :B","Sep 24, 2020 at 9:46 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:57:34.473728,GrumpyOx,Exactly what I've been looking for!,"Ooh boy is it fun, and super interactive. Casting ingots, crafting handles and arrows, wacking dummies and targets with a sword and bow made with your own two hands- seriously, I've been dreaming of a game like this since I got vr, and im so glad I found this! Plays well and looks great! Amazing what you get and they're not even done with the game! Only things I can really say against it is that it is a little grindy to get to the next smithing book, the targets sometimes go balistic and count against my health even if its out of my control, and the tutorial ghost was a bit hard to hear. 
Even if you're just a little curious give it a shot. But be careful- It WILL suck you in!","Aug 30, 2020 at 10:57 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:57:34.488688,CasuallyDrunk,Fun game but needs work.,"I have a lot of fun with this game and I have been messing around with it on my Rift S but when i go to the range and have to do the bow segments, it never seems like my arrow wants to go in the bow. 
All for all......amazing game and I like that I have no idea what I'm doing. It adds to the fun.","Aug 29, 2020 at 11:25 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:57:34.503648,AbyssSlayer99,Love the game!,Love the game its fun to craft and fight. Only issue I really have is not being able to change what hand the sheild goes on,"Sep 28, 2020 at 6:40 AM",5, 2,"Hi AbyssSlayer.  To switch to left handed mode: equip the sword to your opposite hip. This will switch sword and shield hands and tool belt, etc."
2022-05-28 20:57:34.517611,Mithrans,,"I own about 50 VR games and this is the first time i feel i must write a review. This is one of the best game i've played, and it's still in early access. I haven't encountered many bugs (only one crash when i tried to save the game with a stamp.) I am lucky to be playing in a big room, because i sometimes forget i am playing a game. Totally worth the money.","Jun 30, 2020 at 3:24 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:57:34.532571,PancakeLord69,pretty fun but has flaws,"It has an amazing concept but has lots of flaws 
for example if your not the height of the main character you will be crouching.
Also not very polished (Not much of a roadblock) 
its a very fun concept and with enough inprovment could be amazing
Also the combat is quite lackluster 
making stuff is pretty fun its very creative 
mining is also pretty fun
altogether its a game with flaws but has great potential.","Jun 19, 2020 at 2:45 AM",4, 13,"Thanks for the feedback on the crouching issue, we will fix this issue ASAP.

The battle system is being constantly being updated - stay tuned for updates expanding this system with bosses and more enemy types, rewards and challenges!"

2022-05-28 20:57:37.648237,Jelly_xy,FAVORITE!,"I will give this 5 stars because i love it so much but i A. cant find and have no idea what some of the potions do, a guide would be appreciated somewhere the google steam and wiki page seemed like dead ends to me. and B. either the pristine weapons update doesnt work for me or hasnt been released on oculus like it was on steam which would make me very sad. I yearn for all of those aspects minus breaking while cooling parts. THATS HORRIFYING *edit Thank you so much for the response! I cant begin to explain how greatful i am to hear from you! Looking forward to it!","Jul 11, 2020 at 1:44 PM",5, 0,"This build is up to parity with steam now. (update 10).

2022-05-28 20:57:37.663197,Ellyrian,good game. little confused of mehcanics,"this game is fun and time consuming, i am i little confused on my i can't forge. when i try to hammer a metal to make a peice of a sword is says my forging skill is to low and i dont know how to upgrade it.","Jul 4, 2020 at 5:41 AM",4, 1,"The smithing book lists ""possible"" and ""trivial"" for smithing the blade, you must be above possible to smith it. Start with an easier blade to build up your smithing skill."
