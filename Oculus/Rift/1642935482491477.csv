2022-05-28 19:39:34.873781,Fleetwood270,SubStandard,We know 360 video still suffers from poor resolution. But when you make a 5 minute 360 video of outdated computergraphics you're only going off the deep end  of what is acceptable. The thought of people actually trying to get away with selling this is even more horrible than the creepy face in the video. This should haven been rendered realtime in todays levels of graphics to legitimize asking the 99 cents. Even for the Maas brand it's a move named after his dad.  This should not have been allowed to pass quality control at Oculus. ( all puns intended ),"Apr 7, 2018 at 7:45 AM",1, 20,
2022-05-28 19:39:34.888741,FastLawyer,Good student art project,"So this has the look and feel of a A+ university student group project. However, as a commercial product on the Oculus store it has a fatal flaw. Most of the visuals are blurry and/or can be described as jagginess. These visual problems are very noticeable and make the experience difficult to look at in VR. Is it possible to ignore the jaggies? Sure. But it's really hard to do so. It's a shame because this was a well-directed movie short and the sound effects are really good. I liked the music too. But if you're doing a cinematic VR experience, the visuals should be pleasant to look at.","Apr 6, 2018 at 12:08 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 19:39:34.903701,VirtuaLieven,Not bad / nicht schlecht,"This 3D-movie experience is not bad, but you should not expect too much. It's very well done, a nice slightly cary story and nice to watch so a good thing to show a first VR-experience. The quality of the graphics is ""just okay"", the only thing I was missing to give it five stars is that it's not real 3D.
But before you criticize more: remember this has been made by students, and that was in 2015, in the beginning of VR. Definitely worth the low price, even if you watch it only once.","Apr 10, 2018 at 4:03 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:39:34.918661,Przemo-c,Very impressive,"Really nice but short experience. The resolution is not all there therre is banding and jaggedness the instances where music isn't as loud reveals lack od positional audio. It shows its date.

But overall it's a stunning video I'd love to see more recent works from creators of this great piece of work.","Apr 7, 2018 at 8:58 PM",4, 2,
