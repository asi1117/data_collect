2022-05-28 17:50:46.793243,razedfist,heres some things devs can do,"If you like FIFA then try this out its FIFA but the AI are worse, you have less controls and you can't be a goalie. 

Here's some things the devs can do/improve.
--------------------------------------------------
-Make a aim assister for the realistic one (i mean make a things where you can see where you shoot)

-Make it so you can be a goal keeper.

-Focus on the realistic one a bit more.

-Make the AI good because I get like 8-13 goals a match and the keepers are meh but the outfielders are worse.

-Make graphics better for realistic (I know its hard because its in early access but please make it a bit better.)

-Make skills.


Over all I say this game is a 7.5/10  I recomened to try it its only 8 pounds.

I have never got nausea from this only minor headaches when i play this for 6+ hours","May 27, 2020 at 3:42 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 17:50:46.808203,Renemouse,Not Fifa but...,"Realism mode, which I bought the game for, is currently very much a work in progress (which they are up front about). Games are very VERY easy.  Ther's no crosses, headers, volleys, skills, etc. Goalkeepers rarely use their hands or even get anywhere near the ball; AI goalies tend to dribble half the length of the pitch on the rare occasion they do make a save. 

The blocky mode (Minecraft graphics) has clearly had much more attention although I didn't enjoy it much. It's cartoony, arcade style soccer but for me the style grated, the players didn't respond as I expected, and it wasn't particularly enjoyable. Others may find it more fun. and it's probably much better in multiplayer - a big positive is that you can play local multiplayer with or without VR.

There are a ton of camera options, incluing one for a fixed camera.  Idid not feel motion sick using the side view cameras, which are the same as in most soccer games. There is also a behind the player view, which put the camera in front of the player(??) but wasn't fun to play with. 

Honestly for how little it costs, it's... alright. You can use VorpX with Fifa but that's gonna cost you $60 for Fifa and $30 for VorpX - if you just want to see the novelty of 3d VR soccer this is good enough.","Jan 19, 2018 at 10:50 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 17:50:46.823163,FastLawyer,Fun arcade soccer game,"First of all, this game has a lot of options to play with.  The option I liked the most was to change the pixel art to realistic looking players.  The difference was jaw dropping, this game looks very good if you get rid of the pixel art style.  There's lots of player options, multiplayer.  The only problem is that the AI (enemy and your own team) is not very good.  I easily won most matches 10-0.  Still, it was a lot of fun and I can imagine the game would be more fun against other players.  For 5 dollars, this is a hidden gem must buy.  BTW, I played for about 30 minutes with no nausea or problems viewing the game action whilst playing.","Aug 13, 2017 at 3:03 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:50:46.838123,Lt.Loony,NES nostalgia,"I really enjoyed World Cup on the 8-bit Nintendo and this is a bit like it. The graphics are definately the same, but more players on the field. There is also 2 modes with more realistic graphics, but this fails to shine in any direction. My advice is they keep working on the cartoony part as there is for sure some fun to be had there if polished a bit more.","Aug 10, 2017 at 1:48 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 17:50:46.853084,chrismarble85,Eh,"Gameplay is very reminescent of NES style sports games, and the art style is pretty cool. However, I experienced a good deal of nausea without a locked camera.","Dec 1, 2016 at 7:07 AM",2, 5,
