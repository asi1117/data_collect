2022-05-28 19:23:24.434568,RuneSR2,Best player for the Rifts - by far!,"Not sure why all the bad reviews here, this player is beyond amazing. More than 300 free videos available, and much more with Infinity.
Seems some users had trouble registering for this app, but for a start you don't need to register. You can just choose to take a quick tour without signing in, and all the free videos will be fully available.
Before starting the app, I did register using the Viveport website, and then I could just sign in, no big deal. 
The Touch controllers work perfectly in this app - and I got highly detailed models of the Rift CV1 Touch controllers depicted inside this app, nice! Sound was incredible with the CV1 headphones, but Viveport Video may support some special kind of spatial audio?
Now that the once great app Oculus Video has been removed from the Oculus Store, I'm really thankful for HTC to provide this amazing alternative, which isn't a substitute, but even a big improvement! 
Love the tiny dust particles in the air, and the theater is simply gorgeous. Nice that the screen adapts to the correct format. And several videos are supported in both 2k and 4k. 
Note that some of the free Vimeo videos don't just show short films, but some of the most amazing short films in the world. Some have even been nominated for Oscars.
Thanks HTC!
Btw, I tested the app using Rift CV1 ss 2.0 with a RTX 3090, i9 10900K and 32GB ram.","Jun 15, 2021 at 2:04 AM",5, 4,

Wasn't able to sign in or create an account because there was no way i could interact with the menu(neither mouse nor oculus controllers were registered by the software).,"Sep 26, 2019 at 10:42 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:23:27.596112,Space_Being,6DOFlite mode is a game changer,"The new 6DOFlite mode in the latest update is a potential game changer.  It allows for head and even body movement within the video which makes for a more comfortable and realistic viewing experience.  But... there's still some work to be done.  

Note for the Devs: While I certainly felt a new freedom in being able to move my head and seeing the environment adjust properly, in some videos I would see a dramatic shift (mostly in background elements) even though I had only walked a step or two, which ruined immersion for me.  It did not feel realistic.   Focus your algorithms on providing a better understanding of depth of space and objects within the scene. Distinction between foreground, middle ground and background components is something that is crucial for immersion.

But kudos for introducing 6DOF video viewing, and I look forward to seeing it develop!  You guys are certainly taking the lead here and pushing VR video forward.","Jul 18, 2019 at 4:53 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:23:27.612069,MrNeeds,Just a big advertising platform,"Before you can use this app, it asks you to sign up with a big banner to your left asking if you want vveport infinity, and it directs you to the viveport website through your web browser, once there, you sign up with all the usual information, then gets you to try to buy viveport infinity once again (with no obvious way to bypass), you click the x in the corner (which blends in with the pop up btw), and you verify your email, it then redirects you to viveport infinity again and asks you to pay, you can now close it down and pop on your VR headset, you open up viveport, sign in, and low and behold, you're sat in a cinema (theatre for the US folks) with a persistent screen to your right advertising viveport infinity, which you cannot remove, it's incredibly distracting 100% of the time, I wouldn't even mind but I only downloaded it to play a sbs movie, and it can't even do that well with no option to switch images for sbs left to right, instead of right to left, useless!","Jun 4, 2019 at 8:01 PM",2, 18,"Thanks for your feedback, we hear you and are always making improvements to our product.
