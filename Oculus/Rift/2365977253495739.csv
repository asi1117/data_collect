The game is split into a tactical phase on the spaceship where you place towers (lots of types to choose from with a variety of different effects to counter the different enemies) and a battle phase where you get dropped onto the level and actually fight the enemy alongside your towers. Instead of just getting a single bow(which is also included) the game provides a variety of different weapons. Though it starts slow at the beginning, while progressing the story lots of cool guns get unlocked. The enemies are also plenty, with new types appearing every level of the campaign. It is also nice they have an actual story leading you through the game. While it's apparent it is an indie production, it was nice to see something which is more than just the game mechanics. While the graphics surely can not compete with large studios, you can see they made the best of what they had and the game looks rather nice for a VR title. Overall the game was quite fun and fitting for its price range","Jun 10, 2020 at 12:06 AM",5, 6,
