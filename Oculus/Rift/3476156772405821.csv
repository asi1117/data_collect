2022-05-28 20:15:53.212503,Ghostrider55307,Fun game,The gameplay is good but using the tools is a bit wonky. It just makes it look like your holding it (the tools still work btw) but once you get the hang of it the game is pretty good,May 1 at 10:08 PM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:15:53.227462,thelizzyparable,I used to love it...,"I started playing the game back in Dec 2020. After I had done quite a bit on it, I took a very long break from VR as a whole. Getting back into it now, and Harvest no longer works. It boots up but once I repeatedly select new game over and over again and nothing ever happens. It used to be the best little farming simulator type game in VR. I miss it and wish I could continue to play. My rating would change if it would just work.",Mar 9 at 2:28 AM,2, 0,"Hi! Too bad the game isn't working for you! This means your save file is broken, which is most likely fixable though! Please send it to us so we can fix it for you! Join our discord so we can discuss this."

I cant beleave they are just giving it away for free. I would have paid for this cute game. I really hope that the Devs keep working on it and keep adding more and more. This could be a HUGE HIT after it grows a bit. LOVE IT!! Great job Devs keep it up, PLEASE.","Nov 21, 2020 at 4:02 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:15:56.398131,Willard007,Fun and needs improvements (updated).,"I have purchased everything, so it must be time to create the mine and maybe get some hens unless any or all of the chickens with traditionally male names are actually hens because I don’t see any eggs.  Is there a garbage pickup or am I supposed to deposit the cans and bottles in a food depository?  I found a hat on the beach and, when I got home, it was already in my cabinet but also in my backpack so now I have two.  I left a bag of seeds on the ground because I found that each morning, everything would reappear in its place but I also had a bag of the same seeds in my backpack so then I had two bags of those seeds.  I found a rocket in a tree and not sure what to do with it or the beachball I found.  Have not tried to pick up the surfboards yet.  Somehow, a ladder to get to the 2nd story of your house seems a bit out of place.  I mean, you have a stove and refrigerator and you have stairs to get into the house.  When planting the seeds, if holding them in my right hand, the bag would drop out of my hand when I turned.  This may have been because I was holding something else, possibly the backpack, in my left hand.  The biggest problem I had was exiting the game.  It didn’t seem to want close or I just didn’t know how to close it.  I got it to disassociate itself from the Oculus Rift eventually but I had to remove the headset to force close the app on the computer because I now had the big oval with the exclamation point requiring me to do something at the keyboard.  Just as a note, however, I did save my place in the game just before trying to exit.  Not sure if that might be relevant.  It is kind of a fun game and might get you a little exercise when having to reach down to pick some of the vegetables.  I had to stop playing when the timer on my real stove told me dinner was ready but I spent a good 4 hours playing and it was dark when I removed my headset.

I saw there was an update, so decided to play some more.  I see that the chickens now lay eggs, though I realized that there is one feeding tray for each chicken which, when seeded with feed, will trigger the eggs to start developing.  I saw the additions in the carpentry store which included buying the kitchen I used to have but that’s ok.  It makes sense to have it purchased separately.  I bought the greenhouse and planted some flowers and once I realized which one paid the best, I stuck with that one for the next crop.  When they were fully grown, for some reason, I was unable to teleport in the midst of them like I had when I had a row of each.  Eventually, it worked out.  I purchased the windmill and realized it was just a decoration for now so it might be better to buy an addition to the greenhouse first.  I’m happy that you can now grab the entire stack of whatever item you have harvested in your basket or pack.  I found another hat for a total of four, so far.  I’m glad the mine is now open and you can get money for what you dig up.  Unfortunately, there is still no clean way to exit the game, though I was able to do it without removing my headset by using the soft keyboard and closing the game from the Start bar.  Another thing I forgot to mention last time was that I could not figure out how to get the Guide book found on the bed to open, though there is a start button on it.","Nov 23, 2020 at 7:47 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 20:15:56.412093,yaichy,Fun and nice concept,I like the concept and I look forward to purchase your game. I wish graphics were better though. Also at the start it is not clear what to do. May be some kind of task list would be helpful.,"Nov 28, 2020 at 10:41 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:15:56.428051,katomega,"Surprisingly enjoyable, despite issues","I spent 20 minutes crawling around my floor picking carrots. I'm not sure why I find this enjoyable, but I do! The enivronment is charming, the townsfolk have cute faces, you can pick apples, and there's even a hat!

But I have some notes...
Your tools will get stuck in the ground, so when moving around it is best to hold your hand straight up to prevent them from glitching into the terrain.

Longer tools from the dispenser will sometimes glitch through the walls of the shed.

When on the simulated time mode, the timers for watering the crops are not accurate.

I wish I could turn the basket upside down to empty it into the sale bin. Picking carrots is fun, but spending 5 minutes pulling them out of the basket one by one is not so fun.

I know I have money, because I was able to buy tools in the town, but I cannot find a backpack, or purse, or any kind of money count, so I don't know how to tell when I'll be able to buy a coop so I can get those sweet sweet chickens...","Oct 7, 2020 at 2:15 AM",4, 11,Hi! Thanks for the feedback. The next update will actually include interactive tutorials which teach you about the backpack and wallet. You already have the backpack from start! Just reach over your shoulder and pull the grab button to grab your backpack :) Same goes for the wallet. It's in your breast pocket. If you look down you can probably see the wallet floating there.

If it is already possible, the option of this important setting should be highlighted better ;-)","Oct 12, 2020 at 12:20 AM",4, 8,
