2022-05-28 19:41:54.409082,AlexLen,Boring and repetettive,The arch mechanics are not near as good as they should be for such a fast game unfortumately. The invironments and the  creatures are repettetive and plain.,"Apr 1, 2019 at 5:00 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:41:54.425040,REIZOD,Fun Game,"Overall it's a very fun game.  Simple basic and straight forward wave/horde type of shooter.  It would have been great to have some different type of bows or powers, and levels.

This game is worth the price and is a must buy for anyone that love archery!","Jan 6, 2019 at 2:27 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:41:54.439999,Kevin_Brook,Archery wave shooter with style,"I recently reviewed this game for VRFitness Insider. You can see the full review at https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/review/bardo-vr-game-review-stylish-wave-based-archery-shooter/

For the price I really enjoyed the game. Very pleasing to look at, and the sounds are really well done. It's certainly addictive and compels you to keep coming back for one more go. I really hope the developers continue to develop this and add more weapons and abilities. If you like bow shooters and are looking for something cheap and cheerful favouring simple playability over depth of content then you will enjoy this!","Dec 4, 2018 at 10:47 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:41:54.455956,SpaceSteggy,Can't Stop Playing,This game is absolutely fantastic. The graphics are incredible and runs perfectly on a fairly older PC of mine. I was honestly expecting it to not hit acceptable frames because of my hardware but it never sputters. The Boss fight had me smiling for sure! The feel of the bow and firing off arrows is superb. The controls let me switch back and forth between hands which is nice because of fatigue. I literally stop when I can no longer raise my arms. Great Job! Would HIGHLY recommend!,"Oct 3, 2018 at 2:46 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 19:41:54.470916,Shaydaz,How an archery game should be done,"From the moment you step into Bardo you are put into character, the tutorial starts and you navigate the menus by shooting them with the bow. The whole experience feels seemless.

The controls are great and intuitive, you can draw arrows how you'd expect and the feedback you get in terms of sound and vibration are very satisfying. 
You have a few abilities that help you deal with the onslaught of monsters and they feel very natural too.

I always go into games like this worried for left handed gamers, but Bardo does it perfectly. The bow actually gets mirrored when swapping hands unlike some titles. This allows all the details to be visible, which is important as there is no HUD, the decorations on the bow adjust to let you know your health, magic and cooldowns, which again makes the title feel very natural and helps with immersion

Audio is very good in this game. The cues are fantastic, I was never looking at the meters, you can tell everything from sound alone. Also each enemy has a unique entry line so you can tell what threats have entered the arena without having to swing your head around constantly.

The only gripe I have with the title is the checkpoint system and the difficulty could be improved. Whenever I failed it would be on the level of the checkpoint which I found quite demoralising as I'd have to replay the last 5 waves again. Perhaps with a tweak to difficulty it would help get the ""one more try"" feeling.

In terms of how tiring this title can be, it starts off nice and easy but by halfway through youre frantically firing arrows as fast as you can manage. I did find myself a little short of breath a few times.

I won't spoil anything but the boss fight is epic. 
I hope they give us some more content once this leaves the early access, I want more big epic enemies, more themed enemies, challenges etc. Just give me more Bardo!","Sep 17, 2018 at 10:45 PM",5, 16,
