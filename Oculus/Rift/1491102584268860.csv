2022-05-28 16:18:13.735653,Tybern,A most excellent experience,"Absolutely delightful. Excellently constructed environments, with an appropriate and immersive score to go with them. One of the most polished VR experiences I've encountered.","Dec 27, 2020 at 5:24 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:18:13.778539,Zoobley,Quick fun experience,"This is more of an experience than a game. Cool environment and good showcase of how light and sound can impact an environment. Bought it on sale and wouldn't pay full price, maybe $5 or so. Puzzles weren't very hard but visually enjoyable.","Oct 27, 2020 at 5:32 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 16:18:13.794496,jeli_belli,Incredible Experience!,"This game is more like a work of art than a game. Each level was designed out of this world amazing! Although the puzzles were fairly easy and it is only about 30 minutes of gameplay, it left me wanting so so sooooooo much more! I really hope we get a FORM 2 with more intricate puzzles and longer gameplay. Even if you don't like puzzles, I recommend trying this experience anyway because it truly is a visual masterpiece.","Apr 2, 2020 at 9:13 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 16:18:16.922131,DuraMorte,Incredible! Just need more!,"This game isn't so much a game as it is an experience.
A truly mesmerizing visual style, combined with incredible soundscapes and beautiful sci-fi visuals, creates a masterpiece of epic proportions.

Absolutely worth the price, and then some. 

I only wish it were longer so I would have more to enjoy!","Mar 31, 2020 at 8:57 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:18:16.937090,Sarxis,Just so cool!,"Quite the imaginative experience.  Puzzles are light enough not to cause frustration, but interesting enough to delight the soul.

21/10 would transcend again.","Apr 29, 2020 at 4:42 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:18:16.951053,Digikid1,Simply AMAZING!!!!!,"Yes it is a short experience....but it was amazing to say the least.  The visuals, the ease of play....all was perfectly natural.  I can only hope that they will make this into a full-fledged game.  Comes on sale often though so get it then.  I got it for just under $10.00CDN.

Well done!!!!!

UPDATE:  This game is still quite amazing and I love it to pieces.  However are there any plans to bring it to the Quest?","Jan 17, 2020 at 8:22 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:18:16.966014,PlayroomVandals,Not as compelling as it could have been,"Short experience. Mostly interacting with knobs and buttons from a static position.

2022-05-28 16:18:16.980973,Azelroth,Excellent game. Intuitive puzzles.,"I found FORM to be an easy pick-up-and-play game. The puzzles were intuitive and I found them to be enjoyable. The graphics and scenes are an excellent demo on what VR should be like. The only downside is that the entire game is easy to finish and most will find themselves wanting more even after it's over.

An excellent title to pick up if it's on sale. I'd recommend it. To the devs please consider expanding upon the base game and adding in new scenes or alternative additional puzzles to enjoy. Thanks.","Dec 20, 2019 at 7:42 PM",4, 3,

Very immersive, puzzles are not very hard so not frustrating. A must have in your lib to convince people to come into VR ! thank you to developers for their quick answer to my problem ;)

2022-05-28 16:18:23.286109,virpi32,"Awesome, but with minor flaws","Visually stunning game with exceptional level and audio design. The puzzles are simple and logical, the only one I really didn't like was assembling the mirror because I first thought I had to attach the parts to the pedestal. But maybe I'm stupid, I don't know. The ""chord"" puzzle, on the other hand, was one of the best experiences I've had so far in VR. There's no real story to the game, even though there are hints. It leaves a lot to the imagination of the player, which is fine for me. Overall, a definite recommendation to everyone who's new to VR. Get it in a sale, it's well worth 10 Euro (or the equivalent in your currency.)","Oct 30, 2019 at 4:22 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 16:18:23.301070,Dupes,"Good intro to VR, but limited as a game","I found FORM to have great visuals. If you are brand new to the VR, its a great experience. It's still good if you've used VR for a bit, but the puzzles are fairly limited and the gameplay short. I finished this game in a single 1 hour session.","Nov 5, 2019 at 11:39 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 16:18:23.315032,drokle,Great but short,"Graphics, audio, atmosphere, mechanics, puzzle variety and difficulty were all about perfect for me. As mentioned in other reviews, the only bad things are the length and the story resolution. It only took me about 30 minutes to play through. I played it twice to make sure I didn't miss anything and even went to watch walk through videos on youtube to make sure. There is what appears to start out as a very in depth story which never gets resolved. I'm glad I played it but also very glad I got this on sale. Hope they add to the story with updates or another episode or something.","Sep 7, 2019 at 12:34 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:18:26.442666,LunarKnight2112,Great game but SOOOOO Short,The game design is wonderful and the controls are very easy to understand and work with...after all they are just hands. The puzzles had been very fun but the largest disapointment for the price I paid even on sale is that the game just ends. For me I cannot give more stars because it took me about 25 minutes to complete all the puzzles and then I played it a second time thinking I missed something only to complete it even faster still. If they add onto the game at no additional charge I would gladly play it more but at this time I wish I could get my money back as BANG for BUCK is not there at all for me.,"Aug 15, 2019 at 8:47 AM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 16:18:26.457626,goesBang,Very polished experience,"First - this kind of puzzle games is not my cup or tea. But it was in a sales package and so I played it. I liked it.

But it's very short - it took me like 1 hour and I didn't hurry. And you cannot really play it differently afterwards, it's a linear puzzle game - so repeating it doesn't give you anything.

On the positive side, it feels very polished and has great visuals and sound! The alien designs and effects, some organic  moving tech stuff, just great. It wasn't boring - but it's short. More like a 1 hour concept / art demo then a real game, just like many VR games right now. The puzzles are quite easy, just try poking around and it gets clear quite fast.

All this short games are just too expensive when they are not on sale. Compare this with a tripple A game for 50 euros...for weeks and weeks of fun.","Sep 25, 2019 at 2:05 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 16:18:26.472587,Gh0ul,WAY TOO SHORT,"While i will admit that the style and soudtrack are amazing the actual content of the game is very lacking. All of the puzzles that i encountered in the game were so simple and straightforward taht i honestly was rather bored when i actually tried to solve them. The game's ending is rather abrupt as well and answer's none of the questions that were raised during the experience. While i will give credit to the devs for the style, soundtrack and being able to make a game like this with a fairly small team, i would still say that this game is not worth the $15 price tag.

tl;dr
Pros: 
Facinating intro sequence
Great atmosphere
Good graphics
Mesmerizing soundtrack

Cons:
Very easy difficulty
Incredibly short
Leaves things unresolved
A little overpriced for what you get","Jul 22, 2019 at 9:30 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 16:18:26.487546,tommosaur,A brilliant letdown,"This is an exceptional audio and visual tour de force. After a brief sequence in the regular world, it takes one into an extremely abstract environment with one physics/audio interaction puzzle after the other. I'll be honest: Usually as soon as i hear puzzle and VR combined, i often get turned off. Why? Because there is nothing more frustrating to me than being in VR and getting stuck on something and not being able to progress, it gets annoying and boring to me way more quickly than already for regular screen content, since i'm in that different space and want to explore and experience something progressing, not get stuck in the same area with no way to go on.
But this is great in all puzzles besides one for which i had to look up the solution.
(one has to move sliders to the right level, totally random seeming)
But all others?
They are a masterclass in how to design fun intuitive user interfaces on a level of its own. Presenting something which is intentionally entirely mindwarpingly different and alien and at the same time also so excellently designed that the solution almost instantly presents itself with the most intuitive interaction attempt one would try and which all responses of the system guide one towards.
Visual and audio cues are forming a mesmerizing constant feedback loop.

I could go on and on praising such aspects.
All those i love and again, they are exemplary besides one small exception.

Now the two aspects i did not like which took away from it a bit:
1.: Despite being (besides one exception) very well designed, there is no aid for when one would actually get stuck. 
2.: The story was not resolved at all, while initially it felt like uncovering a mystery, it was left all unended, maybe i missed something which would wrap up the story but that was a big letdown.

Still a great thing to experience.","Jul 7, 2019 at 8:01 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:18:26.502506,superpozition,"Soooo beautiful, but yet another puzzle","For the 5 millionth VR puzzle game out there, it’s by far the best. The mechanics of animations of the puzzles will blow your mind. It’s absolutely beautiful too.

I can’t play it again because I’m getting puzzle sick from all the million VR puzzles out there, puzzling the puzzle piss out of my puzzletiss. See? No fun when you hear the same thing over and over with a tiny spin on it.","Jul 6, 2019 at 7:01 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:18:29.592242,JeremyC85,Nothing really like in it VR,There really isn't anything like this out there... very abstract puzzle solving game with great mechanics and great graphics. Its a standing experience that takes roughly an hour and isn't ever too difficult. Does a GREAT job of showing off what VR can do. I got it on sale but would say its worth the full 15$,"Jul 3, 2019 at 8:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:18:29.606205,Giacamo,Gorgeous but too easy.,"The game looks spectacular, but none of the puzzles are even remotely challenging, and the story is barely an introduction which ends super abruptly with the game after two hours of gameplay. It's a really cool experience, but a totally underwhelming game.","Jul 13, 2019 at 11:27 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 16:18:29.621165,john.c.linstrum,Great Little VR Experience,"The game lasts about an hour or so, and is really an experience as much as it is a game. Honestly, by the end of the hour I'd about had enough of it, but it was a pretty cool hour, so the length of it is about right. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Also, I found it to have a pretty high comfort level, and I get VR sick pretty easy.","Jul 3, 2019 at 1:44 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 16:18:29.636125,Hanover,The Room in VR,"This reminded me of The Room in VR.  It's a short, but fun experience.  You're a scientist playing around with a Monolith and get pulled into it's little world where you solve various puzzles, most of them experimenting with mechanical contraptions.  You can get through it within an hour or so.  I've enjoyed going through the experience a couple of times.  Well worth the money as it's VR done correctly.","Jun 24, 2019 at 4:22 AM",4, 4,

It might only take you 1.5 - 2hrs to get thru this, but this game transports you into the story's world. The design of the puzzles & environments were well thought out. As I was going through it, I was thinking ""how do you even come up with this stuff""? Thank you too the devs for bringing this into the world!!!","Dec 24, 2018 at 4:14 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:18:35.915331,rh_galaxy,Worth it on sale,Finished it in 2 hours.

2022-05-28 16:18:35.929293,Mancomb_Seepgood,Phenominal Puzzler left me wanting more.,"For me, Form is one of the best puzzler games in VR I have played. The design of the puzzles with the surrounding scenes changing shapes had me captivated. 

The only real setback was how short the game actually is. I was able to get to the credits in about an hour and a half.

Over all well worth the money.","Oct 11, 2018 at 6:53 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 16:18:35.944254,Oli_XRehab,,"This would actually be a two stars, but I feel someone has to counterbalance the huge and injustified praise this game gets. While it is an interesting environment, very claustrophobic and dark, the game is so so easy that it's painful. I raced through the puzzles, the story was incomprehensible and felt like it was stuck together cheaply. And worst of all it was really short, finished it in one hour. 
If anyone has ever played The Room 1 and 2, it's much better and so much longer (unfortunately it's not in VR). 
Not recommended for more than 5 Euro.","Oct 16, 2018 at 1:57 AM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 16:18:35.974173,TechDiva,Awesome Mind Jerk,"This was an incredible mind jerk. I wasnt sure if I was playing the game or if the game was playing me.  This was one of the most incredible experiences that I have had in my LIFE.  I actually forgot that I was playing a ""game"" from time to time and felt myself in the afterlife wrapping up this journey with a series of logical tasks given by aliens, angels or some more intelligent/higher power.  Not only did each puzzle/task have to be figured out but the games (puzzles) force you to figure out that you need to figure it out!  The only thing that I suggest to the devs is to give us MORE! The graphics were intense. Great job!!!","Aug 19, 2018 at 1:06 PM",5, 11,

This is a very well done game and you can tell the devs put a lot of love and passion into this. Very polished. I have to say one of the things that shines on the Rift is when dark scenes are done well - scenes that utilize the OLED screen to really immerse you in real darkness. This game does that so well.

you aren't just doing the same things the whole game, it is like you are being tested on your rational intelligence by some higher alien consciousness.

I  reloaded my saved game and this time answered 'Yes' to see 'therapist ?  and/but I immediately heard a loud NO! yelled at me, and then the same thing as before the room sort of in a null mode,..With credits I think n the menu,.. Maybe it is a further test?  I hop e thre is more but it was  LOT for the money, I'm very satisfied,  I will definately do it again, I was kind of play acting and being a 'WIZARD GUY' etc.,.. Whoosh this! and Zoom that!  Don't forget to stop and smell the transistors with your toes!   Very cool, very worth the price of entry, ALSO: VERY WORTH SHOWING FRIENDS Especially Smart Ones who happen to Scoff at 'VR""  HEHE.. As a Developer myself I can attest a LOT of work went into this, an almost ALIEN amount of work ;)  My only gripe, is I wish companies would hire a good Character Animator like myself and outsource their NPC's. They have Still Charatcer Cards and Still 3D Meshses for Characters, which in this work just fine, but, things I could design, develop, animate (with Lip Sync and believable acting) in just 1-3 days per character.  It makes SUCH a difference. I would even consider doing some character develoment/animation work just for Credit/Reference!  Robert, My Twitter: @NextWorldVR","Apr 14, 2018 at 10:06 PM",5, 3,

I bought it on sale for 7.49 and it was definitely worth the price.  You would pay the same thing or more for a movie ticket or a combo meal at McDonalds - so I consider the purchase of this game to be money well spent.  One other thing I liked about it is that you can save/load multiple gaming sessions, which is not the case for many other games that I've played.  The game seamlessly auto-saves your progress at the completion of each puzzle. so you don't have to concern yourself with saving your progress.  Just take a seat and enjoy the experience.  I certainly would give this game a 5-star if it was longer and a bit more complex.  But in my option, the experience is worth the full $15 price and even more so at the sale price.","Apr 9, 2018 at 7:26 PM",4, 1,

The puzzles,while quite fun are pretty easy.

It's a reasonable time killer but just too short and too easy.

Now the Negative - I beat the game in maybe 3 hrs. There are only two levels and each one has several puzzles in it. Maybe a few minutes per puzzle. Most if not all puzzles were too easy. The game should be at least double the size for the money if not triple. This seems to be where VR games are at now. The issue is there isn't replay ability like some of the shooters so it needs to be longer so you feel like you got your money's worth. Once you know the solve to the puzzle, not really worth playing again.

Over all - Game is pretty and unique. It is worth picking up but it won't take long to beat, like batman and like batman it is over priced for the size of the game. This is more of a preview to a full game. So for $5 - $8 it is worth snagging, but only going to get a couple of hours out of it.","Dec 14, 2017 at 7:06 AM",3, 3,

The graphics are a Spinal Tap 11. The physics are pretty good. The hands could be dialed in for Oculus Touch better. They feel like they were designed for the Vive or something. Like when you hold the coffee mug, the angle is off, but who gives a $#!+ because you guys are CREATIVE as f@^k!

I love Lone Echo, Grav Lab and Robo Recall and blah, blah, blah... But as a hardcore gamer, I've been waiting for THAT gaming company. Ya know? The 'Atlus', the 'Working Designs', the 'Platinum Games'... the outside the box thinking gamer company. You guys have that feel of a company to be watched. (Possibly worshipped, but you need 2-3 titles for that plivilege) Given the resources and time you guys could really blow gamers balls clean off. Girl balls too. 

I could sit here and nitpick at the game but I don't want to. I'm impressed. Everybody else is just doin' the same $#!+ ad nauseum... ""Oh look! Another f@&kin' wave shooter! So original!"" Getting sick of 'em. And so much content is just uninspired @$$.

Anyway... I'll stop gushing about the game and go get my nipples to chill out. VR needs more creatives like you. I hope you guys keep going. Ignore any hater reviews from #NeedsToGetAClue-istan.

For a game that's advertising itself as a puzzle game there isn't much to figure out - most of the time seems to be spent poking and prodding things trying to find the interaction that the game is expecting of you. Many of the tactile interactions are not satisfying, they are fiddly. There's a frustration in knowing the answer to a puzzle and spending a seemingly long amount of time having to input that answer, like filling in a crossword with a pen that's running out of ink.

A very nice concept and some nice mechanics in there, the few puzzles that did require figuring out were good, and the graphics were nice. For the most part though, it's too simple and frustrating to play in places.","Aug 27, 2017 at 7:07 PM",2, 5,

Puzzles aren't difficult, but they are visually satisfying and use the touch capabilities perfectly. More than the excellent visuals is the SOUND and Music playing around you. It brings it all together. Theres a great simple musical puzzle, not unsimilar to the 'simon' 4 color game. The game's not all that it could have been story wise, and I did have a few functional issues, at least I didn't see clearly how to stop mid-level and save game, and messed it up once having to start all over.. but no big deal.

Seriously, I finished this game in about an hour and none of the puzzles were difficult.  In fact, I solved several of them just by messing around.  You aren't told what to do, so part of the game is just figuring out what the puzzle is.  It's an immersive, innovative puzzle world, although the story lacks any cohesion (I still don't understand what happened).  Worst of all, the game ends suddenly.  I seriously thought I was going to the last chapter of the game, the last puzzle room and instead it was role credits.  WTF?  Well, for the content and price, I just can't fully recommend this game.

The game last 1 1/2 hour if you rush into it, but you will want to play at least another session later.
