2022-05-28 16:51:57.828443,hanan.moiseyev,Great game - must be supported in Quest2,The cable management when changing site in the dingy or moving around the yacht is a nightmare with the rift. Quest2 should be supported for A perfect setup,Jul 7 at 1:00 AM,5, 23,"Thank you for your review! If you can use ""Air Link"" - it might help with cables.

We're developing a Quest native sailing app - MarineVerse Cup - it's currently on the App Lab."
2022-05-28 16:51:57.843404,GARY48750,I don't sail but would like to,I really love this app. I also bought artic and japan to. It  feels real.  I just upgraded to quest 2 and use the link. It's been a little buggy lately on my quest 2. Udating. I would say it's been more that a little buggy lately. I have made attempts to contact support but for some reason I have not heard back from them. I am getting lag on the races making it difficult to compete. I don't get the same lag on a pleasure trip so I guess I can surmise that the server is being taxed but I have no confirmation for that. I am not having the same problems in other apps although I suspect this is a more comprehensive program. I really would appreciate some feedback.,"Mar 4, 2021 at 8:48 PM",4, 11,"Hi GARY48750,

Are you still experiencing issues with racing? Is this in Long/Easy race on in the Daily Race?

We don't really too much on the server in VR Regatta ( not at all for Easy,Quick,Long  Race ) - so those should not be affected by server load."
2022-05-28 16:51:57.859360,ScrewLoose,,"Love it!   Kind of the next step from ""Big Breezy Boat"".   Better scenery,  more instructions if you want to learn sailing, but you don't have to.    One caveat - if you have joysticks (like Thrustmaster) they may interfere with touch controllers.  No big deal if you know about it.

Extremely well done!    I'd buy anything these guys make sight unseen!","Nov 12, 2019 at 9:04 PM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 16:51:57.875317,Lalle75,Too simple and lack of feeling,"I expected more. It's mainly tighten a rope and moving a stick. Without sensing the wind in reality, it's very difficult to react to the situation.
Moving from side to side of the boat is is complicated, because you have to aim at the correct place, teleport, release the triggers, turn arround, grap again... and everthing without ""feeling"" the situation. You cannot give a thing in your hand into the other hand, for not loosing the wind or the direction.
Diagonal sensors are not enough to get a good tracking of your controllers. Maybe it might be better with an Oculus GO, but 2 sensors and an Oculus Rift don't make fun.","Oct 27, 2019 at 10:09 PM",2, 15,"Hey Lalle75! If tracking is an issue, you may try using a joystick on the controller - it needs to be enabled in settings https://imgur.com/a/icMrDnD 

( left controller controls tiller, right controller controls main sail. Game window needs to be in focus ) - if you have multiply controllers plugged in ( like flight sim throttle ) - make sure they are in neutral position or disconnected or try selecting joystick to use in options."
2022-05-28 16:51:57.890278,redtop012000,Impressed,"I have sailed in dinghies all my life, mostly racing and teaching.  Now after 60 years I tend not to sail much these days due to the cold, wet and just the pain of getting ready and putting away.  This program had me racing around bouys in minutes as if I was there.  Excellent program and well worth $9.","Jul 5, 2019 at 10:02 PM",5, 35,
2022-05-28 16:52:00.999960,Tumble73,Very Good,Works good with the Rift S and is a fun and enjoyable game.  But...... why is there no DLC available on Oculus Store and only on Steam??,"Jun 11, 2019 at 1:53 AM",5, 13,"Thank you for the review! Just an update on DLCs - you can now get them on Oculus Store as an in-app purchase. When you select ""Lake in Japan"" or ""Arctic"" on the map, you will be prompted to complete in app purchase. Once accepted, game will start downloading in the background ( it's ~500MB per DLC, so probably best to go for a sail in the meantime :-) )"
2022-05-28 16:52:01.014921,Velocirapture,Floating Whale?,"I was sailing when I saw something rather large floating over the water. When I finally got close.... It's a WHALE!!!  I was able to sail under it! lol.  I took pics but I can't upload them here, apparently. Otherwise, so far this is just an amazing app. Thank you!!!!","Mar 29, 2019 at 12:14 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:52:01.029881,RuneSR2,Best sailing sim on the Rift?,"It really feels like sailing in your own sailboat, amazing! I played sitting in a couch, and sitting left or right affected the boat, like tilting to the left if I sat om the left side. I don't know why the devs recommend a GTX 1070, using a GTX 1080 I cranked up super sampling to 2.0 and never experienced less than 90 fps. Using a GTX 970 or better this sim may work perfectly even using high levels of super sampling! 
Textures are great, but with 8GB on my video card less pop-in would be appreciated. Also I found a killer whale floating in the air - getting more life in the sea would be much appreciate, right now there're some birds but no fish, dolphins and killer whales etc would be awesome. And the the ability to sail elsewhere, maybe in the arctic? 
Sound is great, love the voice in the tutorial, you really feel like being taught by an experienced supervisor. Touch controls work flawlessly, even kids should be able to steer the boat. 
I do feel that the polygon levels could be improved, maybe by fish in the sea, but maybe even more detailed surroundings (the rope on the boat looks too flat etc.) These are minor complaints, congrats to the devs for the best sailing sims on the Rift - it's an awesome experience!","Feb 4, 2019 at 1:19 AM",5, 16,"Thank you for the review!

Just a comment on ""Arctic"" - we're recently added two DLC maps - ""Arctic"" and ""Lake in Japan"". Hope you will enjoy them!"
2022-05-28 16:52:01.044841,VRoaaar,Very well done!,"It's a realistic sailing experience, well done! Some FPS drops near islands (on my 1080Ti), but it's otherwise very smooth. Odd: I saw some whales above the water and a chest floating mid air.
If you like sailing, I'd highly recommend this. Best played while sitting on the floor.","Feb 10, 2019 at 2:54 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:52:01.059800,Aikidomike79,Awesome,"Very realistic, I'm new to sailing and I think this is a great training tool.","Feb 21, 2019 at 3:21 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:52:04.149537,Kickforce,An amazing experience.,"I love sailing RL, but I rarely have time for it. Getting my boat to the sea and getting it ready to sail takes two hours easily and getting back home with it when I'm done takes two more. That's four hours of work, so I better take a whole day to make it worth it. Plus my boat needs two people to sail so I have to have a friend available to sail with me. While VR regatta isn't the entire sailing experience, it is pretty good and needs a minute to set up, and I'm speeding over the waves. If my family needs me I'm back in a second, and the weather is perfect, year round and day or night.","Sep 22, 2018 at 10:48 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 16:52:04.164496,Kelpius,,"Love the free exploration mode, exactly what I was looking for","Sep 23, 2018 at 2:59 AM",5, 6,
