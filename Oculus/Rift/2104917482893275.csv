First, because there's no indication in the App Store entry that Touch is required: the Supported controllers field is empty. Second, because there doesn't seem to be any reason why this experience should require Touch. It seems to be a completely straightforward building-explorer app, with no manipulation of objects in the environment or the like. Such an experience should work perfectly well with an XBox controller, or the Oculus Remote, or even just a computer keyboard. So hopefully this will be fixed soon.","Feb 6, 2019 at 5:37 AM",1, 6,
