2022-05-28 20:18:59.009275,Neutrino_ghost,Awesome! ....WHY...,"I think it's one of the best 3d modeling  tool out there especially for prototyping game design , creating levels , creating UI.... imports to unity pretty good.. how objects are placed and arranged are easier then other VR modeling apps, they have made this with a sort of intuitive design flow.

PLEASE MAKE MULTIPLAYER!!
Thank you for the awesome app!","Sep 19, 2020 at 1:07 AM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 20:19:02.164945,Clickingtoenails,Amazing! Love it!,"Started creating right away without anything clumsy about this. How do you export the objects though? Okay went to the URL for this and yes you can export. Oooh Goodie! I agree with the other review. Okay I use Medium and Tiltbrush and other tools which I love too, but there is always that one thing they don't do well. You know? Bad export, not enough detail, crappy photo capturing, complex ui, etc. This one I think everyone can get up and running quickly in creating content.","Jul 25, 2020 at 10:52 PM",5, 21,
2022-05-28 20:19:02.179905,javieryunes,Great!! I created what i needed,The learning curve is fast!! The only problem is that it's very unstable and there are many tutorials missing. I'll keep the 5 star rating for a couple of months to give them time to fix stuff.,"Aug 8, 2020 at 5:18 AM",5, 13,
