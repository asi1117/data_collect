Unfortunately there’s no friend group system so we just had to join and have the other person join as quickly as possible to get in the same game and after every game the status shows “OFFLINE” and the only way to fix it is to relaunch the whole game to get it back to “ONLINE”.   Overall I like the concept, it’s a fun game that makes you think with math against competitors but the difficult getting the thing to work and having to keep relaunching it ruins the experience.","May 5, 2019 at 2:01 AM",2, 4,
