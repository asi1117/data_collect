2022-05-28 18:06:07.763976,inceptional,Actually really enjoyed this,"I didn't watch the for ages because the trailer made it look like just another pointless 360 video of some random family, but there's actually a bit more to it than that. I ultimately really liked it--I even started to play the part (you'll get what I mean if you watch it)--and the '80s nostalgia was great. Wish we could see these videos in full HD quality though, but I guess this is what comes of being an early adopter using first-gen VR technology. In the future this kind of stuff is going to be truly awesome.

PS. They could--and really should--do a live-action Robocop version of this, and it would be friking' amazing! Again, you'll get what I mean if you watch it and have seen the original Robocop.","Jul 9, 2018 at 7:59 AM",5, 5,

2 problems,. 1) the Stereoscopic depth is really offlike the cameras were too close together or?  This is more of a Gear VR type experience I think.. 
2) Jeff Goldblum tells you about moving your head up down up down side to side side to side and you go to a paradise but I nearly broke my neck trying to engage it  ???

You can activate and load the start by just keeping your HMD active for the 10 minute load. A great 40+ minute blast to the past in the most original way possible.

2022-05-28 18:06:17.314432,baggyg,Best quality 360 video throwaway story,"Its a 360 video (with some mixed elements - the tv reflection in particular is well done). Its decent enough quality which helps by having downloaded it all first rather than streaming. I got server connection errors at the start. Just dont do anything and they'll go away. This is probably the issue people reported with taking a long time to load. 

The 360 video is prob the best I have seen, but is still strains the eye a lot more than true VR. I like that people are trying different things with the media. In this one the idea of hidden objects are quite cool, and not hidden too far away so you dont feel like you have to ignore the scene. 

My main issue is with the story. Yeah, theres some nostalgic references and toys, but it goes nowhere. No one is likable, and mostly highly annoying. Theres probably some commentary there about the period, but this should always back up a strong story not vice versa.","Aug 8, 2017 at 6:00 AM",2, 2,

I loved the Miyubi Theme and the version with the japanese lyrics at the end - but my biggest question is WHY on EARTH did they hide jeff goldblum and the unicorn scene behind collectible items that are nearly impossible to find? I have to assume that's where that stuff is, because I never saw it. As well, the comedy pretty much entirely missed the mark, the characterization of the grandpa was a little weird and the pacing was a bit slow.

2022-05-28 18:06:29.892789,Elpoc,Not a bad start,"Jeff Goldblum's scenes are hidden behind a hide-and-seek game, the existence of which is only revealed to you at the end of the film. I don't mind, it just means the advertising is very misleading. You have to go back through and find various objects (or maybe just pay more attention the first time round). I'm not going to bother - whilst it's nice to see a more long-form cinematic VR experience, the writing/story was hackneyed and the actors seems severely under-rehearsed. In a VR piece like this, because the audience is right in the middle of things, the acting either has to be seriously (and consistently) naturalistic, or a more classical theatre style. It also has to be extremely consistent, as it's very easy to spot pauses where no-one quite knows what comes next or what's meant to be happening (just like in theatre productions).","Aug 1, 2017 at 9:48 PM",2, 1,
