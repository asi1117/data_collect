The puzzles are a bit awkard and glitchy. It's like watching a low-budget romance movie in 3-D with just enough button-pushing to keep you awake. Definitely not for someone who has gone through a break-up, either. Somewhat preachy and the characters are unlikeable. Great style and feel, just not much else. Price needs to come down on this.",Mar 31 at 6:24 AM,3, 48,
