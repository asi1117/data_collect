2022-05-28 18:30:29.597611,AlexLen,Beautiful and unique game,"A very nice and interesting game that has potential to be even greater. A naration between levels with a nice storyline would be great and some texture to the invironments mabe. 

The gameply is interesting and very nicely integreted in VR. The firs few levels are too easy in comprison to the others but that is all.

Hope for more levels to come ...","Aug 11, 2017 at 7:19 PM",5, 4,
