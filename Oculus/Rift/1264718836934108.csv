2022-05-28 18:23:29.914597,martynasx88,Meh,No need to be in VR. It is just 360 images and poor quality too.,"May 30, 2018 at 5:37 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:23:29.929556,littlegodpan,I want more!,"This is very cool! I'd like to see more. 

A friend and I are working something similar. It would be cool to talk to the developer and learn about their process.","Apr 9, 2018 at 4:19 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:23:29.958479,Quisan,Review is not about the story...,"There are only two SHORT ""chapters"" available as I write this, so I will only comment on the story-telling technology and a brief comment on production values.

For production values, I think the art is fine, but the story telling could be improved with better / more diverse voiceovers. I realize this isn't a Hollywood production, but this is definitely someplace where the experience can be improved.

More importantly, I'd say the technical experience is mostly incredible. Two areas of improvement are: (1) Please improve the navigation instructions. The current graphics don't tell you anything and it's hard to figure out how to go backwards. (2)  It's annoying that the dialog boxes enlarge if they cross your field of vision. Either enlarge them while their dialog is being spoken or, preferrably, don't enlarge them at all. It only distracts/detracts from the experience the way it is now. Otherwise it's a great experience.","Oct 29, 2017 at 2:03 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:23:33.064172,CrimsonCatalyst,I like the idea of comics in 3D,"For some reason, despite wanting to like this. Theres allot in the delivery that just doesnt seem to work. I feel like 3D art and story telling can work. Keep trying!","Oct 15, 2017 at 7:00 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:23:33.079133,Ozimandis,insightful,Thanks for the demo of your new VR comic. I was doing some research about Storytelling and VR and i found your project to be very insightful and i can see where this is going to be a great medium for the future.,"Sep 27, 2017 at 7:50 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:23:33.093095,WKGB_Prewitt,Not the future of comics.,"For all intents and purposes, this is a well put together project with great visuals.  The problem stems from the fact that it make reading a comic TEDIOUS.  While I imagine some people may like the narration/voice acting, I really didn't care for it.  It reminded me of those old Golden Book VHS tapes from the 80's/90's, that took still pictures, and just moved them across the screen while someone read the book.  The future of comics will stay in print and flat digital images, but if it ever ends up in VR, it will become 3D still renders, not 360 photos.","May 8, 2017 at 7:48 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:23:33.107058,ManMythLegend,Interesting,Best use of comics in VR I've seen. Made me a believer!,"Jun 4, 2017 at 5:39 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:23:33.122018,ChrisOakVR,Thank you...,...for this warm and calm told story. Beautiful painted with nice colors. Thank you!,"May 27, 2017 at 5:04 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:23:36.228708,Viper-6,,"Not a bad start. I can't wait to see more content. The first two chapters are good but more dialogue and perhaps more background would be a nice addition. More about the people of the town, more about the civil war, etc...","Mar 14, 2017 at 6:41 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:23:36.242671,jimmytheoniride,Developer here,"First of all thanks for your reviews.
To be fair, this is the very first VR comic.
We are out since 2015 for cardboard, since 1Q of 2016 for Gear and now Rift :)
Also it is fully made in 360, it is not a 2D adaptation!
Thank you for reading it, new chapters are coming!
PS try out the new Spotlight feature with Oculus Touch.","Jan 24, 2017 at 4:44 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 18:23:36.257631,neuro27,Intriguing Comic,"Sorry! Not the first VR comic. That title is taken by ""Since They Left Episode 0"" which came out Nov. 2, 2016.
I enjoyed the story so far. My only criticism would have to be the voice acting. Definitely worth a download for anyone interested, it is free after all!","Jan 13, 2017 at 6:23 AM",4, 9,
