2022-05-28 15:32:44.320297,blueperfluous,,"The 700 MB size offers quick downloads. The controls are super-easy and clearly marked on your VR ""hands."" High-resolution, photo-source rendering of a wide array of the most important planetary bodies ever discoverd in our solar system, along with the Sun and some other stars. Lots of readable facts and photos are offered to deepen one's visual appreciation. Every planetary object can be pulled ""close"" (right or left internal trigger on the remote), rotated (thumb sticks) and  examined with beautiful lightening, darkeining and surface/horizon effects as you turn ""in"" or ""away"" from the virtual Sun (a little bit awkward at times, you may have to twist your hands around in uncomfortable positions to fully utilize the display). Offers 2 ways on the dashboard, gravity assisted flyer and 0g ""space walk,"" to fly around, by and into any display. Playful use of size perspectives with lots of opprtuinity to compare exotic planetary objects and stars with ones closest to Earth (always available on the virtual dahboard). Re-play  offers an all-access amount of ""drop-in"" points.

5 stars as-is, but what could make it 6?

1. Cross-section diagrams of the scientifically-proposed, internal layers for the major planetary objects... interactive? There is text talking about a ""rain of diamonds"" speculated in a layer of Jupiter's atmosphere. How cool would that be imagined in VR?

2. 3D planetary surface renderings, especially those sourced from the small pool of actual robotic lander's data and photos. Venera on Venus, Cassini-Huygens on Titan, a crawl across Mars with Opportunity, Curiostiy, Spirit?","Jun 11, 2020 at 7:49 PM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 15:32:44.364179,supatrupa,I was in awe the whole time,"I did the full tour and examined every bit of info available. I also did the quick tour onr Rift and Quest. This title is just fascinating and awe inspiring. If you are curious about the solar system and our tiny size in the universe, you must check this out. For $10 it is a steal.  I caught myself with my jaw dropped multiple times uttering things like holy f*** and j**** c*****....","Jan 1, 2020 at 6:05 AM",5, 4,Well that sounds like a great way to start 2020. :) Glad you liked it and thank you so much for the review!
2022-05-28 15:32:47.491814,gregc222,Love this experience,"This has always been a fascinating and wonderful way to experience the wonders of our solar system, but the recent updates have improved pretty much every aspect and added a layer of really nice polish. The new tour guide is fantastic, and holding a planet in your hand to take a closer look is just fantastic.

100% recommended if you have even the slightest interest in space!","Dec 1, 2019 at 3:31 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:32:47.506774,FloppyTrout,Sense of scale is fantastic,"Really enjoyed this. Did the full tour and took over an hour, with lots of info and imagery to soak in. If you have any interest in space and our solar system this one is worth picking up. recommended.

Updating this in Oct 2019 - the tour guide content is great. Looking forward to the remaining planets. Still cant beat this for the sense of scale you get when comparing the various bodies. Very enjoyable and well worth the price.","Oct 27, 2019 at 11:40 AM",4, 1,

Make sure you are on v2.5.7b or higher if you've got something like Citrix Workspace running on your PC.

2022-05-28 15:32:47.536694,Kornepheros,Best of the Best!,"Where to start? I will start with the standout feature of this program: ""Flying Professor Alien"" is an absolutely amazing tour guide! The man who voices the character stands out, not only for the scope of the knowledge he presents, but also for his ability to present it clearly, and with passion. This is not an actor reading a script, but an expert sharing his knowledge! I also very much enjoy how ""real"" his lectures are, where we can hear him breathing, and with little ""mistakes"" here and there, instead of typical over-production. I certainly don't mean mistakes about the knowledge, because his knowledge is impeccable, but rather moments where he might stutter, where he loses his train of thought for a few seconds, or (my favorite) when he accidentally invents a new word. To top it off, the tour guide's ability to move around and use hand gestures to point out locations on the planets really works well! All of this made for a much more personal and memorable experience than I ever expected.

The planet textures must also be singled out, not only for their educational and scientific utility, but also for their beauty. Our solar system is gorgeous!

I want to show this experience to everyone I know, so that they can enjoy the solar system as much as I do!

Devs, keep up the fantastic work!","Jul 3, 2019 at 1:49 PM",5, 6,

You get to feel like a god holding the planets in your hand, and the sheer scale of the solar system will impress anyone with a soul.
Simply a must-buy on VR.","Jul 5, 2019 at 12:42 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:32:50.653358,VirtuaLieven,Great app in development,"This is a really great app for friends of astronomy. Some may complain about the non-to scale distance between the planets, but this is also a good thing to compare the planets. There are many functions, lots of settings, you can turn on and off anything you want, it has lots of pictures and useful information. It's not a game though, but it's fun to watch, to fly around and also to learn about our solar system.","Jun 15, 2019 at 2:57 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:32:53.801937,catalysteh,Delivers an experience for a fair price,"If you want to explore the planets in our solar system, this is a very solid way to do so. Guided tour and a few extra bells and whistles to have you revisting this app a few times. Graphics look good, creator did a nice job of scaling things so you have a good experience. Not amazing, but worth the inexpensive price ($7 USD).","May 18, 2018 at 6:12 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:32:53.817895,FastLawyer,"Good space tour, but there's better","This is a nicely made, guided space tour of our solar system. The tour has many interesting, readable facts about our solar system.  The tour really starts to pickup once it reaches past our solar system and into the neighboring nearest stars.  The sheer enormity of it all is breath-taking and leaves you full of wonder.  Unfortunately, the graphics are the weakest part of this game and the reason why I only give it 3 stars.  Spacetours VR - Ep 1 has graphics that are more awe-inspiring than the graphical representations on this tour.  Still, this app is good value for the 50% sale price if you have any interest in an educational space tour.","Sep 30, 2017 at 10:53 PM",3, 6,

I loved this on the GearVR, but I have not been able to launch this in Oculus. I've emailed the support team about a month ago and still have yet to hear back.

Would rate higher if this ever loaded properly.","Oct 7, 2017 at 2:54 PM",1, 0,"Sorry to hear this!  I hadn't heard anything about this until now.  Just confirmed that it's working here, so I'll need to know more in order to solve your problem.

2022-05-28 15:32:53.848811,inceptional,Great little educational experience.,"Really enjoyed going through this.

The only things I'd like to see the developer improve quite a bit is:

A. The ship interior and player model. They look a bit unfinished/unppolished compared to the beautifully realised planets. Get someone else in to redo the model if neccessary, because with that tweak the overall visuals would be spot on. 

B. Re-do the menus. They too look a bit amateur, and while functional they could be much prettier. Even just look at what Oculus is doing with it's Home menu for an nice example of how to put a simple menu interface together.

Other than that, it's all good. :-D","Jun 18, 2017 at 9:10 PM",5, 7,
