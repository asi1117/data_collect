Not only does part of your purchase go to a worthy cause (Saving our oceans before only the virtual ones are left.) but the dives do vary. I spent over twenty minutes on my first session and the sea life will vary a little on each dive. You feel like you are underwater, and it’s nice to have a dive partner with you as you meet and greet the sea life. I would like to see the option to swim the same area freely, but it is still a very pretty dive.","Nov 30, 2018 at 1:15 PM",5, 3,
