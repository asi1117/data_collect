2022-05-28 20:44:33.068707,Awesomeness_1000,Busd Stimulator,This is very good representation of busd. Very accurate and dispicilble. This is what happens when you sleepo on public bus at 3:00 AM. Would recommend. I miss my grand children.,"May 12, 2021 at 6:01 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:44:33.083667,Crayon.Goned.Home316,Awesome,"This is the most beutiful game ive ever played, ending brought a tear to my eye. absolutley stunning","Feb 7, 2021 at 11:17 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:44:33.097629,BalianTheMighty,I hate whoever made this,"Scariest ""game"" I've ever played. I wish I was joking. Most horror games dont scare me. This one on the other hand, was terrifying. I have extremely bad social anxiety and this is basically a horror game that preys on that. It would probably at least mildly unnerve anyone but it's a thousand times worse than you already have social anxiety. Bravo to the devs.","Sep 4, 2020 at 8:05 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 20:44:33.111592,Angelina Starr,Huh.....,I can't decide whether I like this or loathe it.  It's bizarre and unsettling yet artistically interesting enough to watch through to the end.,"Oct 28, 2020 at 11:40 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:44:33.127549,Oldmancrazy,The reviews got me.,"I see free, and I see a 4+ rating I download.  I get what I pay for.  This was interesting.  I can see what the creators were trying to do and it got weird, which I think was the point but it also didn't leave me with anything.  It was a bit longer than I thought it should have been and they could have amped it up imho.

I'm giving it a 1 just because I don't think this thing deserves the total over all rating it currently has.  I'd give it a 3.5 though for being free and an experience.  Not a 4.","Aug 9, 2020 at 8:17 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 20:44:36.245211,Andromeda70,Loved it!,"Basic graphics, but so freaky (in a good way. I started giggling on day three for some reason. My 10 year old daughter was a bit disturbed by it - but she did like some of her fellow travellers. Hey - it's free - what have you got to lose?","Jun 27, 2020 at 7:08 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:44:36.259173,squidylad,Best VR game of 2020,"Wow Truly an amazing experince. Its fun, charming and plain relaxing! For sure the most innovatove VR experience yet! A MUST PLAY!","Jun 8, 2020 at 6:46 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:44:36.274133,Corvo47,I feel I like missed something,"I don't see what everyone is saying about this. 
It's certainly not bad, its competent but I just don't see what everyone else sees in this experience.","Jul 1, 2020 at 11:58 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 20:44:36.289093,codyhasdied,WTF,I got this game thinking this was a game for sleeping BOY WAS I WRONG as soon as I saw the part where the baby was peeking from the driver sweet I almost peed. If you want some scary ness Play now!,"Apr 9, 2020 at 11:37 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 20:44:36.303057,ChrisQuitsReality,Lol that was not what I expected.,"I bought awhile ago and never got around to playing. For got it was an experience not a game, totally caught me off guard. A pretty fun random as experience to show people, I also like some of interations. 

My interpretation of it is showing us how uncofortable it is to be stared at even though we spend so much time staring at others.","Jan 19, 2020 at 1:48 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:44:39.397778,3rd-OrderDerivative,Irrevelant and pointless.,"So why the 5 Stars? Well, because it's weird, that's why. When was the last time you've actually downloaded an irrevelant, pointless and especially weird VR experience for rift? OK, it's not LSD weird, it's more like... imagine a third-grader with a very rudimentary art program for his Caleco video game console. Yes, the one with the cartridge you insert into the top of the machine. Now imagine what kind of ""art"" the kid would produce using said 1980's era gaming machine. Now imagine taking the kid's art and *poof!* Converting all of it into a 3-D experience for the Oculus Rift. Oh, and the kid just happened to create a masterrpiece involving five day's worth of road trips via the metropolitan public transit system.
     If you can imagine all that, then you now have a very good understanding of what to expect with this weird Bus Simulator 'game.'","Nov 23, 2019 at 6:29 PM",5, 22,
2022-05-28 20:44:39.412739,cropsky,What?,"Even thoe I dont know what I just played I enjoyed it a little it was fun and weird at the same time, if you like weird stuff play this!","Jan 9, 2020 at 3:34 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 20:44:39.441661,Dan_Kitty_VR,made me smile,"for those who love random vr experriences...heres another. its short, simple and makes no sense, reminded me of myself","Nov 19, 2019 at 1:42 AM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 20:44:39.456621,pabe05,Very Interesting but...,"Do you remember the '60's?  Probably not. Take a bus ride like you never have before.  This experience is life altering.  Not for children. A naked guy falls for you (I think). Just don't stare.
Get it while you can. Before they make this illegal. Like wow, man.","Nov 23, 2019 at 9:08 AM",4, 2,
