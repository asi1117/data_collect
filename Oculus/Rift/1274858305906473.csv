2022-05-28 19:37:34.579830,marcemira,Waste of time,"Don't waste your time, it's a useless app. You can click the SKIP button, but it will then just display disabled ""image buttons"", a forever ""downloading images""? and there's a + button on top that requires a code (no way to skip that AFAIK)... there are some white text on top that you can barely see because of the white light background, these guys don't know a thing about designing user friendly UI, not accessible at all, just bad. A waste of time.",Oct 4 at 3:21 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:37:34.594790,Blubbblubbblubb,Won't play my 360° photos,"Downloaded to view my 360° photos, but it does not let you. It is asking for a ""magic code"" which I assume is the payed version. You'd think they'd let you look at 1-3 of your own photos in the free version to check out the app. Would not buy before I have not seen my own photos. There are a few samples which are great.","Jul 5, 2020 at 3:33 PM",2, 4,"On the login screen, you can either activate the device, provide the magic code as you said or there is this big third option called ""Skip"" which ""lets you in"" without any need to pay for anything and you can try not only featured tours from our customers but also use Shared Experience.
Didn't you notice this SKIP button?"
2022-05-28 19:37:34.610748,Gustav_von_Helmet,Not A 360 Photo Viewer,"This sounded to me like a viewer for your 360 photos. It isn't - all you seem to be able to view with the free part of this app is view some examples, and even they either took ages to load or didn't work - I didn't wait long enough to find out which.","Dec 10, 2019 at 6:56 PM",1, 3,"no idea why you are saying that it’s not a 360 photos viewer when we support renderings and 360 photos :)
regarding loading time - you do know that 360 photos or renderings are quite heavy and a VR tour sometimes can be something like 300mb so it takes a bit time to download it 

I hope you have a good day :) 
Cheers

2022-05-28 19:37:34.625708,Dunksrocks,Fabulous 360 Tour Viewer,"This is NOT just a 360 degree (sepherical) photo viewer, don't get confused!

This is an app that allows you to take 360 degree photos using a 360 degree camera (I use an Insta360 One X to take the pics then converted each of them to JPEG's) and upload them and create warp points to help you (or your client) move around.

You can also upload a floor plan and create thumbnails for each picture which are set off inside a great cave like menu systems that seems quite funky.

Great work on this app.

Some really good tools have been developed to share the tours you create including Magic Code - simply copy the code unique for your tour and share with your client.  They enter the code to view your code.

Additional tools include the ability to add ambient sound and pictures/videos.  The navigation systems also allows you to tour without the need for a system controller.

Great work, great app.  Well done and thank you...","Mar 7, 2019 at 11:25 PM",5, 5,Wow! thank you so much :) we couldn't do a better description of theViewer ourselves :) huge thanks!
2022-05-28 19:37:37.757924,neuro27,Basic Spherical Photos with Navigation,"There are 9 sets of spherical photos for you to explore. Most are real estate properties, but one is of the London Bridge. The photos are high quality, but the UI is very basic. Just look and click (or wait) to go on to the next one. There is no menu within a set to pick where you want to go. Also, the orientation can be confusing sometimes. For example, on the London Bridge, I was looking one direction to go South, but then after teleporting, I was looking the same direction, but it was now facing North. Otherwise, neat free app, but there are other better versions of this type. I recommend ""Transported"" as the best real estate app on the Oculus store right now.","Nov 1, 2017 at 7:24 AM",3, 3,"Hi There! thanks for the feedback!
The thing is that this is not a standalone app...
The set of photos are only examples and this app is a part of our platform called theViewer.co
Menu is simple because it's actually intended to be simple :) 
On theViewer.co every user can create his own VR Tours and then when you start the app you don't see the sample projects but only your content
