Not to say that I don't like this game, far from it, it's a very unique take on a puzzle/action platformer, but the execution here has left a lot to be desired in the comfort category. They chose a stationary god-mode camera for a game all about time-sensitive fighting and extreme height platforming, and that causes some issues. The levels often stretch far outside the field of view of the player, and unlike in games like Kronos or Moss, where the levels are designed at a scale that makes it easy to see details and focus on enemies in the near field, this game scales the world to be so small that even the player character is the size of basically an ant. This works for the art style, which is rather low poly and blockish, but doesn't work for the gameplay, which requires you to be as close to the player character at all times to be able to accurately time your moves.

The issue this causes is that a game that, if played on a flat screen, would have a scrolling camera becomes a game where you have to be the scrolling camera. Not a good thing for a game that's a platformer, the game genre known for letting the player rest their head while playing. Instead, this game expects you to be moving with the player character, despite the miniscule size. I honestly think an alternate camera mode where you were zoomed much farther in and the camera was instead a drone that followed the player close behind at almost the same scale would have made for a more comfortable experience. (Think how Adventure Time VR did their camera, a floating balloon camera that followed behind the player characters) Sure, KIN would have to impliment a snap turning system instead of a single joystick movement scheme, but as it stands this game doesn't use the right joystick at all, and I think it could be utilized quite well.

That said, I think this is quite the solid game, strictly gameplay wise. I hope it receives more love in the future, it deserves it.","Aug 9, 2020 at 5:52 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:10:11.732641,SpaceByte,Not as seemed to be,"When you normally see a 3rd person view on a game trailer, you expect it to be first person, and that was just cinematic footage, no where does it say in the description it's third person, vr is meant to replicate reality with things you can't normally do, so it should at least have an OPTION to switch to first person, I didn't immediately refund this because I didn't want to seem like I was just refunding all my games, I HEAVILY regret that, I really wish I had my money back in order to buy another game that I really do want, and know is good, waste of your money, don't buy it, I wish I could just go back in time & stop myself from buying it","Aug 2, 2020 at 12:16 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 17:10:11.748598,Skyppai,Masterfully designed platformer,"A nice oldschool puzzle platformer with modern sensibilities, featuring a very elegant design, both in terms of appearance as well as in gameplay. This elegance also shows in how nuanced the difficulty is. Falling into pits can be very frustrating but here it doesn't deplete your lives and might even work to your advantage. 

The challenge provided by the enemies is neither too easy nor too hard (referring to the default difficulty setting), but the system is unforgiving so you will have to repeat battles until you can execute your strategies flawlessly. You don't always have to defeat all enemies to progress so sneaking past them is sometimes the better option.

The two weapons you obtain differ in range and effect, the latter being color coded in the same way as as the enemy attacks. Controls are simple and on point. The tutorial companion bot is unintrusive and keeps giving you hints and cues for new techniques at a good pace. It also shows your health, weapon charge and live count. Your weapons are also tools for solving puzzles, which are clever and varied, giving you a good sense of accomplishment, as do the battles. Boss fights are real road blocks and as deep as the full levels. 

If you like traditional 3rd person games, this game is highly recommended. It does a great job bringing this type of game into VR.","Dec 29, 2018 at 7:14 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 17:10:11.763558,SparkyNinja1583,Very charming,"I enjoyed this a lot. It's short. I'd say about 2-3 hours. Try on hardest difficulty it will give you a run for your money that's for sure. Kinda reminds me of hyper light drifter a little bit. Not exactly but it gave me the same vibe.

Not sure if 10 bucks is fully worth it for all people. I got it on sale. Definitely worth the sale price. More like this please :) Nice job, devs!","Jul 10, 2018 at 8:46 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 17:10:14.900169,JadeKVR,JadeKVR Review,"(Gameplay on the JadeKVR channel) 
KIN is a VR puzzle platformer adventure game. The gameplay sees you awaken and you travel through portals on an alien planet, engaging in combat as you encounter alien enemies along your journey. The controls and gameplay are very intuitive, and reflective of typical platformer, and so the game aligns perfectly with the Oculus Rift Touch controllers. The game has a unique abstract style, the scenery is bright, colourful and beautiful, with plenty of personality, and this is by far the prettiest platformer I have ever played. The character that you play, is a likeable tiny girl, with striking big white hair, and the combat element of the game sees her wielding a futuristic red sabre as her primary weapon. There is an air of mystery surrounding your character, you travel through different levels defined by new environments, and encounter more enemies alongside some puzzles. The game can be played on three difficulty modes, and there are different maps that you can play, making this game good value for money. This is a great platformer, and I think that Virtual Reality enhances the gameplay because of it's unique design.","Feb 17, 2018 at 6:01 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 17:10:14.915129,FranksNPhoebs,Amazing!!,"What an amazing game.. so creative.. so simple... kudos to the developers on this one.  For a 45+ yr old who grew up with Atari 2600/Colecovision/etc, this just blows me away... so much to look forward to - hope to be gaming as a Grandpa someday!   :)    Definitely a must buy in my opinion!!","Mar 14, 2018 at 11:14 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:10:14.930089,Inso80,Great,"This Jump n Run is just great - artstyle, graphics, gameplay. And It´s definitely challenging. Every ""level"" has a handful of fights / puzzles. You have four lives, after that the level resets. The playstyle reminds me of Darksiders - think about right tactics, attack, dodge..  Enjoyed every minute.","Mar 14, 2018 at 8:20 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:10:14.945049,SavoryApricot,Worth getting,"Great gameplay, awesome visuals and music. Its challenging enough to be fun, and the puzles are simple but require some thinking the father you get. Id rate 5 stars if it werent for the ability to get your health back by jumping off a ledge. Instead of spending a life to get your health back, you can walk off a ledge and respawn at the start with full health, which makes the combat really easy since every level seems to have ledges everywhere. That paired with the charged boomarang sorta ruined the difficulty for me. The first few stages where you couldnt do that were a lot more challenging, I wish that stayed for the rest of the game. Still fun though.","Feb 19, 2018 at 7:35 AM",4, 7,"Hi Maxus, 
Maybe you could try to play the game on 'Fighter' mode, the hardest difficulty setting? It sounds like this would really suit you; it punishes you from falling/jumping of ledges for example. 
Pleased to hear that you enjoyed our game overall :)"
2022-05-28 17:10:14.960009,RealityCheckVR,✓ More than just a PRETTY PUZZLE GAME!,"So far I have spent just about 1 1/2 hours in the game and I'm enjoying it very much! The first few levels go by quickly as you learn to control your character and navigate through the world. Soon enough the levels begin to take more effort and you actually have to begin putting in some effort.
The visuals are gorgeous and the music is nice and relaxing. It is very easy to get lost in the worlds that the developers have created and the story within the game is very subtle and beautiful to witness.)) Looking forward to finishing the game!

This is the most aesthetically pleasing game I have ever played in VR! This game was made by the same developers who created SURGE and you can tell they were able to maintain their artistic style from the sound effects to the ambient music (which is awesome btw). I've only just started the game but it's already in my top 10! This game is a great buy that you won't regret.","Feb 6, 2018 at 12:40 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 17:10:21.234227,brent7890,Most fun I've had gaming for awhile now,"I'm not dead-set on any kind of game. I like board games to FPS to RTS to indie games and even console games. Never been that fantastically skilled at a lot of games. I just got into VR, and I've never played a game like this before. This game is beautifully made, IMO. The artistic visuals and sounds in this game are very enjoyable. The VR experience added to this game really makes a tremendous difference -- you can feel this game on a whole 'nother level. Not a whole lot of story to this game so far, only an hour in, but there is some... maybe enough? 

Each level gets progressively harder, the objective is to advance to the next level by doing puzzles, combatting enemies, not falling and dying. Like Mario on Nintendo, really. Throughout the game, you teleport to new mini-virtual worlds by completing the current one, these worlds that you can literally walk around in while moving your little character. This game has some serious atmosphere that really gets you involved with it. I just love this kind of VR experience so far. This game is simple, yet challenging enough to keep me interested so far.

Anyway, from a person just getting into VR, who's not only interested in FPS and online gaming; get this game. You will so not be disappointed. Fun for the kids, fun for the family, fun for anyone really -- but not meant for more than one person playing at once, maybe a few watching and taking turns. It's worth the price, seriously! Really fun!","Feb 12, 2018 at 7:23 AM",5, 6,

Screenshots do not do this game justice, in VR it is superb. The sense of scale, depth and scope is brilliant. This type of genre in VR is rare and it's a shame because this gives you a whole new level of atmosphere and fun. Controls are slick, the levels are well thought out and challenging and the characters and enemies are unique. Stumbling across the 1st boss and I was in awe at its attack moves and patterns. It was clear to see this had been well thought out and crafted. 
VR is the next level/stage for all games and its nice to see platformers stepping up to the mark.","Feb 4, 2018 at 5:14 AM",4, 4,
