2022-05-28 12:58:20.801625,Pik_c,"Good game, but Online Co-op is broken","DO not buy unless you only want to play solo.
This game is absolutely awesone, unfortunately the CO-op mode is unplayable it will just lag when you have too many unit and you will never be able to finish a game with a friend. Also it seems the devs have abandonned the game and won't update it anymore so it won't get fixed.",Mar 2 at 11:51 PM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 12:58:20.818580,VanillaBird,Buy on sale,"TL:DR: There's very little strategy involved, the game artifically extends rounds to be upwards of an hour long, the AI are immune to attrition, and there's very little content to actually play.


AI don't play fair to force what should easily be 20-30 minute fights into being 45-60 minutes. It's neat for sure, but it's far from a game of strategy. Every opponent talks a lot of trash constantly. The constant voicelines can get annoying, especially when you get notified by your architect that enemies are attacking you every 3 seconds they're in your territory. Some units have no counters as well.

As far as competitive strategy games that need you to think or really strategize go, this is bottom of the barrel. There's no room for strategizing against an opponent who is immune to attrition, doesn't have to follow the same rules as you, and tends to start the map with more than enough armies to instantly defeat you should it bother to do so. The game certainly looks neat, sounds neat (except when someone is talking), and runs smoothly. Game file is extremely large for how little is actually in-game and the price is going to make it a hard sell if you don't get it on sale.

All in all, it's a fun game to waste time on, but the full $30 game is far from worthwhile, especially if you're looking for a meaty strategy game to sink your teeth into. There isn't really a high skill ceiling and the game doesn't hesitate to call everything you do stupid for upwards of an hour. Literally. As in your opponent will make remarks every few minutes about how stupid or useless you are.",Jan 6 at 2:18 PM,3, 23,
2022-05-28 12:58:20.833540,POndrej,Very good,"It is really nice game, however I would like to have there lets say more nations so the units on both sides would not be the same all the time, also possibility to destroy/replace you building to have possibility to change which units are produced at specific location. And perhaps group logic: you would create groups and then you would be able to quickly select them",Dec 8 at 8:01 PM,4, 6,

Matchmaking takes FOREVER sometimes and there is nothing to do while you wait. The practice arena while waiting for matches gets old after the first 3 waves much less after 50+ .

(TRY BRASS TATICS ARENA ITS THE DEMO THERES LESS STUFF TO DO BUT IT LETS YOU GET THE IDEA OF BTA.)

more upgrade slots for the castle also could you make a horde game mode thats co/op and solo so you start off with an easy horde and then they keep on getting harder each round and you have to defend your base for an amount of time or you have to kill all the units that are coming and alsomake it be infinite rounds or a certan amount of rounds or both.   please add this devs and if you do this than tysm!
also please add it for then you can be a unit if you want to hit then  you have to press
a or x for units without power ups and b or y for unites with powerups. Can you 
 add a mage unit so its power is it can stun people and while their stunned they lose health.   and could you also add a unit thats called the ressurector it can ressurecote the dead enemies and make  them go on his/her team so lets say i was blue and someone was red i had the ressurector and killed someone on red i used his/her power and i ressurected them and made them on blue. Also when they get ressurected make them be a quarter of the color they were before so if i was on white and someone was on green if i ressurected them and made them on white then they would stil have a patch of green on them but be mostly white.

Also love the main characters, especially that lady with the deep/scratchy voice. The controls are very intuitive, with lots of fighter types and lots of styles to play it.

2022-05-28 12:58:39.797025,Glitch Fandango,One of my favourite VR titles,"I love this game! It’s such a refreshing change of pace from the seemingly endless shooters available in VR. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good shooter, but VR is capable of delivering so much more and Brass Tactics really shows that.

The fantasy/steampunk aesthetic is amazing, the gameplay is intuitive and the whole thing is just really polished. A thoroughly well thought out and well delivered game, that is above everything else, great fun to play.

It’s possibly a bit more of an “action/arcade RTS” than an in depth strategy game, but that’s probably another reason why I like it so much. Easy to get into for a quick 30-40 minutes and then off to do other things. Just brilliant.

I do think that they missed a trick by not including more unit types, or factions that had specific units and tactics. There are also a few additional controls that I would have liked to see as well, but these are tiny points that don’t make me like the game any less. 

This game is great, and even better is the fact that you can play the free version, Brass Tactics: Arena if you’re not convinced!","Jan 23, 2020 at 5:11 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 12:58:39.812982,Knockem,Good Start but I want more!,"I like where this is headed in terms of strategy board type games.  A four star for me is as good as a 5 star.  Reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I think their is a lot of room for growth.  The game play was good but started to lack slightly after I learned the rules and that if you have enough titans and attack a certain way.  Your almost always guaranteed a win from the computer.  I passed all the levels.  If you dont have friends taht have this game you cant play with anyone.  I think having public rooms would be nice.  

 I'd like to be able to rotate the table but you cant.  Also I think to truly get that 3D game play.  You need to be able to add tunnels or be able to dig tunnels the other player cant see unless they send scouts or dig their own to try to cross the path.  You have air and land attacks but nothing underground.  I think you could have expanded on upgrade ability of the castles.  This might sound a little like another game and it kind of is at the idea point.  If you could add a little more user control in terms of like gathering lumber and rocks and be able to build walls and towers instead of fixed location would be awesome.  

Idk if you can buy licenses from other game builds to use some fo their engines but if I could build the perfect game like this.  It would be the three.

Only they streamlined it to only be the fun bits... And added catapults you can use with your VR hands to manually lob fireballs at enemy units!  Every game is 15 - 20 mins.  The AI can be really hard but there is a nice slider to control the difficulty. You also have 3 unique AI personalaties to play against. Each has their own unique banter, which I thought was great.  They have weekly challenges which are really uniqie and fun.  They are like free DLC, every week!  The one just this week was amazing. There was a huge twist at the end and I almost lost.  Really nice addition, still in 2019, way after release.  The only thing that I think they are missing is automatic battle formation, like in Age of Empires. In that game you could just drag your mouse and the various units formed up in the 'right way'. e.g. Archers in the center of a warrior box for protection.  Here, you must form the squads manually, and they can break apart if you're not watching them carefully.  It is hard to fight on two fronts at the same time.  You also can't build walls like in AOE, though there is a wall mechanic in some maps.  They also dropped micro managing your villagers.  I am happy to not have to manage the pions anymore. That was a welcome move.  All in all 5 stars.","May 5, 2019 at 10:35 AM",5, 12,

Now there is a decent amounts of units and upgrades so the gameplay is about timing and army composition. It's an accessible game so there are always people online and it takes some knowledge to be good at it. The campaign is a boring for the first 3-4 levels and it's 8 levels short campaign and it feels like you are forced you to appreciate the tutorial instead of playing a story but the mutliplayer is well done. Brass Tactics is fun game now for me who played his first RTS decades ago this is not an interesting game.","Apr 10, 2019 at 8:47 PM",3, 0,

The idea of really moving around a 3D map and planning out battles is just a fun game mechanic.  I really hope there becomes a larger story to this with some more levels, some kind of expansion.

2022-05-28 12:59:01.895212,sephethus,I had no idea,"I had no idea this was what this game was. I've been seeing in the store for months but never realized it was this incredible, well polished RTS game. VR takes this genre to a whole new level, making it not only really cool in terms of graphics and extending one's ability to keep track of what's going on but really fun too, meaning this game sucks away more time than the SIMS and Civilization, but I'm ok with that.  I have no complaints about the game but I do have some feedback.

1. The campaign is too short and the story is thin, would really like a lot more depth and length. I beat the campaign in a single weekend.
2. The upgrade path is kind of one dimensional compared to many RTS games like AoE and Starcraft, it'd be great to see more strategic ways to upgrade units besides just plopping down buildings from a drawer.
3. Someone in the reviews mentioned building more castles. I'd love to see that kind of thing in the future, more buildings besides towers.
4. The multiplayer is subject to the very same issues that classic RTS games had, some are even saying that there's cheats and hacks. Most people will just watch and see what others produce and then produce the counter and immediately ""grunt rush"". This makes for boring times.
5. Classic RTS games like Warcraft, Starcraft, Age of Empires and others had worker units that were not auto generated. There was also more balance between units making some favorable against others. That is somewhat the case here but the fact that you can basically win the campaign with tanks alone is somewhat of an issue here. These older games had the same issue, however, where ""zerging"" was the end result.","Jan 7, 2019 at 6:31 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 12:59:05.045412,Narwhaleducky,Bad RTS,"This game looks good, but thats it. It's shallow gameplay and you'r better off buying 2 large pizzas than this. The campaign doesn't even last a solid 2-3 hours, all there is unit spam and hard counters. You can litterly win a game by spamming ONE baisic unit and rush the enemy castle at the 5-7min mark. From my understanding the only good advanced unit is the Mechanic wich is the healer. Everything else is countered by one basic unit. The ""economy"" you have is nonexistant only getting four gems at the start and barely any gold. The Co-Op mode isn't even 2v2, but a rigged version of the first campaign mission but with two people and a bigger map. The so called ""counters"" to the units are borderline non existant. Archers dont do anything to ground units, but still claiming they're strong agaisnt ground units. Thats the same thing with other units like cavalry vs archers. It claims that Cavalry units are strong agasint Archer units, but they do nothing to them and are easily picked off with wariors. I don't know if the game is in a Beta or better an Alpha but it looks that way. The developers need to start balancing out ALL units and adding more. In addition they should start including the tips in loading screens to the tutorial and not them being hidden hints. Also theres a problem if your game needs a website to explain how the game works. Drop the price tag please, this isn't worth 30dollars when you allready have a free version of the game.","Dec 27, 2018 at 2:22 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 12:59:05.061370,Imnuktam,Must have for VR,"The game pieces and board look fantastic. This is definitely a must have. Few things I would love to see added. 

1. Want to be able to give commands and move around board while paused in single player. I enjoy rts games but i dont want my game to be me just spam building units to a location, I want to watch and engage in the little battles.    

2. Speed setting for game / resources. 

3. A leader unit, give maybe 4-8 or so unique choices to pick from. Make them fairly strong and hard to kill, and take a good amount of time say 3 min to respawn if they are killed. 

4. Let the catapult be something you can buy like a unit choice and make it do more damage but take longer to fire. Thus it would be available for each map, and be effective when you land a shot but miss often since you cant spam shots til you zero in on them.  

5. Enable record and playback of matches. I learn a lot from and really enjoying watching replays of battles.

6. A free for all or 2v2 3v3 etc modes of gameplay.","Jan 15, 2019 at 11:33 AM",5, 4,

An RTS revolves around control over units, this game has terrible controls. Every unit you want to move must be manually selected individually. How can you possibly keep tanks in front and archers in back if you cannot auto select units by type?  And selecting an individual unit requires a half press of the trigger which leads to many errors in the heat of battle. There is no ability to set rally points either. Grouping units into formations is painful and time consuming. If you cannot control your own troops strategies cannot be implemented. Very simple improvements can improve this game greatly. I will update review if need be.","Mar 31, 2018 at 7:35 AM",3, 23,"Our update on 4/4/18 added Tower Rally points!
We did an update recently that included a way to choose one type of unit to move. Hold the stick to either side when selecting units with the trigger, and it will lock your selection to the first unit you select (or the unit types you already have selected). Just hold the stick, select a warrior, and paint over all your units and only warriors will be added to your selection. Detailed release notes can be found on the Brass Tactics subreddit as well."

If you have even the remotest interest in RTS games (and you have VR (duh?) then I think this game is a must buy. I'm still on the campaign mode and solo (Skirmish) mode but there is Multiplayer as well. 

I'll eventually get into the Multi but I'll finish the campaign first. It's how we learn ... The maps all look amazing, the 6th or 7th Ice map (from the campaign) in particular is stunning. The AI is actually really good in Solo play, they are a good challenge for me. That may change as I get better at the game. **And** you also get 'Little Finger' (from GoT) insulting you for good measure, so good!! It makes you just want to kill all his Units SO BAD!! ;-)

Only eight maps are a little lean but hopefully the Developer will add a few more but what there is, is still a lot of fun. I can't really be more positive about this game so, it's time for a negative...... One really bad point is that I can't seem to set rally points! I'd love it if I could set a 'rally point' from my towers?? Maybe we can, but the Tutorials didn't mention it and I haven't found a way. ***EDIT*** And now we can. Thanks Devs!!

Another 'race' added to the game would be great but, maybe that will come in some DLC. I'd be happy to pay for that!! And I HATE DLC!

Also the abilty to select all units of a particular type in an areas possbile by holding both trigger buttons while hovering over the unit for example. Without these basic things it seems really light on the strategy aspects and there's a lot fo unnecessary moving around the mapp to gather units built at towers.

Gameplay centers around spawning units to gain more regions to increase production and expand your army to eventually take down the opponents castle.

That being said, I have a fairly good grasp of the units and what mode of strategy is called for in each map.  This is a node-based RTS, so you will be building your buildings at, and focusing your attacks on, specific places on the map.  This leads to more linear RTS gameplay, but in a very good way.  Maps are built with chokepoints in mind, specific types of mines direct your attention to different parts of the map depending on your plan, and although there aren't a staggering amount of unit types, the ones there are remain aesthetically and mechanically distinct so that you can spend your time playing intelligently, as opposed to trying to figure out what units are being built from across the level.

The first one seems to be too easy, to the point where it is boring, and the latter is so hard, it was the challenge I've never witnessed in an RTS game. Eventually I won, but I failed so many times... Also, there are only 3 types of opponents. Which is not that bad, considering they all act differently as an AI to deal with, and you have both PvP and PvE multiplayer. There is moderate amount of units, but only 2 elite units (If you count upgrades, which also change their appearance, this amount almost tripples), but I still hope they will make more of them, because for elites, currently we have only oversized (but so epic) soldier, and Red Alert-like Airship. As these are meant to be OP but expensive, devs can go wild with these, I hope amount of units will increase with future updates.
But these are just nit-picking, overall it is truly great game, and it is an example, a beacon to all other game developers, to how the game should be polished.","Feb 23, 2018 at 7:18 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 13:00:05.114817,AthleteOWar,Wow!,"This is hands down the best, most complete VR game I have played. This is a true AAA title. It is a really cool concept pulled off masterfully. Beautiful game, excellent gameplay, good community. Each tabletop you play on is unique and beutifully crafted. A lot of attention to detail. The figures are great, and it is awesome watching them traverse the table. This truly sets the standard for games to come. Amazing!","Feb 24, 2018 at 8:06 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 13:00:08.219662,Dranu,Great starter for VR RTS,"The game seems well polished and the controls are (suprisingly) very intuitive and easy to use.  It plays a bit like Starcraft style RTSs, with somewhat less micromanaging and basebuilding, along with a sort of Company of Heroes/Dawn of War resource system.  I highly recommend it.

The only downsides I would say is it is a bit simplistic (especially versus AI) and could use a few more units/upgrades/abilities, but this is coming from someone who is a huge Company of heroes fan (often criticized for being too complicated).  People more interested in the Age of Empires or Starcraft versions of RTS should find no problem with that.  Also future updates might alleiviate this.","Feb 23, 2018 at 10:03 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 13:00:11.376397,makah21,Can't hear anyone. Sooooo.,Game is still rock solid by any game standard and above and beyond 99 percent of Vr games. Truly a great RTS and also just a fun game even if you have never played an real time strategy. The controls are simplistic and smart. Game play is endless and fun. Singleplayer action is equally as replayable as multiplayer.  Very enjoyable table tops to get lost in. Also little finger is a great foe to destroy.,"Feb 26, 2018 at 1:09 PM",5, 1,

I got frustrated at first, but once you get a handle on the units and how you want to play it gets easier. 

Really need to add a restart button for single player, really hard to keep playing a game that eats up so much time. Trying to develop a stratagy/play around have fun and you need to listen to people talk before getting back to the main menu to do it again.

I get it, I concided, I suck, shut up and set the board again.","Feb 26, 2018 at 10:26 AM",4, 4,
