""This experience allows you to take off as a bird with wings, fly around the lake...""

Does NOT allow you to freely move arround, it is just a bunch of 360 degree images (at a good resolution, I'll give them that) with an awkard movement system between them that requires getting back to a fixed point to switch to a diferent photo. Advertised Oculus Touch support is limited to the A button that brings you to the home point. 

I wish Oculus would check out the apps before putting false advertisments in their store. It's not an expensive app, but cheaters don't deserve financing!","Dec 23, 2020 at 9:39 PM",1, 3,

Excellent Project.

Any plans to extend it?


I would suggest, a few little interface options.

1).  Menu Button - options, settings, and end/exit
2).  Possible to add a Location map?
3).  Seperate Volume levels for
      a). Voice,
      b). Music,
      c). Ambient.
4).  Perhaps some video tweeking options.

Very well done!

I do not hesitate to recommend this!","Dec 12, 2019 at 11:09 PM",5, 8,

Wish I could use the touch controllers to free fly and other options.  I also think there should be an indicator for places you have visited.","Apr 15, 2019 at 5:47 AM",3, 1,
