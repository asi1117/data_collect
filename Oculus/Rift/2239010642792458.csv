2022-05-28 12:34:07.017946,ubelsteiner,One of my fav games,"But not getting the updates we deserve.  Steam version is more updated than Oculus.

I will forgive the nearly 2 year hiatus and give 5 stars when the updates resume and this game is put together in a coherent, non-buggy order, and we at least get the same content as Steam purchasers.",Feb 14 at 1:24 AM,1, 32,
2022-05-28 12:34:07.035898,RugRatv1TTV,Great game BUT...,"Great game but can tend to get boring. Not a HUGE map selection and multiplayer is a little scruffed, but it really is a good game just needs a bit more content.",Mar 14 at 2:15 PM,4, 25,
2022-05-28 12:34:07.050858,Creeperjellybean,Another delayed update,"Hello, I really do enjoy this game. However, why is it that steam currently has an update for two more maps while we don't? Is this intentional? Thank you.",Mar 17 at 8:55 AM,5, 15,
2022-05-28 12:34:07.065818,CaptnNoBeardOHare,Rift S PCVR version abandoned by devs.,"I've had this game for a couple of years now and initially it was a lot of fun.

However there's not been an update for the Oculus version for quite some time now whilst the SteamVR version is still getting the odd update here and there (last December there were 2 new maps added to the SteamVR version, Night Shift pt2 and Waterbase, but you won't be getting those here!).

That means if you want the latest up to date version, you'll have to double-dip and buy the SteamVR version and run it through there. The Rift S version is dead. Rather than simply bringing the version sold on this store up to the same version as the SteamVR version, the devs seem to be content to ignore all of those original Oculus customers who bought and supported this game in the first instance.

This is appaling behaviour by the devs and as far as I'm concerned I'm done with them and their games. Have a quick google search for ""Zero Caliber Abandoned"" and you'll see a few posts discussing just that.

I'll be happily taking my money elsewere.",Feb 3 at 1:54 AM,1, 18,
2022-05-28 12:34:07.080778,ShardFish,Why do i need to buy this game twice?,I went to their website and it says that they are not updating zero caliber because they're making zero caliber reloaded. So if i want to get the newest and complete stuff like melee and a story I have to buy the new version?,Jan 8 at 2:18 AM,3, 62,
