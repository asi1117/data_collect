2022-05-28 13:34:52.271458,Shnable13,litterally unplayable,"1. The table was way too low
2. Everytime i picked up a card it fell through the table
3. The game stutters a lot even on very good hardware","Dec 6, 2020 at 12:20 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 13:34:52.289409,asimura,Single Player is boring,"I am confused by other reviews. All I get is a boring office to play in. Picking the cards up is a good mechanic but perhaps too real so also a bit boring. I prefer Power VR by Tripp which is in a ghostly period house, has several different games to play and is fun. It uses a controller to move the cards but it works well. I'll probably uninstall this one.","Sep 10, 2019 at 5:46 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 13:34:52.305367,VibrationsOfDoom,*UPDATE* PLEASE port over to Quest 2!!,"November 2021 update...

Bought me a Quest 2... Developers, PLEASE make this port over to the Quest 2!! I Still play it quite a bit, still fun... It seems like all the bugs I mentioned a year or so ago have been fixed... Well, except there still doesn't seem to be any human players in the multi play room... That's okay though. Do love the new scenes, still more could be added (in a forest, pirate ship, great pyramid, international space station, how about inside a TARDIS? In the council room at Gallifrey? On board a Death Star?)

Great solitaire game... I dare say this is a no brainer for the Quest 2, would LOVE to be able to install it to the Quest 2 headset... Shouldn't have to lug around a PC or laptop to play these when I'm out of town and space to carry massive amounts of stuff is at a premium...",Nov 28 at 3:49 PM,4, 9,

2022-05-28 13:34:55.481480,RotparJesus,Spoilers!!,"The best part of this game is finding out there is a cat video playing on the tablet in the main lobby. 

The only things I wanted different were the way the cards lay on the table, if I set a card somewhere randomly it stays there for a few seconds then returns to the spot you picked up the card, I would say either have the card instantly return or let it remain there forever.

I like having to pick things up that you drop in VR, and watching my friends try to pick up things they drop even more. So being able to drop cards off of the table would be a big step forward in my oppinion. Of course that's just my take on it.","Mar 1, 2019 at 1:14 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 13:34:58.614193,jdscheer99,This used to be a Good game,"Just like anyother game sold out to advertisements, and now I am seeing them WAY too much, and also with the last fix I am forced to play a 3 card game when I ask for a singel card turn over,  and I am also each game having to turn off the annoying music.","Dec 15, 2018 at 12:57 AM",1, 1,"Thank you for your review. I'm preparing an update to fix the issues you mention. I'm not sure what you mean by ""sold out to advertisements"", the game is free to play so how can we cover our expenses? I offer a paid premium upgrade that lets you turn off the ads. Best of both worlds, i think. Thanks for playing!"

2022-05-28 13:35:01.781300,Kryssy723,Great fun!,"I love playing this. Me and my husband could spend hours playing this. I wish, however, that the power solitare had the option to enable/disable the bot.  I would like to be able to sit back and enjoy the game instead of rushing because of the bot. The bot thinks very fast. Its unrealistic.  They should think about implementing the option to turn him off for people who are looking to just chill and play.","May 27, 2018 at 12:33 AM",4, 7,

I felt continuously sick playing this due to the frame rate bouncing randomly between 40 and 80fps.  This on the same computer that plays elite just fine.

How do you mess up solitare so badly?","Feb 20, 2018 at 1:22 AM",1, 2,"Hello. I'm one of the developers and would like to determine what is going on. The app has been out for many months and we get very few negative comments about the frame rate. I'd like to know more about your system specs, please email me directly. Also, fyi, there's an easter egg, if you point the controller at your face and pull the trigger, that enables a frames-per-second heads up display we used during development! If we could improve your experience with the game (and rating) that would make my day! Cheers,
