2022-05-28 19:33:55.445107,PsyberBill,Simply fun,"This is a simple simulator that anyone can just get in the seat and go into being a fighter pilot in WWII. i like how simple it is. i am looking forward to the graphics improving. regardless, it is simply fun. yeah its buggy, For example in the beginning turning is easy and then there is almost no turning ability.","Aug 28, 2020 at 7:37 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 19:33:55.461064,SMCI,Great Game,"Sometimes I get locked out with a notice that I could not be connected to the arena or that a firewall could be blocking the server.
I have no firewall that is blocking the server and I have allowed Oculus to download for this app.
I have not been able to play the game for over a month and don't know what to do.   I only have a problem with this game.  All other games of this nature work well on the Oculus.","Dec 13, 2020 at 4:50 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 19:33:55.508936,Atoner,Buggy (for me) but good fun.,"Tried this out, flouting the rules and advice immediately by trying it with a 2 sensor forward facing set up (I was intrigued) and I've go to say I enjoyed what I played.
My tracking went whacko a few times - which was annoying - and some of the overlay graphics didn't seem to sit quite right in my view - but have to bear in mind that I was skimping on the tracking and haven't yet delved into the many fine tuning options available.  I felt this experience deserved a fairer review, and I'm curious to see how far this app gets because it has got most of it right: this early release has tons of options and swathes of potential.  The dog-fighting can be intense, the flight controls are intuitive and easy to identify, and as a bonus this is one of the few games that gave me a good old stomach lurch like I haven't felt in rift for a couple of months now.  Oh, and Touch control - perfect choice of control for people like me - too lazy to plug in a controller.
Maybe add some contextual advice for newbs?  I freaked when I couldn't outrun that looming red wall - and I had NO idea what the hell it meant.   Good luck with the project devs.","Mar 6, 2019 at 8:22 AM",4, 16,

2022-05-28 19:33:58.657628,Henri1970,Some issues,"I decided to give this a try and at first it started all the graphics were double vision, then it crashed. 2nd try it said something about an update. After the update it would no longer start.","Mar 2, 2019 at 12:25 AM",1, 20,"My apologies, it appears the incorrect version was released."
