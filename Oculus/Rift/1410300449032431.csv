2022-05-28 17:04:09.210258,Xampert,abandoned,"Do not buy this game
It hasnt been updated in more then 6 months even though the dev talked about adding content every other week.","Jun 20, 2018 at 9:47 PM",1, 9,"We have not abandoned the project we are in the process of updating all the textures and effects in the game.

We are sorry you feel this way but we think that improving the overall quality and performance of the game is important for everyone to have a better experience."
2022-05-28 17:04:09.225218,Renemouse,Not bad but other titles offer more,"This is a nice looking wave shooter but currently a bit lacking in polish. It's quite grindy and there doesn't appear to be any way to gain upgrades or powerups during gameplay, which means the first few times you play you're just using the pistol and nothing else. Shooting feels alright but enemies don't really react when you hit them and its often unclear if you're doing damage or just pinging their armor.  Compared to other titles this doesn't stand out right now but it does have potential.","Jan 6, 2018 at 2:44 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:04:09.241176,neuoc,good but no sound,silnt nogun sound no sound,"Jan 20, 2018 at 11:58 AM",4, 0,I'm sorry to hear you are having issues with audio. This is usually caused by not restarting Oculus home after changing your default audio device Im sure after a reset all audio should work :)
2022-05-28 17:04:09.257133,KraftHP,Good so far. Something seems off though?,"I am writing this with the understanding that this is an early game... and that some things arent completed yet. That being said, while playing, there is very limited audio. Currently I only hear anything when i interact with a menu item, kill something, or hear the announcer every now and then. I dont hear any weapons, shots, enemies (other than the snake thing) and I dont hear any music. Is that correct as of now, or is there something I am missing?

I looked in settings, but couldnt find anything. And like I said, I can hear some things... but not everything. 

Other than that, this game seems pretty great. :) I will update if the problem sorts itself out, or if I somehow get it working again.","Nov 15, 2017 at 3:49 PM",4, 3,"I'm sorry to hear you are having issues with audio.
