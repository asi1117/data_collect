2022-05-28 18:54:26.843003,weejasper,,"i gave this game 5 stars because while it might not be the best game around it was free and I appreciate the effort that you guys went through putting it together. If you had the physics worked out I would  have paid to play it.

thanks","Nov 25, 2019 at 10:02 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 18:54:26.856966,TrooperUndead,Poohl,"I'm left handed... um.. needs some work... like a lot of work.
At least we don't have to pay to find that out.
Only gave it one star because i couldn't choose no stars.","Jun 20, 2019 at 4:14 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 18:54:26.871926,VibrationsOfDoom,VERY awkward physics...,"First off, let's start off with the good... Nice pool room, bar, scenery especially, right on the waterfront. As others have said, though, it's VERY difficult to control the pool stick, and it actually operates the OPPOSITE of the way you normally shoot pool... Very frustrating, and I only did the first two difficulty levels... Afterawhile I finally figured it out, but its very tricky to get anywhere with this game... Dunno, there's less frustrating games out there... No english, no over the top shots, it just doesn't feel natural at all, and I'm a semi regular pool player...","Apr 11, 2019 at 11:10 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 18:54:26.887884,Hicks613,1 handed pool done WRONG.,"So essentially youre forced to aim with one hand, place the cue in space.  Then using your other hand to slide placed cue on a fixed axis.

I understand why this is free, but what a waste of hard drive space.

This would be decent pool game for a GO or Samsung Gear VR user.  Any single controller type VR.   But this is clearly not meant for Rift with Touch.","Apr 20, 2019 at 9:12 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 18:54:26.901846,Hallofpool,why put bad stuff up?,"Why put this on the store?  It is essentially unplayable.  The physics are all off to such a degree that it should be done over completely.  It looks like the devs ported a bad mobile app to vr and didn't even test to ensure it worked properly.  Also, why port a bad game to vr and expect good results.  it takes more to dev in this enviroment, but the rewards of getting it right are very high.  Please get away from the aim - click - stroke controls.  Is that how you play for real?  No way!","Nov 17, 2018 at 1:22 PM",1, 14,
2022-05-28 18:54:30.024494,Jooki,This is awful !!!,"You can't grip the cue with the back hand and even when you do it does not follow your hand movements. There are plenty of other pool games out there that work, this has been poorly designed and they need to go back to the drawing board.","Dec 4, 2018 at 3:16 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:30.039454,Dyslogix,Graphics were ok but ..,"For me it was unplayable, the cue wouldn't function properly, it wouldn't strike the balls adequately, if those were fixed, i'd be in my element :) 
I know it's early days yet, so i'll give this what i believe it could be. I did love the graphics portion, and the movement is always good when it's not teleporting you around. I will pop back and make my alterations to my review once the game has come out of it's early stage :)
Best of luck.","Nov 16, 2018 at 2:52 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 18:54:33.199004,trainthethird,Unplayable,Buggy controls prevented me from even lining up one shot correctly. Might be cool once it gets updated/fixed. Not even worth downloading for free in its current state.,"Nov 8, 2018 at 3:09 AM",1, 2,"We apologise for inconvenience caused. We will surely try to fix controller thing in coming update.
