2022-05-28 19:44:11.070925,VVirus,Neat little puzzler,"As it is now Trains VR is a cute little game for puzzler enthusiasts with plenty of levels bonus challenges and trophies. The theme is perfect for this kind of game and looks quite adorable.

Altought there are some UI/UX issues the developrs said they are addressing those in the near future so thats great!","Sep 23, 2018 at 5:23 PM",5, 1,"Hello VVirus, thanks for your review! :) We've updated the game, we fixed UI problems, so game is much more pleasant to play now :)"

My Thoughts:
I had some major issues with this title on the Oculus Rift, I could not ride the trains as I was too small to see out the windows which is a shame becuase I think it would have enhanced this experience.
The graphics on the Rift appear low poly and didn't really impress me, however checking the store I noticed the game is also available on the Gear VR and Oculus GO, so this would explain why.
The lack of a decent tutorial also hindered some of my progress, but the puzzle element of the game were pretty decent and fun.
Check out my video to see all the faults and flaws I experienced.","Sep 4, 2018 at 11:10 PM",3, 4,"Hello, ParadiseDecay!
Thanks for sharing this great review with us. We're currently working on ironing out the issues caused by the platform transition, so stay tuned for the updates & patches. As for tutorial - we'll be adding them into the game shortly and for now, you can find them on our Steampage under the latest announcement.
UPDATE: We've updated the game, so it suits better for Rift platform :) You can check it out if you'd like!"

Unfortunately, on the Rift, the UI is basically unusable: attempting to turn or resize the table yields random results - sometimes partly working, usually doing nothing, occasionally teleporting me across the room where I stare at what appear to be trophies on the wall.  Looking at another review I can only guess this was designed for a different platform.  I don't recommend buying it on Rift until the UI works properly.","Sep 7, 2018 at 10:13 AM",1, 2,"Hey, ericle7! Thanks for the feedback. Right now we're focused on fixing any issues present in the game due to platform transition, so stay tuned!
UPDATE: We fixed problems with Rift platform - it should work smoothly now :)"
