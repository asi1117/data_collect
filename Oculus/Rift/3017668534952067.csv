2022-05-28 20:32:35.488641,Zastyun_32,Needs work,I was dissapointed the controls are overly simplistic. I kept getting stuck because the controls were so bad.,"Mar 6, 2021 at 5:54 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:32:35.504598,Metalsech,Needs Work,"I was looking forward to this. Graphics are functional. Seems creepy. Like the idea of procedural scares, more games need to offer that. But devs....seriously you need to sort out control options. There's literally no options for controls at the moment. I want to use right stick to turn - smoothly, not in flippin incremental steps like most devs somehow think people want. But at the moment I can't use it at all. The best thing to do would be to implement a variety of control options. But at the very least the left stick should allow you to move forwards/backwards and strafe left/right, and the right stick should allow you to turn smoothly left/right. Turning physically is all well and good but you just end up getting tangled in the wire of the headset. Also the movement speed could be increased a bit. Maybe put movement speed in options too. Then why not add a head bob mode to make you bob up and down when you walk to increase feeling of walking. Sort these things out and you may start to have an experience that people want to play.","Aug 31, 2020 at 5:15 PM",2, 9,
2022-05-28 20:32:35.519559,Angelina Starr,Definitely not there yet,Controls don't work properly and the game is s-l-o-w and boring.  I realize this is a demo but nothing in here entices me to come back and check out the full version at all.,"Aug 24, 2020 at 7:24 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 20:32:35.534519,StrangeGames,Good start,The game looks good but the biggest problem is the controls. The movement speed is slow and really needs to support seated gameplay for those of us who need to play seated.,"Sep 25, 2020 at 7:05 AM",4, 1,
