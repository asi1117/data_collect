2022-05-28 20:27:17.168270,HackBuster,Pretty decent game in my opinion,"I played for around 20-30 mins (couldn't play long as my food was done) but I had fun, thankfully there was multiple ways to move the paddle which was with turning my controler as the other way to move is by tilting your head which hurts mine XD.

The only thing I would say needs changing is the direction the ball goes. As when I played and I shot the ball away from myself it went to the left where I think it should be better if it went straight ahead of the player or in a direction the player would like. 

Or if the whole ball shooting left makes more sense it probably might be also better if it can also shoot right at the same angle so the player can easily decide which direction the ball should go?

But anyways, the game was fun to play with decent brick health and upgrade mechanics which is an awesome addition as you can get more HP, higher speeds and even a fireball where the ball break the blocks in an area of effect so that's pretty nice!","May 26, 2021 at 9:53 AM",5, 1,
