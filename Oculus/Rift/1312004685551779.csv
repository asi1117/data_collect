I also have to acknowledge the the controls to move around and scale your perspective were nice and well done. It even has a multiplayer capability which would be useful to show the scene to other team members quickly. But unfortunately as a true prototype tool, this is not very helpful. Might as well just plop objects in Unity Editor and put on the headset to get the same experience, but with the actual ability to code in functionality that you might want to see in a prototype experience. Main reason I wouldn't give this 5-stars is that this is marketed as something that would compete with a game engine, but prototypes need more than just visuals, needs functionality. This does not supply that feature set like a game engine would. Plenty of apps just like it: Blocks, Tilt Brush, Medium, etc.","Mar 17, 2020 at 6:30 AM",3, 87,

2022-05-28 14:06:19.176525,1ce_man,Not worth it at this time,"This gets 2 stars from me for simple reasons. You can't properly snap items together, you can't level or align objects so everything is always off and the tools aren't that useful overall. The multiplayer only works if you already know people and you share a link with them. You have to be pretty good at art to get any kind of use out of this. Such a shame to, because the export feature looked good.","Jun 18, 2019 at 12:46 PM",2, 33,
