2022-05-28 12:36:40.225580,Espionage724,"Works with G920, RX 580, and Air Link","At the time of writing (May 2021), the Logitech G920 force-feedback wheel works perfectly. For a quick run-down as to how this wheel works: by-default it's a Xbox One wheel. When you connect it to a PC, it starts in Xbox mode. You need Logitech's driver (newer G HUB or older Gaming Software) installed and running on your PC, and if it is, it will switch the wheel to PC mode upon plugging it in. Your wheel needs to be in PC mode in order for games (and Project CARS) to detect it.

I use the lowest settings with a RX 580 and Quest 2 (90Hz at 1.0x render resolution). Maintains 90 FPS most of the time. Normally use wired Link, but surprisingly Air Link works fantastic.

There's also command-line arguments available, but in order to use them with the Oculus version, you need to create a shortcut, add the options, and launch PCARS from that shortcut. Some useful ones are -dx11mt -vrnomirror -skipcrowds -pthreads 4.","May 25, 2021 at 9:02 AM",5, 34,

(you do have to remap the pedals etc in game.. But it all works fine.. breathe easy).


I picked the game up as a return to sim racing for me. It was on sale, worked with vr, why the hell not?

What you get is great immersion, and graphics and aggressive AI and dynamic weather and so much more..

Lots of fun, despite lack of online support (project cars 3 out now lol), 

Looking to get lost in a good sim ? Look no further.

Good: graphics, gameplay, weather, handling, debris, tires

Not so good: menu interfaces are hard to read 

Bad: lack of multiplayer online.","Jun 3, 2021 at 11:56 PM",5, 13,

And having played it now, I see the frustration. However, I am the owner of both an xbox and a wheel. And I have to say, if you have a wheel, BUY THIS GAME! It enhances it so much and makes it so much more realistic. HOWEVER If you have a weak stomach or don't have a xbox controller, this game isn't for you.

2022-05-28 12:36:52.831796,STARGÅTER1,Totally rate this,"I'm a vr noob but lifetime gamer and I have to say this game actually surprised me. I wasn't expecting my pc to run it on quest 2 link but boy this game is so realistic in vr. If you've got a good spec pc the opposition's cars draw distance would look better but this game looks and feels like your on the road in a real car. There are a few basic scaling tweaks you can do in game to make it feel more to scale even though it's pretty much perfect out of the box. Works well with the Xbox one controller and after a short time of adjustment you realy forget your in a game at all. It's the closest I've come to driving a car without driving a car and I've played all the top driving games over the years. Vr and this game beats the lot. The only thing that would make this more real is a steering wheel set up and haptic feedback. For the price tag you would be nuts not to get this.
I'm using quest2 link 1050ti i7 3series  16gb ram and it runs fine appart from the other cars on the road look basic after about 15 yards draw distance. But that doesn't realy take anything away from the natural realism or experience that this game offers. I can live with that small compromise on my low end pc. Otherwise it's perfect. You can tell they put a lot of effort into building this game.","Jan 12, 2021 at 9:13 AM",4, 39,

2022-05-28 12:36:55.988506,songo_ku,The best VR Game for racing wheel so far,"The game is a great simulator and if you have a racing wheel it runs like a dream! Checking your side mirrors when force-feedback does it best to get you even more immersed - unforgettable. Here is a comment from my friend when asking him how is it while being immersed - ""it's real!"".  Got it running with no issues on Rift and Quest via Link. Runs on pretty much most of the hardware (GTX 1070/ I7 16GB RAM laptop it literally flies - I figured that with a bit of a trick you can even get it running with 1050ti ). If you find your pedals not working etc. make sure you have your (Logitech or other) software installed and configured well, then make sure that relevant supported version of the wheel is selected in the configuration of the game. Finally check the calibration etc. It may take a while but when you get it all right, it is awesome.
I saw that game got some unflattering reviews - this game is a simulator and you definitely need a wheel to appreciate it. It is certainly not a NEED FOR SPEED type of a game so it may not suit everybody. Let's see if EA wakes up and delivers some Hot Pursuit VR to the broader audience here.","Nov 18, 2020 at 7:08 AM",5, 41,

Gameplay 10/10, 5 stars and all that. When it works, it is absurdly fun, with good mechanics and plenty of great cars and tracks to choose, fun, as well as pretty good graphics.

2022-05-28 12:37:14.971040,EddieMal,Everything I expected,"Read the reviews and was a bit worried that I would suffer some issues, I did but none that couldnt be fixed.
Spactacular scenery, detailed tracks a totally imersive game.
Problems
1. Menus at 90 degrees to view angle, reset the app view fixed in 2min.
2. Menu navigation, lift the headset go to options and set the VR crosshair delay to select by looking at the option.
3. This is my most anoying issue, Logitech G920 pedals reversed, this took some experimenting but I found the solution in the contoller options, the game correctly I dentifies the G920 and loads the profile, no matter how I fiddled with this and the Logitech profiles in LGS 9.02 I couldnt find the right combo, in desperation I changed to the Logitech Force feedback Pro profile and bingo pedals in the right places all the other controls worked just as if it was the G920 problem solved and onto the game.

My first impression was WOW! I've been playing Dirt Rally VR and PCars is so much better for a lesser skilled driver, more forgiving when you get it wrong.

Setup is : WIN 10
MSI Gaming 7 MB
i5 4670K CPU
ASUS  GTX1060 GFX
32Gb Corsair Vengence RAM

No issues with stuttering, view distance or heat.  It tok less than an hour to get the problems described above resolvedwhich if I compare to the grief of setting up my X-55 controllers in Elite Dangerous, its trivial.

So dont be put off by the bad reviews there is plenty of info on how to resolve the anonying issues, give it a go, everytime I get a new VR game it needs some TLC before I get the best from it.

Maybe racing sims just aren't for me, but I feel as though other games have held my attention much longer.  Thinking back to the hours spent just roaming on Need for Speed on the PS Vita or hopping into impromtu races on Forza and other titles, customizing and unlocking new parts for my cars, finding secrets around the world..

2022-05-28 12:37:43.393066,AndrewR,Of 20 games - Only Sever VR Sickness,"I knew the risks, but my body betrayed me.  I had such a bad case of VR Sickness following my first two attempts to drive the go-cart around 3-laps, that I broke out into a cold sweat from head to toe and was nauseated for three hours afterwards. I literally tore off my headset off during my 2nd set of 3 laps.  This is the only game that I deeply regret because of the unstable horizon, shaking chassis, and overall experience.  I realize there are some advanced settings in the .INI that I can use to stabilize the horizon, but I'm genuinely afraid to ever launch this particular game again.  I've had better VR experiences on VorpX emulation of non-VR Games.  This is the only purchase that I genuinely regret.  I love racing games.   I don't blame my hardware, because I have a high-end PC (i7-6700k @ 4.4GHz with dual GeForce GTX 1080 SLI).  The framerate was not the problem.  I've never had such a violent physiological stress response to anything.  I had sweat poured out of every pore of my body such that it soaked my shirt and pants.  Because of that reaction, I really haven't even put my headset back on for the last two months.   Prior to this, I was playing nightly for 2-3 hours.  I attempted a refund after the 14-day period (because this was such a profoundly sickening experience), but it was rejected.  The graphics were good.  The car control was challenging (even for just the go-carts at training levels).   However, the vibration and horizon made me violently ill.  The closest analogy I can make are some of the migraines that I got when I was younger.  The Migranes would cause intense nausea and vomiting.  After playing, I ended up taking a cold shower and laying down in the dark for three hours. I realize how ridiculous this sounds, but I can’t control how my body responds.

The career mode seems to work now. After doing some research it seems like it is a well know issue that the game does not record any of your lap times ever, somehow it still exists. There's still no multiplayer games shown when I select browse games, maybe no one plays this online anymore?

I played it at one of my friends with a driving seat, and it was awesome, now I own an Oculus, and we're yet to try combining the two of them. First time I tried it with Oculus, it gave me motion sickness straight away, but I realized, you get motion sickness, if the ""camera"" moves, when your head actually doesn't. So my advice is to everyone, if you're using a VR headset with this game, simply turn off the head movements and reactions in the settings.

However, I do have other complaints.
There's never an online game available?? WTF is the point in playing a racing sim if not to play against other people? Can't play against other people, useless. 

The option to stare at a specific menu option is available, but you can also use the controller to select menu items. Problem with this is there is way to turn it off that I've found, and I've gone through the menu options one by one hoping to find the option to turn it off. I don't have time to read the information on screen before it selects some random thing that the cross hair happens to be pointed at. 

E-Brake ~ There is an E-Break, but it doesn't break at all. This just means you can rev your engine while stationary or moving, it doesn't hinder movement ~AT ALL~ So no whipping around really tight corners. You're just going to go off track as all it technically does it put you in neutral. I was pointed uphill and used the ""E-Brake"" but the car started rolling downhill (it could barley be called a ""hill"") 

Using a controller ~
I have a controller, there is no ""slightly turning"" it's like their controller settings are designed to fixed degree points. Which forces you to over/understeer. Likely better with a steering wheel, but I already spent the money on the game and wanted to make sure that I liked the game before investing the money into a steering wheel. 

This game doesn't feel like a simulation to me, more like a cockpit viewed racing game (other view options are available) with a VR headset that lets you look around. I in no way feel like I'm actually there. Random ""bump"" noises when traveling at low speeds while easing on the throttle. I would rather play The Crew on PS4 as a simulator than this. 

Totally not worth the investment, specifically without the online races being available.","Nov 14, 2017 at 6:01 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 12:37:49.727345,ch4ron,Disaster.,This game has been ported to Oculus. And it suck$. Going throug menu (which you see as screen in front of you) is pain in the a$$. You must stare at one piont for three seconds keeping crosschair at manu item. But sometimes crosschair disapears. So you shake your head hoping that it will bring him back. Another problem is support for steering wheel. I've got Logitech G29 which should be OK. But it's not. Sometimes it works OK but mostly it's configuration becomes random. You go through all the pain with menu just to find out that you car starts going backwards at full speed at no reason. Or it doesn't going anywhere despite your efforts with steering wheel and pedals. If you thinking about buing Project Cars knock your head on your desk and buy Asseto.,"Nov 5, 2017 at 3:43 AM",1, 9,

The big deal was how much detail they put into the survey and accuracy.  Well, I just ran through it several times in Project Cars. Amazing. My throttle and braking reflexes carried right over. 

Regarding the VR bit -- I'm really impressed with the font -- it's easily readable, much more so than the fonts in Elite Dangerous.

About control -- I have an Obutto + Logitech G35 sitting next to me but just played with the Oculus and Xbox One controller tonight, still felt amazing.

I think some of the negative reviews might stem from this being closer to a simulator than an arcade racer. You will have to be very touchy with throttle and braking to keep these cars where you want them. This is not Need For Speed.

It is awful, barely functional software.

The control system in VR is awful - look and hold your look at something to basically press A on it. I had an xbox controller and a G25 steeringwheel plugged in - neither of them had any input or control in the menus... so just navigating the thing is awful.

It crashes in the unskippable (yes thats right) intro video 8/10 times.

It disabled keyboard input when you run it in VR... but you have to input your name to start the career... Class A bug. Well done lads!

In the options menu it said the G25 was the default controller... finally managed to get in to a solo race (with an exhuasted neck due to looking at the back button in the top left corner to navigate through menus)... and the G25 had no input... nor did the xbox controller... nor the keyboard.

It also looked horrifically low res in game too.

It is the absolute worst of all VR games I've played. After spending 2 hours getting it working, and figuring out how to navigate the menus... 0/10. VFM: £Dont buy it.","Apr 8, 2017 at 10:19 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 12:38:08.737975,kbyte9001,Fun game that runs perfectly,"I have read many reviews on this game through the Oculus store, and it definately seems mixed.  I originally downloaded the Pagani free edition from Steam to test this before i bought and it worked well enough.  Once this went on sale as the full version here, I jumped on it.  I run an i7 4790, 32GB RAM, SSD, Nvidia 1070, Windows 10 and a Thrustmaster TMX forcefeedback wheel and pedals(about a 200.00 wheel).  I set the graphics level to medium overall on my first try and everything was smooth, will try to bump that up and see how it goes.  As for controller setup, I had no issue getting things configured, used the included Xbox controller to initially get through the wheel configuration, however if you are going to play with the Xbox controller, you probably shouldn't have to do any extra configuration.  As for some people stating that if you stare to long at one point, yes it will select things, it's not horrible, it's meant for those who just want the ability to look and select with the headset, that's it.  Overall this is a very immersive game (especially if you have a wheel and pedals), and it looks pretty good.  One other nice thing is watching replays in VR, gives a different perspective. As someone who has been gaming for years, it's odd to be able to look around during the replay, but in a good way.  For 26 bucks give or take, this is a really good title, just dont expect it to be an arcade racer, this is more of a serious driving game.

2022-05-28 12:38:21.457402,mattyj1974,Good game but I find the career to slow,The graphics are good and the racing is fine. I am just find dirt rally to be more interesting and challenging than whizzing wound and round a track. The career mode progresses at a snails  pace with too may rounds conducted in the same country with similar tracks. Needs more variety in the career mode.,"Nov 13, 2016 at 4:42 AM",4, 0,

Looks fine on my monitor, but WILL NOT run on my headset. My computer is overspec in every category: twin 970s, i7-6700k @ 4.8 GHz, 32gb of drr4 3000 ram..... no idea what the issue is, but it's a frustrating 30ish dollar bath that I'm taking.","Dec 24, 2016 at 2:19 AM",1, 13,
