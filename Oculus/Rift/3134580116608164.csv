2022-05-28 20:30:02.733919,revorT,VR Art Gallery,It s more or less a VR art gallery of someone else's work. You just go in and look at stuff. Not a very engaging or good story.  I did'nt make it very far.,Jan 20 at 7:54 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 20:30:02.748879,DelapierceD,"Excellent ""Gallery""","Works as a gallery for the artist's work, but much more engaging than just showcasing the art. Love the journey through the idea of art itself and the artist's relationship to it. Excellent use of VR for art. Thank you!","Mar 9, 2021 at 6:17 AM",5, 0,Thank you so much! Brings joy to our hearts that you enjoyed it!
2022-05-28 20:30:02.764836,Pickletoaster289,This was an amazing experience!,"I have really been into art recently, and I stumbled opon this while looking something out of the box. It has an amazing vibe and makes you feel good. This is a very unique story and I really enjoyed the experience. Very calming and makes you think.","Dec 28, 2020 at 5:57 AM",5, 1,"Thank you for your wonderful words, we're so happy you stumbled across it!"
2022-05-28 20:30:02.779797,chukb2012,Loved the art,"Not really my kind of thing, but i decided to plummet into it anyways. I really liked how you guide us through your experience of you blossoming into an amazing artist.","Jul 19, 2020 at 1:01 PM",4, 2,Thank you so much!
2022-05-28 20:30:02.794757,FastLawyer,Art and the artist,"This is a really well-done, guided & narrated artistic experience. You get to not only see the art, but see the process of art. Maybe get to know a little about the artist as well. My only complaint is that there is only teleportation, there is no smooth or snap turning. And there are only a few basic interactions. Whole things takes about 8 minutes. Anyways, kudos to Emma ... hope to see your work in a real-life gallery someday.","May 26, 2020 at 2:28 PM",4, 3,"Thank you so much - for doing the experience, and for your feedback!"
2022-05-28 20:30:05.906558,nightcat.mau,Amazing!,"This was a wonderful experience. It reminds me of how decades ago when at college, our art professor would drive hell for leather to take us to the Warhol or to an art supply store. Said professor would have loved this. You get to explore the art gallery, then inside the paintings and studio itself. If you love going to modern art installations, you will adore this experience.","May 25, 2020 at 12:05 AM",5, 3,Ah! This makes us so happy to hear! I bet we would have loved your professor :)
2022-05-28 20:30:05.921518,cestomano,Good art experience,"Good simple art experience, where you'll know the artist and her work. It's like a curriculum (or book) of the artist but well presented and nice.","May 28, 2020 at 5:55 PM",5, 2,Thank you!
2022-05-28 20:30:05.936478,Active6,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Gosh this looks so good an real i love this, the art making that, going deeper in someone´s mind and with those sayings! love it","Sep 14, 2020 at 7:25 AM",5, 0,Thank you!!! We'll let you know if we make more like this :)

2022-05-28 20:30:05.969391,sergejivancuk,good experience and bad programming,"Very interesting application scenario and interesting voice-over artist and artist's paintings, very unusual and impressive. But the programmers didn't work well. Very inconvenient control , when moving the left trigger, I often fell out through the geometry of the level, please fix it!","Jun 5, 2020 at 2:35 AM",3, 0,"Thank you for pointing this out, it looks like we uploaded the build with one of our experimental locomotion systems!"
