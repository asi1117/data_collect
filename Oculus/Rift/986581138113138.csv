Im just wording if there will be a fix to it soon if ever. I've played it on other headsets when going to a gaming center.

That happens only when I am getting REALLY immersed in a VR game...! I like it when they sometimes use the Japanese language to say some strange things while these robots are coming. This gives it really a special atmosphere! I am only at the beginning of the game, let's see how this will develop... Will update later.","Mar 19, 2020 at 5:18 AM",4, 29,

2022-05-28 14:51:30.378467,JackDiddley,"Great Game, Took Some Time To Grow On Me","I first played this game months ago on a free play weekend.  At that time I went through the tutorials, considered it another wave shooter and put it away.
This game is fun and actually EXCITING, and I'm only on the 6th mission.  The four different playable characters are each unique and powerful enough that they are fun to play.  The gun, sword, and bow mechanics are each impressive, and the pace of the game is perfect.  It isn't a mad rush, but it isn't a slow easy walkthrough either.  I like that the difficulty can be adjusted as well.
This will be a go-to game for me for a good while.","Jul 5, 2019 at 3:30 AM",5, 12,

Tutorialen fungerte ikke, så jeg vet ikke om det er noe bra jeg ikke har fått med meg, men når ting ikke fungerer så betyr det meget lite.
Jeg gjorde et mission, meget kjedelig wave-shooter opplegg. Det jeg savnet var utfordring og variasjon, jeg var udødelig og fienden virket inkompetent og ufarlig.

2022-05-28 14:51:33.511735,taquitobuddy,Great game with a gamebreaking bug,"I completed the entire game on Hard Coop with my wife, and we had fun with it.   It holds up well even today with great voice acting and solid gameplay.  I also tried all 4 characters and unlocked all their abilities.  I only really enjoyed the Gun Cleric, but I like that all 4 had very different playstyles.  Although it only has 10 missions they have a good bit of diversity.  In any case, this WAS going to be a solid 4-star game I could easily recommend.  It has some minor issues, and no AI bots means that multiplayer is completely dead and you can't PvP, but still an easy 4-star recommend for the single player PvE or Coop PvE if you have a VR friend. 

HOWEVER, there is a bug on the Oculus Home version where progress is not always saved.  You might play for 2-3 hours, unlock tons of stuff, then quit and come back to find out 100% of that progess is gone.  What's funny/frustrating is that I still have all the Oculus Achievements for doing the unlocks, but all that progress in-game was erased.  At this point, I'm sure this bug will never be fixed since the game is so old, so buyer beware.  Only do 1 mission, then quit the game and load it back up to see if progress has saved.","Mar 28, 2019 at 3:51 PM",3, 69,
2022-05-28 14:51:33.527691,Leopardchaun,Great game but multiplayer is dead.,"Game has a great story line, considering the short 10 missions its packed in to (first 2 rooms are the same, the other 8 are different, and the mechanics vary for each one). And minimal glitches, the only attack that feels clumsy is punching.  Bow works better than bows in most other VR games, same with swords.  Pistol and shotgun guy are fun too.

You unlock 6 total skills with each 4 characters as you play with each one.  Characters and skills are diverse enough to make multiple play throughs feel like different game play.

Multiplayer is dead.  No one else is ever on, can never join any other match, have tried at every time of day every day of the week.  Game would be way more fun otherwise.  Wish they would cut price to free or a couple dollars to boost the player base.

Smooth Locomotion is available, other than just teleporting.  Turning is always at a 45 degree snap though.","Feb 2, 2019 at 2:44 PM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 14:51:33.541654,Bearfeetz,Seemed like a cool game,"Seemed cool until I started the tutorial mission, then I couldn't equip the sword. Spent 10 minutes trying to grab it from over my shoulder at every angle possible like a dummy. Got it once over extending with my left hand on the left shoulder but then I dropped it and couldn't get it again so gg. 

Also sucked won't let you use direct movement until you complete the tutorial and I hate teleporting. This game needs some serious attention. I don't know what kind of insanely small hitbox it has for the sword hilt but its ridiculous. Would return if I could but I waited too long.","Feb 17, 2019 at 2:40 PM",1, 5,

Just tried the free weekend and thought I need to support this game. The japanese robot kamakazi voice when the bomber robot comes out gave me goose bumps at first.
Yeah its a wave shooter I guess, but a really cool story behind and also a cool lobby of other players to join with (in real time, can see each other). Seriously, its good.

It's like an awesome wave shooter, but with the ability to teleport and freely walk around which bring different combat dynamics.

Original: 

I seriously regret having jumped the gun on my previous review. 

I encountered an apparently very rare bug where the game doesn't save, but this isn't a part of the game. Survios support was VERY fast in responding to my email, and the issue was fixed within a matter of hours of me emailing them. 

This game is a hardcore action game, that feels very fluid. I started out using the teleshift function, but now I play with walking locomotion, smooth turning, and the comfort mode turned off. 

The game is very solid, from the wave defense campaign and cooperative, to the king of the hill style pvp which is reminiscent of Overwatch in that the characters are all distinct in how they can be played. 

Despite my strong words previously,
Raw Data is a game worth having. 

Rather, if you have VR, and don't have this game, you're wasting time and money.","Sep 16, 2017 at 7:02 AM",5, 10,

I encountered a bug when I first downloaded and attempted to play, but the developers were quick to respond and issue a hotfix. Great job, guys! That being said, I really like this game. The graphics are polished and the voice acting is on point and amusing at times. The pistol feels like it has a bit of weight to it, and I like the mechanism for reloading. I try to always keep a fresh magazine in my off-hand for quicker reloads.  Headshots at a distance are hard to pull off, but hopefully I'll get better as I play more. Fighting off ""undead"" robots in the dark had my heart pounding... ""Where are they???"" I found the game immersive and fun, yet difficult at times.

2022-05-28 14:51:52.552712,WombatAR,"'Data' brings great ideas, tame delivery","Edited Review:
This new spin on robot defense has a lot of good ideas, but not if you're expecting a slicker version of Robo Recall.

There are a few things I found lacking in this game, but it would be unfair to compare only what other games have that Raw Data doesn't. So I'll start with what Raw Data has going for it.

Raw Data brings an assortment of character-customization options in the form of skills, powerful moves and four unique characters/classes, each with their own weapon specialties. The diversity between characters, as well as multiplayer co-op, should offer a lot of replayability.

This game tries new things in terms of gameplay, and mostly succeeds...if you don't mind waiting for the robots to come to you. Raw Data tries to be a story-driven arcade shooter/slasher, but misses its mark.

The story/gameplay: A plucky band of freedom fighters resists the machinations of an ""evil corporation"" by infiltrating various facilities, where they are inevitably attacked by robotic security.

Each mission takes place in a single area. Robots close in from all sides, and your options are to fight or die. Sometimes you defend a ""Data Core,"" sometimes you just try to survive, placing turrets to help you. The bottom line is that you're always going to be on defense.

Defense can be fun, though. In co-op, the rush of enemies forces players to work together in order to survive. Your options for killing enemies are limited--shoot, slash, or special ability, and repeat.

At no point are you the aggressor, and melee is almost pointless. In terms of your sheer number of options for destroying robots, Robo Recall does it better. For melee and improvization on the fly, Super Hot does it better.
Raw Data, however, gets marks for inginuity and effort, breaking new ground in character customization in a new medium. Kudos.

Bullet sponges. Enemies that take hundreds upon hundreds of sword slashes arrows or bullets show up and reduce the game to what is quite possibly the worlds worst Wii waggleathon/ button masher. This game loves them with a fiery passion I can't even begin to imagine loving anything. If it loved them with the passion of a first love it might have a fraction of them, with the love of a firstborn child maybe even an appreciable fraction. But its love for them goes beyond mere obsession or psychopathy into something wholly incomparable in human history.","Jul 26, 2017 at 3:11 AM",1, 11,

2022-05-28 14:52:05.236752,Angrydingo,Very disappointed,"The tutorial is the worst I've ever played.  

Movement via teleportation is horrible.  Using a joystick to rotate in a VR game is idiotic and this game is the worst I've played about having to always face forward.  Turning a tiny bit to either side brings up arrows telling the player to rotate the view instead.  Using one joystick to move and one to rotate is idiotic as well.  Once I have room scale, I hope I wouldn't have this problem, but many people have only two sensors so they should know about this problem.  Robo Recall has teleportation down perfectly (no additional click needed) and it doesn't need to use two joysticks.

Weapons are decent, but requiring a movement joystick to do double duty as a weapon option selector is stunning.  Don't they test funtionality?  Don't they play other games to see how things are done better?

No way is this game worth the money I played.  Until they get the movement right, I wouldn't even recommend this as a free game.  If they get the movement right, I still wouldn't recommend this game at the premium it's price.

I hate to be so negative, but without a trial, players need to know about this game before they pay a premium price.","Jul 16, 2017 at 5:27 AM",1, 18,

I like the holster and reload mechanic, but it gets a bit tired when game doesn't pick up your reload action.

Graphically it's quite pretty, when it isn't bugging, chopping, or tearing (which happens with some frequency). The weapons are a lot of fun to use and the reload mechanic is cute, when the tracking actually works and lets you draw your gun, or reload it without dropping it, or ready your special arrow, or draw your sword, and so on. Granted, ""When it works"" is most of the time, but not all the time, and issues pop up frequently enough that it feels less like a setup fluke, and more like an actual problem. More than any other title I've tried, this one NEEDS room scale. 

Movement is awkward and unintuitive. One stick controls forward/back/lateral movement, and the other the actual direction of view. The view direction stick also serves to call up your weapon context menu, however, so you often find yourself rotating your field of view when you intended to activate a special ability, or vice versa (if you're extra skilled, you can shift your field of view and THEN trigger a special at nothing). Walking style locomotion is available too, but (for me at least) the motion sickness becomes too much too fast (and PVP is all walking style), and even with the walking style, your field of view is still controlled with the stick. 

PVP and co-op is a lot of fun...when the netcode is stable and not laggy as heck.

While definately a longer title, what starts off as unique and refreshing gameplay is quickly replaced by uninspired waves of dramatically increasingly difficult enemies with a cookie cutter cyberpunk story going on around you. 

Despite its flaws, it's still one of the best wave shooters the rift has to offer and is more than worth grabbing on sale or in a bundle. A Triple A title that winds up about a b+","Aug 1, 2017 at 9:03 AM",3, 2,

Goal is not much different from Robo Recall - defeat wave after wave of enemies, but with many more creative ways to do it. But here are the cons. If you don't have 3 sensors it will kind of ruin the experience. You would not be able to turn around at all as the game expects you to face forward all the time (with joystick rotation). I disagree that Robo recall has a better teleportation mechanic, because its teleportation is slow and one-click is much faster for evading enemies. Don't like teleporting? you can walk, provided you can overcome the motion sickness. Lastly I think the menus could be more intuitive because it feels bulky like one of those Japanese games. Maybe make the player walk to more kiosks instead of selecting a menu.","Jul 24, 2017 at 6:24 AM",5, 2,

Enable smooth turning, if you decide to use that.

The special moves are okay, and the puzzles/survival rounds this game provide are very challenging and very fun when played with ""Likeminded"" people. all in all this is a good game.

However again the reason i deduct two stars is for locomotion and the sword controls feel ultra fake. The ninja like character's sword movements are not very convincing. and even though you can hack limbs off, the teleport mechanic always keeps you at a bit more than arms length which either makes you have to over extend your arms to hit, thus killing the immersion. Or Putting you too close to the bots to where you have to curl your arms in which then feels like you are throwing a cross and hook rather than swinging your sword.

The character known as ""Boss"" the shotgun is ultra wonky with pumping the shotgun and almost always results in never cocking the shotgun to be able to shoot. Especially in the laser dodging portion where movement and aim are key.

So two stars taken for the teleport mechanic and lack of fluid movement system. IMO Robo recall remains the best FPS on the market.","Mar 19, 2017 at 4:18 AM",3, 13,

It's in the works, yes, but this is a game that will rise above other shooters, and have its own true title. Good job devs.","Apr 28, 2017 at 7:51 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:52:30.570269,cybernettr,"Good Game, Bad Timing","This game had the misfortune of being released for the Rift AFTER Robo Recall. If it had been released months earlier, like on the Vive, it would have been much more impressive. That said, I actually like its slightly retro-futuristic graphics. It just doesn't ""wow"" to the same degree it might have at one time. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game, and I like the graphics and the first-person perspective, but it's not the first game to fight robots or to show a panoramic cityscape (ala Technolust) as it once was. Aside from that, there are other niggles, such as the teleporting control scheme and other controls. Teleporting isn't even as well implemented as on Robo Recall; I don't like how you use one control (a thumbstick) to teleport and another control (a button) to change direction. I wish game developers could get together and agree on some standard control scheme for all games, so you don't have to relearn everything or to mentally switch gears every time you launch a different game.","Mar 23, 2017 at 10:12 AM",3, 17,

Sorry you ran into this issue.
I responded to the bug report you submitted.

Talk to you soon!
UPDATE: Just wanted to let you know that our 0.7 Update should have fixed this issue. Now if you touch the Hand Scanner once, the percentage should fully go to 100% - You won't have to hold your hand for the whole duration.
Apologies again for the inconvenience this has caused you!"

Apologies for the negative experience you had with the game.

We'd really appreciate this information and would be more than happy to help troubleshoot any issues you've come across."
2022-05-28 14:52:33.791282,GunsGirlsGames,A shoot'em'up that'll satisfy!,"Having played SuperHot, Bullet Train, RoboRecall and a few others; Raw Data had some big shoes to fill. But its' certainly filled those shoes while also maintaining its own distinct personality. 
The gameplay (as of this review is still in Alpha) is frantic but well controlled; completed phases leave you feeling relieved. Multiplayer is where I feel this game really shines; you haven't lived until you've fist bumped someone who clearly doesn't speak your native language while dancing on a pile of robot corpses. 
There are some drawbacks: for instance odds and ends on the bug side of things. However, it must be remembered that this is in fact an alpha and some leeway should be given in this respect. 
In conclusion I recommend this if you're looking for a shooter you can play with random strangers online and have a blast doing it. It's already solid and will only improve with beta and the full release.","Mar 18, 2017 at 11:16 PM",4, 7,

However in the single player game you dont really move so thats not so bad.
When I was in the main room with the other people I did not feel the movement worked at all.   Has alot of potential.  Look foward to the next update.  I would add regular movement and make it players option.","Mar 19, 2017 at 9:58 PM",3, 1,
