PLEASE NOTE:  (I discovered this further information 2 days after my impressions video above) - I noticed on Steam this game is still in Early Access, there is no mention of this on the Oculus Store, so my impressions video above is based on me thinking this was the final product. However my 2 star rating still stands untill further content is added. 
My rating could change as the experience adds new content, so watch this space.

My Thoughts:
Waba is cute and cuddle, his physics are really good but the rest of the experience is very bland and feels like it's lacking content. There are only 3 different scenarios as far as I could find and you don't really do anything in them. I was expecting a virtual playground of things to do, but there isn't any... so I was really disappointed.","Jul 14, 2018 at 4:54 PM",2, 12,"Thanks for the review! I contacted Oculus and they forgot to add the early access banner, sorry for the confusion. Waba is definitely in early access, and hence the small price. It's a small, humble experience right now, but it is high quality and very polished. The plan is to add more content, more virtual pet like features, more playzones, etc... in future updates over the next year. Appreciate you checking it out!

There's also a discord where you can chat directly with the developer https://discord.gg/CV2Z9VX"
