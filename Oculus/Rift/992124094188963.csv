2022-05-28 14:10:32.361677,WG1,5+ For experienced VR racing sim players,"Can't believe the level of dunceness of some of these reviews.
On Title screen, hit ENTER, game will start. 
Yes, this is a racing car sim, you need a wheel like all good racing sims.
All the negative reviews are due to inexperience , get good you all !

Graphics defaults to low, I set options to Ultra, works excellent with i7 4820K
Rift S, and 1070.

Using the PXN racing wheel and pedals, best wheel controller for the price, emulates the Xbox controller, only needs some adjustment with the sliders to dial in.

My favorite is Hill Climb Pikes Peak, I can practice Pikes Peak every day and actually 
train for the real course.","Jan 14, 2021 at 4:59 PM",5, 97,

2022-05-28 14:10:32.390600,Dhan67,Good enough! With a gamepad or wheel.,"I was not able to run this game through Virtual Destop but it works just fine using Oculus Link with my Oculus Quest 2. even with a usb 2 cable. 

While loading the game, I got stuck at the warning screen with the Oculus controllers but I was able to get through using my gamepad so I guess my keyboeard would have done the trick too. 

So... The game needs a pad or wheel to work. Oculus controlers alone won't do. 
6 locoations with 12 tracks each is good enough for the $6.00 CAD I paid. I really like this game in VR with ultra settings as it runs really smooth using my new RTX 3070. Now I just need to buy a 16 feet usb 3 cable to reduce compression and make it look event better. That or figure out a way to make it work using Virtual Desktop.","Dec 29, 2020 at 2:11 AM",5, 26,

2022-05-28 14:10:38.734869,AlnilamAlnitak,Pretty Real Driving,"When I installed the game and started it, I couldn't go further than the ""Gamma settings"", which had a slider that worked when I moved it. Below it read ""Confirm"". Many times I tried to hit forward with the Enter button, but I couldn't move forward. I tried to start the game at least 4 times and thought about asking for money back. I didn't realize that the down arrow key had to select it ""Confirm"". Fortunately, however, I eventually chose it. I didn't notice it was a separate radio button. Without glasses, poor eyesight. Later, when playing, that ""gamma setting"" is no longer asked.
The game is absolutely brilliant. Everything runs smoothly and driving with the wheel is enjoyable. Close-up resolution is good, if you look far, it might be better. I have an i7 4770K processor, a Geforce 1660Ti graphics card and 8gt DDR memory and the game runs at ULTRA settings. The wheel is a Logitech MOMO.
I play this on Oculus Quest VR glasses through the Oculus PC application
Many reviews have been given 1 star. I don't know all their problems. Some reviews have not made the game work. Well at least if the game worked then the game is worth at least 4 stars. Right now, I have a modest car with little power. The investments were 1-2. I have previous experience with a regular PC Dirt Rally game.

The good thing about Dirt Rally 1.0 vs 2.0, I can set the graphics preset at ULTRA, and the GPU is still capable of 'rendering' 90+ FPS.

If I want the same graphics quality in Dirt Rally 2.0 without the Famous studder issue, I need to set all the settings to Ultra as well (Wait, what ? ) and force Oculus  Rift to run at 45 FPS instead normal 90 FPS.  The difference ? 1 image every 22.22 ms is 45 FPS (Very stable) , or 1 image every 11.11 ms is 90 FPS with possible frame lost/drop and Timewarp lag (when Oculus Rift ASW kick in and out, beam me up Scotty).

How fast can you process and react to what you see when you drive at 100 mph on rally track ? Well, See you in Dirt Rally 1.0 !

If you got a T150 racing wheel or better and are able to change some options (what not everybody here seems to be capable of) then you will be rewarded with one of the finest racers in gaming history. It reminds me of good old Colin McRae Rally in every good aspect. *warning* the game is challenging! (For T150 users: you have a preset for the wheel.

The corners can be hard to determine in some locations, due a bit more to the screen door effect than anything.

This was on sale recently for £7.99 and I thought it was well worth trying it from the Oculus store and as long as I don't play for more than 2 hours if it looked rubbish I can at least apply for a refund.

I'm running a intel i5 - 4670k overclocked to 4ghz, MSI Nvidia GTX 970 4GB graphics card ( set to vr mode using the msi gaming app ) , 16gb dual core memory and a Samsung SSD ....I have the graphics set to medium and I have to say the game runs very smoothly and the graphics look great. I control the game with a Logitech G29 and that works flawlessly. The graphics suffer very little distance blurring that I used to get on my Lenovo WMR explorer headset, looks a lot crisper which enhances the immersion even more.

Now I am trying it on my i7-8087k/GTX 1080ti. Got it to load (takes about 3-4 minutes... not kidding) and configured my controls and got it to where I could drive it. One race (um, can't seem to find a ""practice"" type of mode) and it froze up on the ""Restart"" or ""Cancel"" screen. Not sure what the heck I am doing wrong. I am certain my machine is very capable of running this application. Most likely, I am just an idoit and can't figure it out. However, it is not very intuitive in my opinion. Also, the idea of having the HMD on while trying to navigate via the keyboard is a bit frustrating.

2022-05-28 14:10:54.539307,RuneSR2,Best racing game on the Rift,"Simply awesome, I forced super sampling 2.0 and was ready to face trouble when cranking up graphics to Ultra. But that didn't happen - the game performed smooth as butter, I did disable antialiasing though, the game worked fine with MSAAx2, but looked too blurry - and with super sampling 2.0 you don't need more antialiasing in this game. So graphics are awesome - and this game should perform great on all kind of hardware at or above minimum requirements. My specs: GTX 1080 (heavily oc'ed to 2100 Mhz boost and 11 Ghz mem), i7 7700K (4.5 Ghz), 16GB PC3200. 
In-game you can't change view, so you're stuck inside the car - but that's exactly what you are when driving in the real world. This game really feels like being there - directly participating as a race driver. 
I didn't pay the full price for this game - now I feel kinda bad. This game is truly worth the full price - and more. If you buy one racing game for the Rift, Dirt should be that game!

I have everything on ultra and the most it can be but still isn't too nice. The game also has a bland sense of color as it all is kind of...meh.

2022-05-28 14:10:57.678538,AHoboPanda,"Legitimate, In-Depth Review","DiRT Rally on the Oculus Store is the VR-only port of the popular DiRT Rally title. This review will have 3 parts: #1 about other reviews and hardware, #2 about gameplay, and #3 about performance/issues.

1) The reviews on here are very mixed, including multiple ""game doesn't launch"" reviews, but take them with a grain of salt. The game runs if you have decent hardware. I have an i7-4790K @ stock 4.0GHz, 16GB of DDR3 RAM, a GTX 1070, and the 2016 consumer model Oculus Rift on Windows 10, and the game runs fine.

2) The gameplay is incredible. Even on low-medium settings, it's very immersive, intense, and fun. This version is VR-only, so if you get nauseous in VR easily, I would recommend trying the Steam version, which you can play non-VR. If you don't get nauseous often in VR, or never get nauseous, then I absolutely recommend trying this game out if you're interested in racing/driving games. It's hard to describe how much fun this game is, try watching some videos about it. It's arguably better than any other racing sim game. And if you have the money to spend, get a wheel/pedal setup. I got mine for $346 after playing for a couple hours, totally worth it (Keyboard+Mouse works, recommend FFB Wheel or Gamepad, does NOT work w/ Touch controllers).

3) Performance wise, don't expect amazing graphics unless you have a GPU better than a 1070. I run on low-med settings, and the lowest I get is 86 fps in forests (lots of trees). Shadows look terrible unless set to Ultra, as do other things, but your car moves so fast that you won't really notice. At night, I sometimes have reflection issues when my car lights overlap with other lights, but otherwise it's great. Also, the lack of Steam workshop support (for obvious reasons) means you can't download tuning presets (you have to learn how to tune suspension, brakes, etc yourself via menus), and you have to cover the headset sensor to navigate menus while not wearing it.

That being said, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game!","Aug 18, 2018 at 2:21 AM",4, 107,

2022-05-28 14:11:03.970426,dangoran,Almost 5 stars,"I want to give this game 5 stars and I almost did despite some issues. I had this game on PSVR first but have since then moved to pc (pretty high end with a GTX 1080 Ti) and oculus. Love the game, especially some courses that really get the adrenaline pumping. Much better graphics on pc obviously wich doesn't really improve the gameplay too much but man it looks good. It's better but a bit more of a hassle to get things running...

I first forgot to install the drivers for my Thrustmaster T300 RS and had to map every controll manually and the game ran without force feedback. Dissapointing att first but it got solved. Like other reviewers have said, your mapping of controls is not saved and that really sucks. Should be easy for the developer to fix. Fortunately I only change button for the handbreak but I then have to do that every time I play.

Also annoying that you have to have a gamepad connected to start the game. I thought (hoped) that it would recognize my wheel as a controller, but it doesn't. A problem for me when I have 7 usb ports, wired keyboard, mouse and gamepad, 3 sensors and headset... I have to disconnect keyboard or mouse to be able to play the game.

When it comes to the game. As my rating implies, I love the gameplay. Different courses and different cars really adds variety.  To bad it doesn't have arcade settings like Dirt 4. This works for me but my girlfriend who really liked to play Dirt 4 doesn't what to play this one.","Oct 7, 2018 at 8:44 PM",4, 2,

Having played a ton of VR games already, I was keen to test out some driving / racing games, however I think somehthing like this is just far too indepth for me...

I'm sure if you're REALLY into rally / driving sims, you'll love this - However for me, just someone who wanted to experience driving in VR - it's just far too in-depth. Which of course is not a bad thing, if that's what you're after. 

My reason for only three stars however, is having played 20-30 VR titles already (including flight / space sims), this is the first to give me real bad motion sickness. I had to stop playing after about 3 mins into my first race.

Delete old downloaded files and do a fresh download/install. Remember if it never installs after you first download the game, then your file or the file you have is bad. They may have updated the install file to a newer version other than version 1.0 as Steam version is I think 1.23 or higher.

Idk if they fixed it yet or not, but I was able to download the game no problem, but when I hit run it would crash at the loading screen. Idk what the problem is and untill they fix it I'm gonna keep the 1 star rating.

Whatever the problems were it has been fixed now and it is a gripping and thrilling game. If you've got the graphics card to power it at max settings with 1.5 supersampling it's a beautiful game with tons of different cars, tracks and variety.

Pros:
1. Very nice graphics (scenery looks fantastic)
2. Great drive (Gamepad recommended, I do not have steering wheel)
3. Awesome race tracks with various difficulties.
4. Really feels like you are in the driver seat.
Cons:
1. About the driver seat. You have to stand to properly see out the window.
2. No support for touch contollers (really bummed out about that)
3. Not able to change POV position (ie. 1st person vs. 3rd person) 
4. Driver animation looks funny.
Verdict:
Money well spent for this highly immersive VR experience. This game will provide countless hours game play.","Sep 4, 2017 at 5:31 AM",4, 7,

Now let's talk a little about the game. The car choices are pretty large dating from old to new rally cars, you have three amazing game modes. The immersion is just outstanding, this is BY FAR the best simulation game for dirt racing, if not one of the best racing simulators.

2022-05-28 14:11:48.379522,Fantiseez,,"In August I purchased this game, and it flat out would not install, a few other reviewers had the same problem.  After seeing mostly positive reviews today, I downloaded it again, and it installs and works flawlessly. It's not everything I had hoped it would be, but it works now. Some aspects of the graphic design are poor, such as the interior of the car, co-driver, spectators, but when you're racing across a snow-covered, country road the last thing on my mind is my co-drivers oddly shaped hands, and lack of personality. As for motion sickness, I've only had had an issue my first couple races, and haven't had a problem with it since. Minecraft is actually more unsettling to me. 

If you buy this game, I hope you enjoy it. The races are very challening, and it does provide  many hours playability while trying to work up the ranks and purchase new cars, and upgrades.","Nov 2, 2017 at 1:45 AM",4, 6,

This game was kind of tough at first, but after putting a few hours into it, I really love it. The only thing that could possibly be any better would be Dirt 4. I PRAY that Dirt 4 gets released for Rift as well. There's absolutely nothing like it. I just feel way more in tune with my car. Enough that I was thinking about getting a steering wheel and/or pedals. If Dirt 4 gets released for Rift, I may make the jump. Until then, I'm still loving Dirt Rally. I've probably got more hours in this game than any 2 other games combined.","Jun 10, 2017 at 3:22 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 14:12:23.117141,Davey_B,Great but...,"You really need to include the 2D desktop version when paying top price for a game like this so you can play without the vr on all the time. I wish I bought it on steam as that includes both version for the same price.
UPDATE: The game no longer gets past the comfort screen so I guess we were only renting it!
Do not buy this.","Jul 5, 2020 at 10:30 PM",1, 16,

2022-05-28 14:12:29.450043,Litespeed,My favorite VR game so far,"Great rally racing game for those who seek a realistic simulation. Nice graphics, fantastic sound. The rally tracks are faithful renderings of real life tracks, same with the cars.
This game is hard. Due to the realism it requires dedication to learn how to drive a rally car. Steering wheel highly recommended, though XBOX controller is still viable.","Dec 1, 2016 at 6:04 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:12:29.466997,Astromax,a bit disappointed,"I played with Dirt3 (not for VR) in the past and I have to say that the graphics was better than in this version. The menu design is more than minimal and uses very ugly textures. Meshes, textures and shaders are really far from the realism achieved on Dirt3.   The game is quite difficult to play even with a steering wheel. Ok Dirt isn't an easy game we all know that but this it really tricky.
As in the other codemasters games force feedback is perfect and the physics two.
I think that codemasters can do better than this so please Update it as soon as possible!
If textures, meshes and menus will be improved the game will be a masterpiece. 
I am waiting!","Nov 25, 2016 at 10:23 PM",3, 5,
