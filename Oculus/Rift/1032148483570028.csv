2022-05-28 15:30:10.222455,kagalive85,More chill than thrill...,"Firstly, the most dissapointing thing about this VR Coaster is the fact that all 3 rollercoasters take place in EXACTLY the same environment - a cityscape that is not very aesthetically pleasing. The coasters are not very unique at all, aside from the fact that they have a few different twists, turns and loops. 

The graphics are not impressive, their is little to no replayability and the entire experience (all 3 coasters) only lasts a few minutes. 

The coasters need to be longer, more unique and take place in different environments in order for this to be a much more entertaining experience.

The only thing keeping this from being a 1 star title is the fact it runs well and didn't seem to suffer from any bugs or crashes. 

TL:DR - Don't bother.","Sep 10, 2020 at 12:22 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:10.238411,TVmachinegun,1 star.,I give this 1 star because there is only 3 roller coasters it is not fun without more roller coasters. Update the game with more roller coasters and I will give this 5 stars.,"Mar 16, 2020 at 10:47 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:10.254368,DaveBowles,Please make this for the Quest2,Love this game/app.  Best coaster experience you can get hands down!  Please make this for the Oculus Quest2!,"Oct 27, 2020 at 6:50 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:30:10.284288,Triskilia,Do NOT buy this!,"I can not believe that I spent money on this crap. Do not buy this! 3 short tracks behind the same boring and ugly background. (Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is prettier than this!). 

The developers have never heard of physics or how a rollercoaster normally drives through curves. You can literally hear and feel your virtual neck break in every turn. x'D 

Where are the promised further tracks? Well ... That the developer's website no longer exists says it all. Maybe that's better.","Jan 23, 2019 at 10:17 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 15:30:13.371032,TeacherAuthor,Thrilling,"The most realistic rollercoaster I have found. It used to terrify me (fear of heights), but mow I am getting a little desensitized. It's still very good though.","Jul 26, 2018 at 2:03 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:30:13.385992,Billebus,Not the best,"It's not terrible, but not the best rollercoaster simulation I've tried. It's very cheap to buy so thats a plus, but it only offers 3 short rides that was not that impressive.","Jul 4, 2018 at 5:50 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 15:30:13.399955,RaDrumba,Yea Not even worth it even on sale.,"Don't get this all you get is three rides and that is all. And even the red rollercoster only had one loop and that about it. 

I've seen a better rollercoaster demo that had 3 rides. And it is free on steam. Get NoLimits 2 instead of this grabage. 

But the only reason Why I rated this as two stars is it got better graphics then NoLimits 2. But NoLimits has better motions sickness then this game.","Dec 22, 2017 at 1:20 PM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 15:30:13.429875,FastLawyer,Not much thrills or chills,"I'm glad I got this on sale, because honestly the rides are very lackluster.  There's only three rides and all three rides have basically the same scenic background of a low resolution city landscape.  The high rise buildings have very low textures and the vehicles are basically boxes with round things to indicate they must be vehicles.  The rides themselves are pretty tame.  Honestly, a forgettable VR experience.  But I think this may be a good VR rollercoaster experience for small children or the elderly, so I will give it two stars instead of one.","Sep 29, 2017 at 2:25 PM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 15:30:16.532577,CatFish21sm,Doesn't work,"Bought the product just for fun but will not start. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, updated, etc still not working. 
I'm runing the latest update of win10 with an intel extreme series CPU, 8 gigs of ddr4 2400ghz RAM and a Geforce GTX 1080ti GPU. 
There is NO reason this game should not run on my computer...
Better yet there is no error message, nothing it doesn't even try to start.","Oct 30, 2017 at 1:51 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 15:30:16.547536,stepan.pazderka,Super short,"It really has only three very short tracks, graphics is bad, too simplistic, not really entertaining in slightest way.","Oct 28, 2017 at 4:35 PM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 15:30:16.576459,Dyslogix,Needs more,"3 tracks is ok, realism is a little off but still for the price it's fine. I would put this above that ultimate booster buggy one by far though, but then companies and game devs are plopping games out like chickens lay eggs, there are bound to be those that are out for a cash grab lol","Jul 21, 2017 at 12:51 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:30:16.591419,Blitzsturm,A Great start,"I had a couple drinks before trying this for the first time which screwed with my sense of balance just enough to make this feel super legit.  The tracks are great, the only downside is how short the total experience is.  But for the price it's perfectly reasonable.  I'd love to see more tracks added on or a bigger experience overall.  I'd be happy to buy more at the same cost per track experience at this quality or better.","Aug 3, 2017 at 12:09 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:30:19.685144,MegaTimX,Nice for beginners,"I got this because it was on sale. It's sale price should be it's regular price. 
The coasters are good, they won't make you too sick. Some other coster games go way overboard with turns. The graphics are okay, not the worst not the best. My only real complaint is that it only has about five minutes of content. Three rides. It was released nine months ago and still only has three tracks all in the same city, despite the developer promising to add more tracks and locations. Did the developer give up on this?","Jun 28, 2017 at 8:02 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:30:19.700104,Bullgear,Very good start!,"The fact that the track is floating in most places makes it feel a bit unrealistic, and I miss the sound of wheels on metal, but nevertheless a very good experience, especialy when VR noobs come over.

2022-05-28 15:30:19.730024,Sneaky4oe,Nice thing. Only 3 tracks tho,"And a bad graphics. Devs could put in some more details and at least add a remote suppirt so you don't have to stare at the selection screen all the time.
Tracks feels nice. And the moving objects (unless they move backwards) adds some feels.","Jun 19, 2017 at 5:58 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:30:19.743987,Demonic420,To short!!!!,Bought this on sale for 99 cents and thats all its worth in its current state literally only 5 mins of gametime.. So devs add more maps or make it so users can create some and this will be A lot better!!!!,"Jun 30, 2017 at 2:35 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 15:30:22.872619,Viper-6,,So far this is the best VR roller coaster I have found. The turns and the red track's loop really hit home. Green and yellow tracks are good but they need more pizazz. Maybe add a corkscrew to yellow track or a loop-de-loop to green. A great roller coaster experience though.,"Mar 5, 2017 at 11:10 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:30:22.902539,Hiro_Protag0nist,Quite Good,"Well i actually bought this when it first hit the store - there were very few coasters around, and it's good.  I'm rather disappointed that the promised new content hasn't happened.","Feb 19, 2017 at 9:37 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:30:26.024190,fuexline,its okay,"well 5 stars for the creativity ive never saw rollercoasters that way, but there is no innovation you ride the three coasters which are in the same town and thats it, its made for sitting experience so well its only a demo to show friends and make them look stunning how vr works but nothing more","Jan 27, 2017 at 12:33 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 15:30:26.054110,Kiksmaler,It would be OK if it was for 1€,"In short, rides are too short and not so thrilling as they could be. This roller coaster experience is fine for a first time in VR and that is it.
Also, there are no controls of any kind, and that is very bad to me, cant stop, cant pause... Too little for this amount of €.","Nov 26, 2016 at 9:39 PM",2, 14,
2022-05-28 15:30:26.068072,Cu5ter,I purchased on a regrettable whim..,"Just don't do it. Sorry devs, I do not mean to be rude but there are better coasters on Cardboard and this does not come close to being worth the asking price. I was done within four minutes and had to supply my own music. It does run well, but the average visuals would explain that. Only three tracks after this long implies only three tracks ever. They also seem to step up in intensity so if three varied rides is what you're after, you won't get them here as only one is much fun.","Dec 9, 2016 at 12:09 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 15:30:26.083032,malerin,"Fair enough, but needs more","Decent enough, but it needs more tracks, or more exciting tracks, or both. Preferably both.","Jan 28, 2017 at 3:21 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 15:30:29.227622,Wrek86,It's okay,"I shouldn't have to say it, but for those that get VR sickness beware, this will be a rough one. My experience with this was mostly boredom. They didn't seem to put much effort into this and the three rides are too similar to even compare them to one another. They did a good job at giving you a sense of height at the beginning, but it seemed they were all on the slow side. I'd suggest making things look a bit more realistic, speed up all three rides especially the red one. I don't feel this game was worth the money. It felt more like a game that you would get for free, which there are several roller coaster games for free out there with better graphics, attention to detail, and speed.","Dec 10, 2016 at 12:17 PM",2, 4,
