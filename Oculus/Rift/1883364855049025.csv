2022-05-28 19:36:22.336813,StephLance,Planets for the apes,"Overpowering and anoying music score. Absolutly no detailing of the planets. Half English, half Japanese. The star field looks like a nitendo game. Controls confusing at best. Feels like a weekend project forgotten on Monday. Froze my computer. Garbage OUT!","Jan 13, 2019 at 6:53 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:36:22.351774,KikiTay,Interesting.. but,"Well the title is misleading. You look at planets that's about it. The controls are confusing and the Engrish is hard understand it look is like not? Anyway a cool experience though, not a game, not a story, not a movie and hardly educational. Still worth a download since it's free.","Oct 25, 2018 at 7:09 PM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 19:36:22.366734,Remmer_G,It's Free,"Well, what can I say about a free app? 

The solar system graphics aren't bad, and you can see what ISS and Hubble look like.

The music is loud, annoying, and not mutable. The constellation names aren't in English, and the word itself is spelled ""constalitions"" in the instructions. I get it, not written by a native English speaker.

You don't get to land on the moon nor walk on it, just teleport around a small area while listening to the astronauts go about planting the flag. The moon graphically is not great.

But, free. So thanks for that!","Aug 12, 2018 at 3:00 PM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 19:36:22.381693,fiomtec,,"Very limited. Constellations named in Japanese? and not configurable. Music not configurable. But hey, it's free. Ask for your money back if you're not happy with it.","Jan 8, 2019 at 11:25 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:36:25.497933,Captain_Howdy,,"not a bad experience, just a misleading title, unless I missed something, I could teleport to the Earth but clicking on the moon did nothing
But hey... it's free so no harm done

I hope the guys at Space Engine will come out with a true VR version/update/upgrade ;)","Dec 13, 2018 at 11:25 PM",3, 2,
