2022-05-28 15:35:04.885336,Gray000022,fun but...,"amzing game, but it really wheres you down. when i get on, i start fine, but i quickly get stuck on puzzles, some puzzles make no sense and i cant find a way through. watching the same deaths over and over get tedious and even skipping them takes its time. it goes slow. 
however, the charicters are very intresting and sometimes make you wonder about them. i also often spend far longer on here than usual and stay up late playing it without meaning to, 
overall it is fun and challenging, it is such a great feeling of sucsess when you beat a level you have been stuck on, in one instance, there is a form of basic mini chess that is simplified, i dont know how to play chess, i was able to pick it up quickly and after a couple of atempts and sleep i found a way to beat the AI, really wish there was some explination of some confusing puzzles though.","Jun 6, 2021 at 12:07 PM",5, 2,

Now, imagine that you are bound to a wheelchair, can’t talk and the other person in the room is a 10 year old girl that you can’t understand. The only way you can communicate is by a laser on the top of your head that is activated by a remote in your hand and nodding your head yes or no. Now, solve puzzles from games like Lights Out, Cut The Rope and Train Maze or die a horrid death. Puzzles range from simple to challenging but not in any particular progressive order. 

The game feels like it was made for Gear VR, Oculus Go or Rift before Touch controllers came out as it only uses the head and 1 button. Though you can wiggle your hands, you are locked in the seated position of the chair. For the most part it works fine, but wears you out after a while, especially after the third round of a board game that you play a couple times. Really wish there was an option to use a laser pointer out of the little remote because looking down at the board game puts a kink in the neck. 

Since the game has multiple endings, it is kind of hard to tell if there is an actual story to the game. Even the beginning, that was more like an intro to the puzzle styles, made the game feel like it was over in about 45 minutes. But there is more and if you want the other endings, you will have to play several puzzle rooms over again.

I love the concept and the fear inducing deaths, but a couple things put me off. Some of Katia’s animations just seemed so slow and clunky, reminded me of old video game characters. Her speed really dragged the board game out longer than it should. The forced head pointing really wore me out, especially since the laser has a time to it, so you have to hold it on some objects to activate the item. This was really evident on the board game as I just wanted to click and move to speed it along. I thought the board game was neat, but as I wanted different endings, I really come to hate that game.","Dec 31, 2019 at 4:04 PM",4, 25,
2022-05-28 15:35:04.915256,ParadiseDecay,A Creepy Escape Room Experience!,"My Initial Impressions:
I don't get to play many escape room style games in VR and I found this to be quite unique and also quite creepy. 
It's amazing how VR can get you SO attached to characters in games

------------------------------------------
It is hard to define what this game is. The central game mechanics is a series of puzzle-solving, but the major catch of this game is the horror factor. You are constantly frightened by what will happen when you push ""that"" button. Definitely not for faint-hearted, but if you are brave enough, you will enjoy the fun of overcoming your fear.","Nov 14, 2019 at 11:29 AM",5, 29,
