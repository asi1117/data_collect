2022-05-28 19:42:21.957133,byteframe,Not bad actually.,"Seems like a series of cheap cell phone vr scares, but they are all well choreopgrahed and varied. Good job.","Jun 7, 2021 at 11:34 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:42:21.972093,FastLawyer,Awesome as a sleep aid,"So if you're having trouble sleeping, then I strongly recommend this app.  There are four experiences and amazingly, they are all pretty dull.  The haunted house is average, could have been much better if they didn't have you going around in circles for no reason.  It's hard to be immersed when you can't figure out why you're floating in circles.  The ocean experience?  Yikes, the graphics are so horrible it's almost laughable.  Well, the drill scene then?  Nah, going to the dentist is scarier.  Surely the spider scene must be scary?  It is the best experience in my opinion.  But it crashed on me and made my Rift go black and it took me a while to figure out that this was not the intended experience since I could still hear the spiders.  That was the biggest scare of all.  When I rebooted the app and tried it again, it was disappointing in comparison to the crash.  At least I only wasted .99 cents and that's why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.","Oct 5, 2017 at 9:11 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 19:42:22.004007,cybernettr,OK for 99 cents,"Graphics aren't nearly up to the level of Face Your Fears or The Forgotten Chamber (which got a lower rating?), but it's worth spending a few minutes with if you can get it on sale.","Jun 27, 2017 at 11:13 AM",2, 0,Thanks for the review.
2022-05-28 19:42:22.018967,getlostguy,not scary at all!!,"boring , it causes nauseas and it is not scary. Please give my $ 99 back","Jun 24, 2017 at 1:38 AM",1, 0,Fear is subjective I understand. What caused your nausia? Also I think Oculus allows a refund of my experience. You have to go through them.

2022-05-28 19:42:25.156614,Zer0Cool0,Really good!,"I went in thinking ""man this isnt gonna scare me"" boy was I wrong. Definitely worth the $2.99, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good jumpscare!","May 21, 2017 at 6:03 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:42:25.171574,Wonzel,"Sorry, I dont get it! Its boring!","I am in the water and see dead people and a ship. Then a ""monster fish"" that apperats more funny comes and eats me. It looks all very bad and boring to me. :-(
Then I am in a chair and a big drill comes in front of my face but the situation is not scary at all. Then I walk around in a big house. Thats in fact the only good part in this ""demo"". Also not really scary but at least not so boring as the other rooms. Maybe in the future there comes more like that then i would give more stars but like that its really not good at all... :-(

OK, what would be really scary in VR to me? I would like a situation where i am a fly and i hang in a spider web. Then the spider comes out of the nest and crawls into my direction. THIS would be scary to me! ;-)","Apr 6, 2017 at 6:30 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 19:42:25.186533,Domitjen,Very interesting concept,"This could become a very interesting pschycological experience for people, if done right. Right now it shows that it's on early access stage, and thats fine, as long as this evolves to the gem it can be.","Mar 20, 2017 at 6:46 AM",4, 3,"Thank you yes its early access, but is clasiffied as a gallery app due to me being a single developer."

2022-05-28 19:42:28.282391,AfterXDeath,A great experience.,"This is a great experience for first time or experienced VR users.
