2022-05-28 17:41:40.528306,Dantheman825,"Wait, this costs money?","This game had been sitting in my library for a few months, so I decided to play through it, and it's pretty well made. it's pretty charming, I love the artstyle, and while there really isn't too much interaction here, there's just enough to where you don't feel like you're just sitting there the whole time. I was gonna give this game I good recommendation, but then I realized that this game is actually $9. Which is baffling because I remember getting this game for free. For an experience that's like 40 minutes long, $9 is a Godawful price, I feel even $5 dollars would still be too much for this. This game is charming, but it's far from being worth it's price",Dec 16 at 10:39 AM,2, 7,
2022-05-28 17:41:40.543266,LindaH416,Should NOT be in the category of puzzles,"Yes the graphics are cool and surreal, the story is cute, but there were only 2 interactive parts that lasted maybe 15 seconds. The rest was just sitting there watching a story. 
Granted, it’s cool but it’s not a puzzle or game AT ALL. 
Luckily some got this for free, but I wouldn’t pay the 10 bucks like I did. Not worth just a cartoon story no matter how good the graphics are in this 30 minute long tale. Frustrating.  
Hard pass.","May 13, 2021 at 2:03 AM",2, 9,

I am absolutely not expecting a free experience to be so overwhelming.. So much work and thoughts put into it. I would gladly pay $9.99 or more for it. In fact, why don't you go ahead and charge it to my account. Excellent job guys, I had goose bumps at the end and even a hint of tears, and I gave you a standing ovation.. Well deserved..

I mean, it was sympathetic, and it has beautiful art and a good message, but the horror was way too much for me. I can never play this again.

Even though the ending showed that everything turned out ok and the scary things could be dealt with — even made to be funny and sweet — the midpoint of the story was an intense experience of being utterly overwhelmed by raw, inhuman evil.","Sep 15, 2020 at 12:17 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 17:41:53.175480,Pierrot777,One of the best VR Cinematic Experiences,"Well, I've just finished it and I'm all tears... If you like action games, etc. do not download it. If you like to experiencie a 40 min. interactive animation movie were you are one of the characters, interacting with this cute little girl, surrounded by  incredible well crafted scenarios, characters and vfx, with a heart braking exquisite soundtrack that makes you cry for moments... Well, then this is for you! 

Now it's one of my top 5 VR experiences togheter with Vader Immortal, First Contact, etc. 

It's not just about all that I said, but about everything mixed in an incredible experience... Just like in a great movie, it's not enough to have well made things: All those things must be created because you need them to build the story, and not the opposite (making a story because you can do great scenaries, fx, etc.)... 

Resuming: This is the way I think a really good VR interactive movie must be.","Mar 26, 2020 at 5:04 AM",5, 10,

I wish there was more to the story and more drawing with the chalk. The chalk, by far, is the best in my opinion.

2022-05-28 17:41:56.388885,SkiddlyWhittler,A true VR Experience,"I have been using my rift for some time  now and tried many different experiences. I truly love vr and have exposed myself to a wide variety of content. I hope that helps give a certain weight when I say that this is something special.

Many of the better titles I have tried translated very well to VR, but often that's kinda the issue. They Translate. Many just use the VR platform as a way to get that extra bit of immersion out of a story that could be told just fine on a screen. They may use full 360, or give you little set pieces to play with the motion controls, but here in  Wolves In the Walls VR is truly leveraged, not translated. 

Wolves in the Walls does a fantastic job of drawing your eyes to where you should be looking when necessary, but also gives you space to look around the world in many spots. More than anything, the world design is absolutely increadible, flipping from the imaginative mind's eye of Lucy to a more grounded world view so seamlesly it's increadible. 

This is probably the most polished, well thought out VR specific experience I have found so far. After years of fantasitc VR content, this is the first that truly brought back the feeling I had when I first put on my headset. Bravo.","Jan 28, 2020 at 1:48 PM",5, 24,

2022-05-28 17:42:02.674075,mdrejhon,No subtitles! Deaf gamer here.,"Hello! Deaf gamer here. I need subtitles. Please?

The best subtitle systems are the ""Republque VR""-style gentle floats, or the ""Red Matter""-style wrist mounted pipboy equivalent.

I wasted money on this game because I didn't know it did not have subtitles.  The Oculus Store does not inform whether a game has subtitles or not.

Oculus Store gets docked 1 star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does. I heard through a friend that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.","Feb 2, 2020 at 6:36 AM",2, 5,

However, the new ending is by far one of the greatest I've seen in VR yet. Lucy was relatable, admirable, and, somehow, one of my friends. Fully immersive, yet simplistic in design, this title threw me into a world i wasnt ready to experience, and gave me an ending i never wanted to come.

I really think this proves beyond doubt that watching 2D TV and movies will one day be a thing of the past. Immersion will only get better and this has to be seen to be understood. 
I've watched animated movies in VR and been impressed, but this is a like a hybrid movie/game. A genuine interactive movie the like of which I didnt think would be possible yet.
Worth paying for, so for free, no brainer as they say.","Feb 22, 2020 at 6:28 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 17:42:05.871522,Scooby-Doo,I Want More (UPDATED),"This is probably one of my favorite short films in VR that I have tried. The interaction and story is amazing. I haven't experienced something like this before. At the end of the film I got kinda sad and wanted to know more and see more. I was striked by the ending, but if it was a different ending I don't think I would have loved it as much. This story adds a mystery and something that gets your heart pumping. I recommend this to anyone who loves animated films/just films. I will be showing this to everyone I know. Thank you very much for making this amazing vr experience.

UPDATE: I AM SOOO THANKFUL! This is what I wanted and MORE! I truly feel as though I am friends with Lucy and felt like it was an adventure with my friend. The gameplay and mystery felt very immersive and I was very happy with the ending. PLEASE make more animations! we need this type of stuff in VR and we rarely get them so I TRULY THANK YOU FOR THAT!!

Rarely have i seen so many new and innovative techniques used all at once. there are times where you put your ear to the wall with a jar to listen, other times you play a vr game in a vr game, and then some visual and virtual space tricks (for instance getting on the floor and looking down through a hatch at a wolf playing the violin in a comical way) that are done flawlessly, wrapped in a story thats heartfelt and blooming with artistry.

I’ve never been so wrong. 

Wolves in the walls is a beautiful experience polished by developers like nothing I’ve played before. You don’t need to shoot, punch or slice enemies here (uhm well, not for the whole time). You will help someone who relies on you in such an intimate way that has left me breathless. Wonderfully drawn environments flow around you as you hold Lucy’s hand, bringing you through the relationships inside a busy family.
Dialogues, voices and musics do create an awesome immersion.
Light is superbly managed creating something unique which stands between oneiric and real.
I completely lost the perception of time, rushing about 1:15h of VR without any interruption.
Oh, and it’s free. 

This is a true gem out of an endless library of reality simulators. I’m looking forward to see more games like this one. Games which leave you with something to think of, and appreciate both the effort of developers and the luxury of letting yourself be amazed of something different from war, action, enemies to fight.
This is about imagination, empathy, friendship. 
And those are the values I would like kids to be taught, not only by parents, but also from games.","Jan 14, 2020 at 6:33 AM",5, 1,

However, it's kinda downhill from there. Everything is solved embarassingly easily and without much suspense or interest. 
As of now, I'd give it 2.5 if I could. Tons of interesting ideas with cool visuals are introduced, and nothing is done with them in the end. 
In my opinion, this is an example of cramming too many good ideas together. If none of them get any focus, all of them feel wasted.","Jan 6, 2020 at 8:52 AM",2, 0,

I never expected such a high level of polish, not only does this have a well crafted story and world, the acting and interactions bring this to a whole new level. For example, Henry is a great VR mini story but I felt much more present in Lucy's home than Henry's home because of the way this mixes passive storytelling with player input. This experience makes me wonder about the amazing future of this technology.

2022-05-28 17:43:56.669179,RuneSR2,VR Movie Art for teenagers and adults,"Did remind me of the quality of Crow, although Wolves in the Walls probably had a much lower budget. The ability to interact and become part of the story is awesome. This is art and replenishes any faith in VR movies in case needed ;) 

The dark story draws you in, and this VR movie is for teenagers and adults, not young kids. Performance was nice, with some dips in the kitchen. The movie feels poorly optimized, I had asw using super-sampling 2.0 more or less constantly, but it mostly felt like 90 fps or close. But beware: the devs aren't joking recommending a GTX 1080, although it's hard to see why you really need more than GTX 970. No Quest for this movie I guess ;)
Colors and sounds were great, really deep SPUD-free blacks and deep bass (also the voice of her father). Congrats to the devs for a great and remarkable achievement!","May 20, 2019 at 4:31 AM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 17:43:56.686133,EddieNanakase,Wow !,"This short film was fantastic !  The story, interactions and mystery draw you in !  Even though it was a short film (with interaction), it felt satisfactory lengthy for me.  This reminds me of the movie "" Coraline "", with it's dark, scary and mystery elements.  It's not crazy scary, it just has a creepy atmosphere.  Out of the other short films, like Crow, Henry, Lost, Colosse, Invasion and so many other VR films, Wolves in the Walls is my favorite !","Jun 17, 2019 at 3:12 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 17:43:56.720042,dragonnyxx,Sets a new standard for VR movies,"I have enjoyed many short VR films such as Lost, Henry, and Allumette. Wolves in the Walls is, quite simply, head and shoulders above all of them.

Not only is a beautifully stylized work which puts you into a gorgeous storybook world, but the many little moments of interactivity - from getting to draw on the walls to helping brew a magic potion - make you an active participant in the world instead of just a passive observer, and the little girl is a touching, well-voiced character you will absolutely fall in love with. This is the sort of experience VR was invented for. It feels like a new kind of storytelling: half movie, half game, and completely wonderful.

The only drawback is that, being only Chapter 1, the story is naturally unfinished and I am desperate to know what happens next. The remaining chapters cannot come soon enough!","May 19, 2019 at 11:16 PM",5, 5,

You really felt like a child, the rooms were warped in a way that makes everything seem like it is twice as long as it actually is.

This interactive film has given me one of the most immersive experiences in VR tried so far. Beyond the excellent drafting of the characters and the remarkable quality of the settings, this experience reveals what is, in my opinion, one of the most exceptional audio managements ever tried in my life, in VR and not. An audio so well balanced that, in one situation over all, I had the most intense immersion in VR experienced so far, to the point that my brain was so deceived as to make me really perceive in that place, not only for the images but also for audio, incredibly tuned to really make you feel there! I'm talking about the scene right after we fight with the sword, while the kid plays TV with the strange VR viewer.
Incredible experience! Superb, beautiful, magnificent!","May 29, 2019 at 9:47 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:44:03.008223,Fredrix,How storytelling in VR should be,"I found the story cute and Lucy's world cozy (more so than frightening). I found everything to be very sharp, and the fact that you could interact with things and follow Lucy's commands made me very invested in the story, and made me immediately leave my chair so that I could move around more freely and kneel if I wanted to. However, the story is short, but it is free so I can only appreciate what I got to experience. But I always wish these kind of Vr-stories were longer. I could easily see myself spending 20 euros on a story like this one which would last between one hour and one hour and a half. At least it seems like there will be more chapters, and I can not wait!","May 27, 2019 at 8:01 PM",5, 0,

After finishing this early access version, I immediately wanted to play through the experience again - not something I've ever had the urge to do with other narrative-driven VR games, even when they've been really good. It's just SO enjoyable and interesting!","May 28, 2019 at 5:40 AM",5, 0,

This is yet another gem one of the very best. I tip my hat to the talent that makes these films it can't be the greatest of audience size or a widely recognised artform but the presentation of animation through medium of VR works so well that it will surely become mainsteam & as important a vehicle for stories as movies, audio & books.

Let's hope that one day in VR, this year's movie becomes next year's gameplay.

I tried things like taking pictures of the NPC, throwing jars at everyone, putting a tail near the NPC's face, and not dropping the blood in the mixture as I was meant to, and two of those four actions did trigger a reaction, althought I'd need a replay to confirm those two reactions weren't simply part of the single default script.

2022-05-28 17:44:06.212653,nightcat.mau,Lucy Should Have Wolves For Parents,"There's clearly something going on that I as an adult picked up on. A year ago something terrible happened, I'm assuming grandma died because all her stuff is in the attic. Well, instead of addressing Lucy's concerns that grandma's diary was right her parents keep reassuring her that there can't be wolves because when they come out of the walls it's all over.

The problem with VR rather than a book is that it's rather hard to stop and explain things like imagination, loss of a loved one, and a child misunderstanding her grandmother's diary. Also, your tiny one will get to fight wolves and see a real wolf attack.

If your child doesn't scare easy and understands the difference between fantasy and reality, great, have at it. But this was clearly a dark kid's book made even more dark and violent for VR. If you haven't covered topics like death, imaginary friends and reality verus fantasy this is hardly the ideal way to start.

Wolves make lovely and nurturing parents btw. They aren't evil nightmare fuel hiding in the walls and they don't dream of eating little kids. If you are going to try this for your little ones keep in mind some positive wolf education.","May 18, 2019 at 6:14 AM",1, 11,
2022-05-28 17:44:06.230605,Squeaks D’Corgeh,Nothing like it.,"I went into this game not really knowing what i was in for. Horror? Mystery? Or just something childish. However, i left the experience just feeling shocked. It started out with credits. Yet somehow they found a way to make it unique. The hands looked like they were drawn. 

Please do not scroll down unless you wish to see spoilers. 

When you begin, the first thing you see is Lucy, the little girl drawing your eyes on. It takes just a few seconds to get to the point. The rest of the game felt just as much as a cartoon as it did reality. By the time we got to the end of the day, i was just focused on the amazing artwork. During the breakdown, dear god it got dark. It was beyond impressive. Flashing in and out, the wolves were absolute nightmare fuel. 10/10 experience. Play it as soon as possible.","May 21, 2019 at 6:50 AM",5, 0,
