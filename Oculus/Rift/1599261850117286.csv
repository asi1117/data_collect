2022-05-28 16:43:27.597615,Megalodon360,Great game for the value!,"I have enjoyed the single player campaign, I will eventually get 100% on it!! I am hoping to try out the multiplayer soon! Great VR title but nothing revolutionary. Reccomend if your looking for something fun for kids or for a value price!","Oct 30, 2020 at 2:39 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 16:43:27.628532,Destructor45acp,Its Ok,"Compared to games like Defence Grid 2 this has a real real long way to go. Not enough tower spots. Enemies advance faster than you can make money to upgrade. You can't pass a level (other than the first 2) without taking some sort of damage.  I look around and see little chests and stuff in the senery, How about being able to find little bonuses by finding things like that? Its early release so I hope for more. It has potential.","Feb 19, 2019 at 5:55 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 16:43:27.642494,xixixao,Pretty but not really exploiting VR,"Ok tower defense, with very slow ramp up, pretty graphics. But why should this be a VR game and not just a standard 3D PC game? Ultimately didn't hook me like other VR titles.","Nov 24, 2018 at 11:54 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 16:43:27.657454,Gudnistark,Wt F in the A. :D :D,"Wt F in the A is wrong with you. The last board. Why are you cheating. I won but the game says draw. But when the game won first then it is defeat for me. I did win. Just because you don't got more boards then you don't have to cheet. But the game is fun. It is a theme in many games, on the last board the game cheats. :D SPOILER ALERT. Guys, if you want to beat the game almost every time then always stack 2 flame towers together, it eats them like cow eating grass.","Jun 25, 2018 at 7:21 AM",5, 6,
