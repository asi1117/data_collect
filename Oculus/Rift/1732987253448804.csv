Greeatings from Brazil!

The app is fantastic, immersive and very powerful. I managed to do some live performances, however, I felt a difficulty.

When I started receiving music requests from my friends, I had no way of knowing how many people were watching or using the live chat, I always had to remove the oculus rift and see the desktop. My suggestion is to have a monitor with the view of the live chat next to the camera control. It would be perfect.

Another suggestion is, have some objects to interact with the public:

Microphone
Champagne
Fireworks
Tennis ball

Having a crowd dancing and the moment you change the mixer fader from A to B the crowd will react.","Apr 14, 2020 at 3:22 AM",5, 15,"Hi DJ Portuga, 

Thanks for your great review and feedback. 

Some of the suggestions you’ve made are already being worked on and will be included in upcoming updates!"

2022-05-28 15:42:59.838007,vtid,6 out of 5 stars.,"I bought this app in December 2017. I've been using a Rift (CV1) for 3 years and this app is in my top 5 favourite VR apps of all-time.

One of many things that amazes me about VR is that you can learn a skill that can actually be applied 1:1 in real life. Having spent all of my life playing musical instruments but also loving dnb/techno/trance etc, the opportunity to learn to DJ for the price of a couple of beers has allowed me to realise that I love mixing as well as producing music. Using this app has lead me to recently purchase real physical equipment (Dj controller/mixer/headphones). I must say that even with the new physical equipment, I still use Vinyl Reality just as much. It's a different experience.  

Also check Vinyl Reality's Discord because it's a great community and the dev is very active on there.","Aug 3, 2019 at 1:04 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:42:59.853965,Ohkult,Really digging it.,"Enjoying the experience so far but I feel it's lacking a few ""Hip Hop friendly"" features. From my experience with using a bunch of turntables and mixers, the requested features below would be more than amazing for Hip Hoppers. There are probably industry terms for what I'm trying to explain, but I'll try my best lol..

1.  A button on the mixer to toggle a reversal of the inputs on the fader e.g - fader to the full left wall of the mixer will cut out your left turntable. Fader to the right will cut out the right turntable.

2.  A button to toggle the fader from actually fading in, e.g - as soon as the fader leaves the wall, the other turntable will play at 100% volume aswell. So essentially it's like a hard entrance or hard exit for each side.

3. When scratching the record, it feels like a belt drive. A setting slider to make it more like a direct drive will give it more torque so when I let go of the record, it has little slack and it plays without the ""wind up"" sound of it not gathering enough speed quick enough.

4. When I'm chirping the beginning of a sample to scratch it IRL, it has abit of leeway, my hand movement can be somewhat wide. But on these virtual decks, it seems like I only need to move my hand the smallest amount and I'm already well past the start of a sample... It's as if the virtual distrubition of the sound around the record isn't spread out enough for a single revolution.. If you know what I mean.

All in all, mixing is fun and it's a solid experience, but I feel like you're missing an entire culture that was birthed with turntables. I'll try and send through these suggestions directly in hope you may consider them. It would really open up this experience to all the Hip Hop vinyl junkies that enjoy turntablism! :)

(I'm also more than happy to help test any changes you might want to make!)

Thanks!","Jan 15, 2019 at 2:48 PM",4, 5,"Hi Ohkult,

Thanks for writing such an extensive and detailed review!

There’s a link to the development roadmap at the top of the Vinyl Reality website, and most of the features you’ve requested (crossfader assign per channel, fader curves and adjustable platter torque) are already on there, so it’s very likely they’ll be implemented some time in the future.

With regards to your 4th point, the turntable’s platter speed is to 45 RPM (so a single revolution contains 1.33 seconds of audio), so it should feel accurate, but I’ll be sure to double check the calculations. Maybe what you’re noticing is caused by controller and audio latency, which for scratching might be an issue that’s not directly solvable.

If you have any additional feedback, be sure to get in touch using the contact section on the website!"
2022-05-28 15:42:59.871917,Uncle_Benny,Perfect for VR,"This is the kind of experience that I think current VR tech is extremely well suited for. You don't need a huge play space, never need to really move from your starting spot, and everything is easily within an arm's reach. I have zero DJ experience but have already had a bunch of fun just messing around with songs in this, and can see myself continuing to do so. I was even able to look up ""real world"" mixing tutorials and apply them in game, very cool. As someone who is into electronic music I have always wondered what exactly DJs do(and I'm sure it is very different with non-vinyl/CDJ setups) it's interesting trying to mix songs together yourself with this title.

Graphics: No frills but everything looks as you expect. I like that there are three environments although it doesn't particularly matter which one you choose. There is a nice feature that lets you pick what ""camera output"" is displayed on your PC screen, could see this being very useful for people who want to do streaming with this title. I appreciate that things just look ""realistic"" and there isn't anything over the top thrown in just for show.

Features: Seems to have most of the basic turntable and mixer functions? As someone not experienced with this stuff, I wouldn't know if anything was missing. Everything does exactly what I would think it does though. I also really appreciate being able to move the table up/down and adjust the angle, was a little low for me at first until I noticed what those levers under the table do. Very simple to move it exactly where you want it.

Controls: Worked great for me. I had one or two issues grabbing new records but that was probably due to rookie errors, for the most part everything was very easy to manipulate in game and didn't have any problems with the turntable or mixer controls themselves. The small feedback you get when manipulating certain things is a nice touch. You almost forget what you're doing, which is a great sign the controls work well.","Dec 28, 2018 at 9:41 PM",5, 6,
