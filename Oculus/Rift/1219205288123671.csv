2022-05-28 16:38:28.951387,Redron357,Quest 2 from Rift,"I purchase your app for my Rift, works great.  I replaced my Rift with a new Quest 2. it is mental to think someone is going to repurchase your app for a newer hardware, but same system (Facebook). I refuse to purchase it again due to newer version of the quest 2 I have. I would like my purchase moved to my lol same Facebook account under my quest 2. BTW I had to replace my rift due to Oculus not supporting the purchase of new Headset cables.",Sep 6 at 5:52 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 16:38:28.966346,Shakagenghis,This is a dazzling puzzler.,"This is a really great title for you puzzlers.  Some are real thinkers.  Turning and zooming are a little slow and clunky, but the aesthetic and challenge of the puzzles makes this a real winner.","Sep 23, 2020 at 8:31 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:38:28.980309,EvilFlow,One of the best puzzle games in VR,"Simple let very fun and rewarding. Great scenery, sound and gameplay. Good options as well. Plenty of levels too.","Apr 7, 2020 at 8:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:38:28.995269,MetaCitizen,Satifying puzzles in VR.,"These puzzles are easily the best I have seen in VR and there are many included. Every 4-5 stages they introduce new mechanics, and while the later stages do become very challenging, they are always very satisfying to solve, even more so when you can use physics or timing to skip intended steps.","Jul 13, 2019 at 5:39 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:38:29.012224,rsiggy,Stunningly beautiful graphics!,"This game reminds me of the old Sierra Switchball game from several years ago, which I loved.  Each level requires you to analyze the marble's path through the level and come up with a strategy to arrange and rearrange game elements properly to get the marble to the finish line.  Levels start trivially easy and get progressively harder as you progress.  The graphics are simply stunning and the soundtrack, contrary to many titles, is a real plus for this one.  

If you're looking for something different that actually requires some thought and analysis to succeed, this game is a great choice.

Developers - please do an expansion pack with more new levels and/or a builders kit so that users can create our own new levels.  Also, I have noticed that after playing this game it seems to change my Win10 font scaling.  For example, after playing this game Outlook 2016 goes back to normal 100% font scaling rather than the 175% scaling factor that is set up as the OS default.  Pretty minor as closing and reopening Outlook solves the problem but it is a minor irritation that should be addressed.","Feb 3, 2019 at 12:02 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 16:38:32.132877,jhall2519,I WOULD give five stars...,"...if this were expandable in any way whatsoever - DLC from the manufacturer, workshop plugin for user-created content...anything!  The puzzles and graphics are very good, the physics believable, but it has only 45 levels and the first 15 go very quickly.  It's a game that gets challenging as you progress, but the fact that there are so few levels is disappointing.  Glad I waited until it was on sale.","Nov 18, 2018 at 10:26 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:38:32.146840,cslos77,,Any kid (or former kid) who likes contraptions and marble courses will enjoy this game. The puzzles start off easy but quickly become challenging and engaging. The game is well polished and the soundtrack is a nice bonus. The main thing missing right now imo is a level designer for users and maybe an online community for users to swap and try out course designs.,"Jan 19, 2018 at 8:11 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 16:38:32.161799,Sakkura,Beautiful puzzler,"Very straightforward puzzle game, but the courses you guide your little marble through are gorgeous.","Apr 4, 2018 at 4:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:38:32.177757,curtwjen,A lot of fun but...,"I've been waiting for this to turn up here on the Oculus store after being released on Steam and it's cheaper here :)

It's as fun as I thought it'd be.  I've always had a facination with marbles, mouse trap, etc.  And this satisfies.

One caution and a word of advice for the Oculus admins.  Don't scare teh potential buyers away with the strict 360 degree warning.  The warning should be something like ""This is playable with a controller but if you are planning to use touch controls then you need a 360 configuration"".

I don't know if that's 100% true but I've been using my Xbox contoller just fine with two (2) sensors.","Dec 23, 2017 at 1:50 AM",4, 16,Hi. MarbleLand is indeed perfectly playable with only two sensors(either with a controller or touch controls). I have updated the store page to reflect this so the warning should have gone away now. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!
2022-05-28 16:38:32.192717,hb300,Beautyful puzzlegame.,A charm... It is magic watching the marbles role. This game is a very nice relaxing experience. Unlimited time and amount of marbles. What you see is beautyful and it never becomes dull. You can aproach the playfield from various angles. The touch controlers are super simple to use. I dont understand the warning from Oculus when you want to buy this game (3 sensors). It works perfect with two sensors.,"Jan 25, 2018 at 4:46 AM",5, 5,
