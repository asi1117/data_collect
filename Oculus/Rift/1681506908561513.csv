2022-05-28 17:29:03.428759,doctor_strangeboi,,"absolutely amazing, not the kind of thing i'd usually read but i was blown away by the experience. its like being in a moving manga, square enix really did it.

watching the panels switch and change and pull out into full scenes is incredible. i can only imagine how good a classic like berserk or akira would be.

its short, its pricey, and it leaves you on a cliffhanger but its worth every penny, the production values are so high and the music is spot on; hoping the format is adopted by more studios because fans will be blown away","Nov 19, 2019 at 3:04 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:29:03.443719,Kazuma2006,Where is the Rest of it?,"I enjoyed every minute, started to like it more towards the end, then it ended. where is the rest??? this would suck so much if ended just here like this. I HOPE they story gets finished, i would like to watch more. maybe you could of run like a season pass for all the chapters?","Nov 16, 2018 at 8:45 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 17:29:03.458679,RikkaKami,Would be 5 star but...,"Cant give it more than 1 because of lenght. 20 euro for 30 minutes is just a joke. If it would be episode 1 out of lets say 10 then it would be worth it. If it would be longer than it would easily be 5 stars since everything is right. It looks beautifull, voice acting is great and story could be actually quite good after what they did in this ""overpriced demo""

If you want to support future of anime/manga vr content go and get Project Lux instead it might be a lil bit more expensive but you at least will get  enought content not to feel scammed.","Oct 10, 2018 at 6:50 AM",1, 14,

2022-05-28 17:29:03.486604,DarkDemon913,Understandable but Unacceptable,"With it being a Square Enix game it is understandable with the price due to the company hiring many people and needing to make money to pay them as well as the associate's and it is very well done which is why i feel the price is inflated. all that being said though i would recommend getting this while on sale since i do not belive the 30 minutes of content it worth the $20 price tag. Again it is very well done and i love Square Enix and understand the price, if you're a fan you will love this but i would wait for sale.","Jun 2, 2018 at 9:51 PM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 17:29:06.623215,Shii,New word in storytelling,"Impressed by way of telling the story. Interactive frames are definetly something new. Movement, voices and sounds creates very deep immersion. Some frames puts you inside manga and allows you to look around. This experience stands between anime and manga and I enjoyed watching it. The only one downside is that story is quite short, want more content for 20$.","Jun 1, 2018 at 7:54 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 17:29:06.639172,zaraion,A great start,"I love SE and almost never fails to disappoint. This experience is incredible. it brings a totally new way to view manga in VR. a good story 5/5 but 4/5 stars because it is short and pricey, but expected for SE. Thank you for the experience and hope to see more like this. (maybe cheaper.)

Also needs an option to resume if you leave.","Jun 5, 2018 at 2:52 PM",4, 10,We are glad you enjoyed the experience! Resume function is something that we will investigate adding support for. Thank you for the feedback.
2022-05-28 17:29:06.653135,yanoty3D,Exceptional,"Tales of Wedding Rings VR has done a fantastic job to ""virtualize"" a manga into an exceptional VR experience. Its use of multiple frames was far more effective than I expected from screenshots. It lets the user experience multiple points of view simultaneously and transits to the next viewpoint in a highly natural way. Music and voice acting are also top notch. Must watch.","Oct 4, 2018 at 6:37 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:29:06.667097,jkred,Exciting blend of Manga/Anime in VR,"Exciting use of VR, blending the medium of Manga and Anime into VR.  Keep up the good work forging a new path in this genre","Aug 24, 2018 at 11:06 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:29:06.682057,KTallguy,Innovative Virtual Comic Book,"Imagine reading a comic book, but being able to peer beyond the frame and look deep inside it. Then, the frame expands around you and enveloping you in a 360 degree scene. Tales of Wedding Rings VR uses these techniques and more to immerse you in a short story. The characters are in full 3D, but move and speak in a way authentic to Japanese Manga and the source material. There are many cool techniques on display: the frames, comic book lines, and text bubbles are innovative and well done.

The only criticism is that I'm pretty tall, and was placed too high in the frame. I needed to find a lower chair and slump down to be at the proper height. It would be great if they added a way to adjust this.","Jun 1, 2018 at 1:07 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 17:29:09.796727,Prophett,"Okay, well, that was Perfect!","I love anime/manga and there is a certain essense to the style of story that can be told in those mediums that I have always thought would be magnified if properly focused through the lens of VR.  This app is a perfect validation of that feeling. 

From a technical perspective, the experience is masterful: The motion capture, voice acting, set design and art and animation direction are flawless, and I don't say that lightly.  The story is also incredibly charming and has that endearing innocence that only anime/manga can capture so well.

All of it comes together into this amazing package that takes what's great about both anime and manga and elevates it into something that feels like the natural and wonderful evolution of both mediums.  There were extended moments where I felt like I was inhabiting the world of a manga/anime and it made me giddy with childish joy.

Well done to the team that made this.  This was mastefully done.  Thank you!","Jun 1, 2018 at 9:52 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:29:09.811691,drewskiidrew2,,Short and a bit pricey but a unique and immersive experience. Unfortunate you canot adjust height so that you can feel like you are standing right there with the characters but other than that i feel like this genre of VR should definitely be expanded on.,"Jun 7, 2018 at 2:31 PM",4, 7,"Thank you for the feedback. We are looking at the height issue to see if a solution can be provided in an update. In the meantime, as a stop gap remedy, we recommend to try a lower chair."

2022-05-28 17:29:09.868535,Shelim23,,I was expecting a great experience because its Square Enix which made all those great FF Games I used to play and also a friend Rawle gave it 5 stars with an amazing comment (Rawle smh) but I was absolutely disappointed the Music was great but the content was super short and mediocre 30 minutes and its over what a waste of money I had better experiences from other free content in VR. This is definitely not worth the price.,"Jun 3, 2018 at 7:58 AM",2, 5,
