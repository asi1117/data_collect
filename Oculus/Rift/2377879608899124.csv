But that's with the Rift CV1, not the Index, and I tested both (Index using Revive). Not sure what happened with the Index, I didn't feel the 3D perspective was correct - or maybe it was because of the lcd grays - or I was having some sort of bad day, lol. 
Now Claustral Canyon is a dark place, close to pitch black a few places, and it's awesome with the CV1, it looked totally black but without the spud (oled mura) appearing - the oled blacks totally shine. And the perspective was perfect - I felt presence in the Canyon, which I did not with the Index. I used super sampling (ss) 2.0 with the Rift CV1 and got solid 90 fps with my oc'ed GTX 1080, simply perfect (ss 2.0 is 21 mill pixels per image). 
The devs say it's just a small part of the Canyon, but it's like 5 times bigger than Flume Gorge. I travelled through the entire Canyon today, and loading new scenes happened like 4 or 5 times. Even using a fast SSD, loading times were similar to loading a level in Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond, but Claustral Canyon is 32GB and may take some time to load using a HDD. I just checked my SSD, Flume Gorge takes up 4GB of space, while Claustral Canyon takes up 32.3GB - that's 50% of Alyx ;) 

Again I get the feeling that you cannot just have one hmd these days - you need both oled and lcd. While Flume Gorge totally wins using Index res 200% (lcd), Claustral Canyon wins hands down using CV1 ss 2.0. 

By an error I got charged twice for this app, but I'm not complaining - Oculus or the devs fully deserve that I pay twice for this app. I might even pay 5 times it's current price if devs wanted that. It's simply that good. I'm thankful for the devs for showing me such an awesome place that I would probably never get to see in the real world.

Btw, controls are great - the devs should not change anything. Controls are similar to Flume Gorge, you primarily just look where you want to go.","Feb 3, 2021 at 6:10 AM",5, 3,

Excellent Project.

Any plans to extend it?


I would suggest, a few little interface options.

1).  Menu Button - options, settings, and end/exit
2).  Possible to add a Location map?
3).  Seperate Volume levels for
      a). Voice,
      b). Music,
      c). Ambient.
4).  Perhaps some video tweeking options.

Very well done!

I do not hesitate to recommend this!","Dec 5, 2019 at 1:19 AM",5, 16,
