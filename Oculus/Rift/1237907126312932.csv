2022-05-28 16:33:05.850565,ShocksVR,Pure Magic - a unique experience,"Played on both Quest and Rift. A surreal, magical experience for all ages - kids and adults alike. It's short, but worth your time. There's also endgame content of returning back to your garden and further caring and harvesting your plants; customizing your garden.",Jan 8 at 4:02 AM,5, 18,
2022-05-28 16:33:05.864528,synapse03,Wonderful VR in imaginative world,"At first, I thought Fujii might be too cartoonish, but the detail of this colorful world, the sounds, characters, and music will really transport you out of the humdrum life.  I find the experience can be very therapeutic as you grow and nurture your colorful, alien garden.  The animation is smooth and first-rate, and makes you want to explore.  Fuijii will grow on you.",Sep 23 at 7:50 AM,5, 16,

2022-05-28 16:33:05.911402,Pan_Daemonium,Wonderfully cute and relaxing,"This was one of the first games I bought on my Rift S, and it's given me hours of fun. The game incorporates two main elements: The garden itself, and the environments you visit to get more seeds to beautify the garden. Fujii incorporates simple puzzles and an exploration element in really beautiful surroundings, with well-composed music and SFX, and intuitive controls. 

For such a simple game, it keeps me coming back, because there are still places I know I haven't visited, and it's a really relaxing world to be in. Sometimes I pop in there just to chill out - you can even have fun spending a while the garden (which functions as the 'hub' level) and not bothering to explore at all, for a while, it's so pretty :) 

I'll recommend this to friends, and it was well worth the eleven quid I spent on it. Looking forward to seeing more from the developers.","Aug 3, 2020 at 8:58 AM",5, 36,
2022-05-28 16:33:09.028067,glitterguns,So Cute!,"This is a nice, mindful, colorful, explorative game. I gave it four stars because I wish it were longer or had more objectives to complete. Hope to see something more immersive soon!","Oct 10, 2020 at 10:58 PM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 16:33:09.043026,Sanborn,Weird musical plant puzzler relaxation,"This game is simply lovely, this is what I enjoy most out of VR. This game is just all about exploration and taking in the envirionments. I've got 57 minutes in, and this game is a definite keeper that I think everyone needs to check out.

The gameplay is moving from area to area, solving plant interation puzzles that further unlock zones. Along the way you collect seeds and little energy balls. The Energy balls are required for gates, and the seeds you take back home to plant in your garden.

This game is weird, in all of the best ways. It's so enjoyable to solve an area to uncover a seed youv'e never seen before. You have no idea what the seed does, but I can promise you'll enjoy whatever it is.

I was completely zen after my 2 play sessions, the music and art in this game is so relaxing.","Jun 28, 2019 at 11:42 AM",5, 33,
2022-05-28 16:33:09.056989,Raunhofer,Relaxing,"A beautiful wandering game that is both touching yet exciting. The gameplay is solid, graphics are good and sound design is awesome. My only complain is that for 15 bucks it should be a tad longer (-1 star).

Oh, and I made a new friend while playing the game. Some sort of space potato. He/she's great. prrrrptttpt!","Jul 6, 2019 at 9:36 PM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 16:33:09.071949,swanijam,The absolute chillest thing,"Fujii reminds me a lot of GNOG in the way that it's sparkles and colors and sounds put you in a constant state of peace and awe, and you get all wide-eyed and do a lil gasp every time you poke something. You're so ready for everything to be energetic and adorable and when the plant pal pulls out a plant banjo you do a very loud and happy shout because holy cow, wowee, oh goodness, he's really doing that and he's very talented, what a champ, and absolute delight of a guy. 10/10 this is what VR is for","Jul 2, 2019 at 10:40 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 16:33:09.085912,iXichi,Charming!,"This is hands down the most relaxing charming game I have played in VR.
