The turret is terrible trying to swing it around and completely breaks immersion knowing that your two hands arent in this fixed postion that it wants you use. Even just a ""floating"" two handed cannon would've been a decent option, but trying to swivel the gun around with a constant ""shoot from the hip"" feel doesn't work well.",Jan 13 at 12:25 AM,1, 35,"Hey kiddocannon, I'm so sorry you had such a bad experience with the controls! It sounds like maybe the turret was too far away or the height slider was too low - we need to do a MUCH better job of making that intuitive. Really sorry you had a bad time.

We do have a ""floating"" version of the turret that perhaps we should add as an option as well.

Thanks for your feedback!"
