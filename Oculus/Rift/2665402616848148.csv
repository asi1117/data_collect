2022-05-28 20:43:59.567311,arios018,Great Game! Just one little thing...,"Can we have both DUAL GUN and FREE LOCOMOTION at the same time? May seem like a minor detail but well worth the wait if it could be accomplished. 

One of my fav games for sure. 

Thanks devs! \m/,",Nov 26 at 9:36 AM,4, 4,

2022-05-28 20:43:59.614185,ernestoyaquello,Super fun retro shooter,"This game is like a cool shooting game of an arcade machine, but in VR. You can ignore its arcade vibes and choose the free-locomotion mode, but I would recommend the arcade mode (which restricts your positions to certain points of the map), as it makes the game more challenging and allows you to focus mostly on the shooting.

In general, this game looks pretty cool and is great fun, both for the shooting (which feels very satisfying) and for the dodging of enemy bullets. Even when restricted to a certain position, you can still move your body to hide behind obstacles, which makes the whole experience much more interesting and realistic. And reloading is kinda cool too, although, like some other things, it could do with some improvement:

* Reloading is kinda satisfying, but it feels slightly off. I wish we were forced to do it with two different actions, one to remove the previous magazine, and another one to introduce the new one. It would feel much more natural.
* Reloading can be difficult in the last map, as the lack of light doesn't allow you to see your gun.
* Your empty hand seems too eager to move to the top of the gun, which sometimes causes you to unlock it when you are trying to reload it.
* I would like to be able to hold the guns with both hands, especially the big ones.
* The map where you are a snipper can be frustrating. First, if you accidentally move the gun too close to your face, you stop seeing through the lens, losing the context of what's happening. Second, it is very easy to fail the mission, and trying to figure out why you have failed it can be kinda confusing. It is a cool idea, but the execution could be better, in my opinion.
* The level where you drive is very fun, but I think you could suggest to the user that they sit down to play while driving, as it doesn't really make sense to drive standing up.

Despite all of this, as I said, the game looks amazing and is pretty fun, so I would definitely recommend it!","Oct 31, 2020 at 6:23 PM",4, 13,"We are very excited to see your detailed and in-depth reply! The problem you reflected is indeed a problem that everyone talks about. You mentioned quite a lot of problems in the operation of reloading. We will try to optimize it in future updates. We have tried grip gun with two hands,for users with some auxiliary equipment, such as the handle bracket, it will indeed have a better experience, but for some players with worse shooting ability, the grip with both hands may confuse them and hard to aim. SILICON RISING game with very high action elements. Players are shooting in multiple directions almost at any time. If you use your two hands to control weapons, it will be quite difficult to aim. Maybe we should provide options for players to choose whether to use both hands. Sniper level has always been worried that players will feel it a little difficult, even when we are doing internal testing,too.We hope to hear more of your feedback, and polish this content smoother. Indeed, the driving level is more suitable for sitting and playing. The game's settings also provide the option of sitting playing. Adding a hint really helps guide players to sit and play in this level. Thank you for your suggestions."
2022-05-28 20:43:59.628148,FreshBobo,Surprised gems！,"This game is definitely a Gems.  Watching the trailer,I thought it was a cyberpunk 2077 VR version, but it was not like that.  The design idea of ​​this game is very retro, even very different from most current games. It has arcade mode and free locomotion mode, yes, supports free movement.  But I am very curious about the arcade mode, arcade?  Are you kidding.  In fact, this is a real arcade mode. In this mode, you cannot move freely, but you can move your body within a certain range to achieve the purpose of movement. The gameplay in this mode feels very like an ancient light gun game, and  This kind of gameplay is brought to a whole new level in VR mode.  In comparison, the free-movement mode is unremarkable.  To be honest, the sound effects of the game are terrible. Does the production team want to make the sound feel retro,too?  It has a story, but from the performance to the lines, everything is embarrassing.  At the moment, I have reached the second stage,which is a sniper level. From the trailer, it seems that there is a driving level behind. I look forward to the content behind.  By the way, I hope I can use double guns in arcade mode, otherwise my left hand seems to have nowhere to rest.","Oct 30, 2020 at 9:58 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:44:02.749799,jakenut86,Great game!,"Really enjoyed this! The final battle was a bit tough but definitely worth it, hopefully that ending means more to come in the future! Great job on this devs!","Jan 13, 2021 at 9:18 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:44:02.764759,Zizi_Zi,Gorgeous and restless cyberpunk tour!,"The  cutscene part of the game was terrible, stiff and awkward, unlike the game of this era.  Played to the third level, the mode is quite rich, the stage actually has two different ways of playing the same level: free locomotion and arcade mode.  The arcade mode is very similar to the old light gun game, but the frequent reload require is very annoying,better to simply reload the gun with click button.  
The sniper level gave me a huge surprise.  The core gameplay is to avoid big bullets fired by the enemy. At first, I didn't understand it. After I figured it out, it was really a magical touch. It felt like a somatosensory game.  After the game reaches the third level, the difficulty is quite large. The advantages and disadvantages of this game are quite obvious, which needs to be improved.  Well, I will continue to challenge!","Oct 31, 2020 at 12:06 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:44:02.780716,B1llGallagher,not loading????,"on the 3rd reload will not let me launch game until i get up and running will adjust review then, all working now and worth the wait for it happy customer.","Feb 21, 2021 at 2:18 PM",4, 0,"Hi B1llGallagher, sorry for the unpleasant experience.

PS Problem fixed. Nice game!","Oct 31, 2020 at 1:41 AM",4, 6,"Hi Vlad_D, sorry for the inconvenience! When we saw your review, we checked and repaired our game system immediately, now the game is able to launch. But unfortunately we find out there has a bug which affected the leaderboard function, the ranks may missing ( after many investigations and tests, our preliminary judgment may be caused by the SDK update of the platform system). Even this bug would not influence any gaming experience, but we still attach great importance to every detail. Now we are communicating with platform to ensure that function restored as soon as possible, hope you can give us the opportunity to bring a better game experience to you."
2022-05-28 20:44:02.810636,steeeeeeeeeee,Connection Interrupted,"I am seeing the same connection interrupted issue as reported below... is there a fix for this?

Update: After a couple of days & a windows update the game just started working. I suspect from the dev responses to this issue on other comments that it has nothing to do with anything I have done but the stability of the services the game is trying to connect to. Until they address that it seems like its going to be a recurring issue. More info from the devs would be helpful here. As for the game itself, I have not played much so far but visually it looks great.","Dec 6, 2020 at 8:24 PM",3, 1,"Hi steeeeeeeeeee, I'm very sorry because we brought you a bad experience, we have solved this problem. I hope you can launch game again, it will bring you a different experience. And, we very much hope to hear your suggestions or comments, thank you!"
