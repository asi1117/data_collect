Good maps/scenarios really making you move, look up, down and around and find cover (in the real world give yourself space :p ), reasonably difficult (I started on hard but had to relent after a while : ) ), good characterisation, good story, immersive.",16 days ago,5, 3,

2022-05-28 20:33:06.528724,MuffinFerret,Great game not for everyone,"please just dont base this game on the reviews, i suggest you actually watch some videos about it or actually buy it and see for yourself. 
its a really great game, yes it was lacking in some departments but it was gold in other. 
would highly suggest, and also its great they added feature that you can skip sequences that have chance of making you motion sick, but dont skip those they are great if you dont get easily motion sick ofcourse, this is kind of a must have even if you dont like FPS or WWII themed games its still great experience with gallery/documentary that is enjoyable and also adds to the game and makes you feel into it.
again i highly suggest! great game",Feb 10 at 1:09 AM,5, 10,
2022-05-28 20:33:09.659469,Stewcumber,A very good VR FPS experience,"MoH gets the core gameplay loop pretty much nailed - excellent gunplay with visceral reloading and the best implementation of two-handed aiming I've seen in VR.

The tone is quite light-hearted. Lots of reviews mentioned an inconsistent tone, but in my opinion it's pretty lighthearted all the way through; the game does not try to be serious outside of The Gallery videos, and it succeeds at being a ""fun"" game in an era of gritty, emotional, politically charged games.

Aiming with two-handed guns is a case of easy to learn and hard to master. It is very rewarding once you get your eye in with certain guns, looking down their sights, but at first you'll likely dislike it and die a lot. The Thompson is the exception to this as I never really got it to work, and I'd also liked the pistols to be a bit more powerful. Snipers however are great, in the ""use the sights realistically"" mode anyway. I loved pulling a scope up to my eye and actually holding my breath to take a shot with steady arms.

The graphics are jaw-dropping - not quite as good as Half Life, but the environments are greater in scale. The interactivity is ""average"" for a VR game; you can pick stuff up but not do much with it.

The sound track is pretty good and has a good few nods to Allied Assault if you happen to remember that after 20 years (or have re-played it recently like I have). In fact, the missions are quite reminiscent of Allied Assualt.

Where the game is weaker is the too frequent cutscenes bringing the game's pacing to a screeching halt - whether this a technical limitation or a developer's tactic to manage nausia / discomfort, I don't know, but especially in the first half of the game you're on the leash a little too much - 3 minutes of in-game cutscene, 5 minutes of walking and shooting, repeat. It improves a lot later in the game.

Also, the enemy AI soldiers have a little too much health and are a little too accurate making for some cheap feeling deaths.

2022-05-28 20:33:09.675426,BillBoss2008,unforgettable,"The game is short but it doesn't matter for something this great and quite long. all the reviews talking about scale aren't wrong but unless you know a lot about ww2 stuff it won't be a problem. Charecters are engaging and funny. tone is a bit wacky and unclear during levels. there was a lack of setting to change, like turning off turning and you can't have the charecters speak diffrent launges with out changing the games launge. levels are quite realistic. guns are a bit big for my liking but it isn't to bad. the trailer is not much like the game but you can still play it like the trailer and it seems to have little touches that make it a little better. multipyer is dead though. game overall is very fun and will show you not exactly what it was like back in ww2 but is definetly realistic enough to teach people about guns from ww2 and some of the things nazis do that people don't talk about much. game includes the navy air force and of course the army. the gun play isn't the best but its better than arizona sunshine but not as good as pavlov. if you want a ww2 game this is probably one of the best picks you could get. This game also paves the road for more games like it in the ww2 genre.",Mar 7 at 11:03 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:33:09.690386,FutureShock_,Bland and last-gen,"Pros: 

- The map design is good in places, as is the colour palette. 
- The campaign is quite long for a modern game, especially a VR one.
- There are some funny situations, decent one-liners, and lots of camp.

Cons: 

- Tonally inconsistent. Is this a comedy? An homage? A parody? A gritty war epic? The campaign is never believable, gripping or emotionally resonant. 
- It goes out of its way to include Omaha beach and the Western Front when it doesn't even make sense. This setting is already done to death.
- The game handholds a lot.
- Many levels play like linear shooting galleries.
- The weapon and interaction mechanics aren't the worst I've seen but I like to separate VR games into pre-Alyx and post-Alyx, and MOH:AA is VERY much in the pre-Alyx category. You always have to fully reload weapons even if you have a round in the chamber and you don't insert magazines, you move them into an invisible box and let them go with slight delay (yuck). 
- The sound effects and weapon effects aren't realistic.  
- The scale of the levels is wrong, with most objects being unrealistically large (including a Sherman tank that is 20ft high). 
- The NPCs are deep in the uncanny valley. 
- The performance is a mess. I spent a lot of time tinkering on my 2080 Super / Ryzen 5 5600x and there are quite a few framedrops in the campaign despite the game looking very aliased. Much better looking games (Alyx) demand much less of my hardware. I actually bought this game a year ago for different hardware and refunded it, there hasn't been much change since then.
- The install space is 180GB(!). This is the biggest VR game I know of three times over and it's far from being the best looking or most detailed. 
- The AI is atrocious and mostly just runs at the player. The animation transitions are broken so deaths look weird and there's lots of enemies clipping into walls or teleporting into existence as you enter the room. 
- The multiplayer is dead on PC, not sure how good it is.",Nov 15 at 1:17 PM,3, 78,
2022-05-28 20:33:09.705346,storm.2.exe,Worst VR game i've played,"Medal of Honor is a WWII shooting game where you take place as an American lieuteninent who joins a team called the OSS and fights nazi soldiers.

Pros: Graphics are done well, and the weapons are satisfying to use.

Cons: The game breaks my computer. On Task Manager, it said it was using 3000 megabytes of memory. It takes 10 minutes for it to even start, and even more for it to load. Sometimes it doesnt even start at all. In the chance that you actually get to play, its extremely laggy and the game is interuppted by many cutscenes and it kind of ruins your immersion plus its annoying. Gameplay is...fine I guess? It's last gen and not the best effort was put into it. I did not like how this game made their final product, I feel like the game should be a bit more like the games Boneworks, Blade and Sorcery, Hard Bullet: VR The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, Defector VR, LA: Noir and Half-Life: Alyx. In my time of VR I have never come across a game so bad as this.

Graphics: 9/10

2022-05-28 20:33:12.823114,shaned32,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this game. I loved the ps2 and psp Medal of Honor games and even the 2010 reboot. I was expecting a somewhat grounded and serious campaign, but instead got an average action-adventure comedy. Gunplay is anything special, not the best but not the worst. There’s a good amount of weapons and objects to interact with but sadly there’s no impressive physics that you’d expected from a single player action game (like Alyx, Walking Dead, or Boneworks). Multiplayer was also completely dead, Ive never been able to find an online match. 
I’d recommend waiting for a good sale.",Nov 15 at 11:03 AM,3, 16,
2022-05-28 20:33:12.839072,henrystrong,Such and amazing game!,"I saw quite mixed reviews of this when it first came out. I didn’t have any issue with the game at all and absolutely loved it! It literally felt like I was in an Indiana jones movie. I can not recommend this enough! Plus all of the details in the game as just crazy, its easy on the level of HL Alyx.
Only one small gripe is the sniper scopes are a bit terrible, it’s like having a screen 2 inches away from your face forcing you to stretch your arm out to view the 'scope' removing all accuracy.
Also what is amazing, is how long the story is, I was really suprised and thought for the money its really worth it considering most VR story based games are half the length of this. Anyway give it a blast its absolutely worth it!",Nov 8 at 1:56 AM,5, 25,

I had to jump through all kinds of hoops to get this game running respectfully enough to  play through.  After finally finding a set of settings that worked at 90fps consistantly, after about 20 minutes, the game starts tearing and stuttering constantly.  Restarting the game fixes it, but im not restarting it every 20 minutes.

Checking my system during gameplay, nothing changes between minute 10 and minute 20, there doesn't appear to be a memory leak, but the jittering starts no matter way.  Either using wired link, air link or VD, it always happens and ONLY happens with this game.

I will go over the pros and cons. Also be aware there are a few bugs that ruin the immersion a little bit but you can over look them as im sure they will patch stuff up eventually. EDIT: ( They never really did ) 

Pros:
Gun mechanics are pretty good i was expecting much worse mechanics almost inline with onward and pavlov (Please let us reload blotactions how they should!)
Graphics are REALLY good
got some cool extras
mechanics are solid
seems to be a descent amount of content
map quality is really nice
The multiplayer is not great, the bots are not very good, they need smoother animations It looks basic.
Cons:
$60 is too much please make it $30-$40 Its a medal of honor game so i had no problem spending the 60 on it lol just doesnt feel like $60
The acting seems more cheesy than the ones from back then but i can kinda overlook it.
Seems like they tried to give it a more ""arcade"" feel wich im not a huge fan of, its not as ""grity"" as the originals.
Random cuts fading to black is annoying the crap out of me. Please just have it so the player walks up and they do their animations/dialog 
For a rated M game i have yet to see anything make it rated M. Besides the one part where he says the F word like 30 times in a row and thats it.
The guns can go through walls and i would like them to be able to interact with the walls/objects around so it adds immersion.
As much as i love blood and gore, i feel the blood is way to big and exagerated needs to be like half size, an added puff of smoke and loose fabrick to the front and back would be REALLY nice.
Please add gore/dismember if its going to be rated M guys come on
EDIT: Unfortunatly they have not really updated this :(",Jul 10 at 6:58 AM,3, 20,
2022-05-28 20:33:22.391089,ImmersiveGamer83,Really enjoying the game.,"I have recently watched through WW2 in colour and whilst this is a hollywood rendition of the war It is still amazing to see really beautiful authentic feeling environments. The vehicles look so good, Standing next to an American Bird in the hanger was awe inspiring only to find that you actually get to fly as a crew member, yes it was quick but again the polished assets are beautiful . I am still only a few levels in and it is starting to feel like a medal of honor game now. 

The main thing that could improve this is more visual options and settings. It really is bare bones!!!!!!! For this reason I use virtual desk top for wireless vr instead of air link as there is more control over pallet there. 

I think there is work needed for the gun play. Iron sights is not quite right to me. I struggled playing on normal and I am not bad at VR shooters but struggled to get used to how everything works. It is very different to onward and pavlov and not in a good way. 

I really enjoy single player story campaigns so am more than willing to overlook some of the short falls. I do not know how the multiplayer is yet but I read that it got off to a bad start but will check it out at some point. I remember back in the day playing MOH rising sun and hope there is bots because I had a lot of fun playing with a friend against bots. 

180 gb space on hard drive is hard to swallow but I am not struggling for space so is no biggy to me. 

It is a massive shame that this game got bad press as I do not think we will see another VR title from respawn which is a amassive shame. I hope EA pump some money into making VR in the future",Aug 12 at 6:55 AM,5, 6,

After 5 months on VR I still find this game really enjoyable to play, and despite having quite a few other games, keep coming back to MOH. I really don't understand what people are complaining about.

2022-05-28 20:33:25.511358,Marirari89,"Not perfect, but a very enjoyable game!","Despite its flaws I really, really loved this game! It was most likely rushed to release too soon, and I hope the developers get to polish it more through some good updates based on community feedback. It is really sad to think that I almost skipped this game because of the mixed reviews. 

The good: 
I ran the game without any crashes or any big issues on an RX5700XT GPU and Ryzen 7 3700X CPU. 

This is a big VR-game where you get a lot of game for your money, while many other VR-games are mostly very short and limited experiences. You get a campaign that takes about 10 hours to beat, a survival mode to sink hours 
into, multiplayer and a great gallery with really good movies to watch, as well as 360 degrees VR videos of important places in WW2. The campaign has a lot of different locations and different types of gameplay.

This game has some of the most beautiful environments I have ever seen in VR. Extremely immersive at times when the environments look so stunning and you see tanks roll around and planes fly above your head. You really feel the environments are real when you can look far into the distance. Great sound effects for guns as well. Faces mostly look great. The campaign and story is a little over the top and silly, but still great fun! 

The bad:
Enemy AI needs a proper overhaul. Guards often stand for a second after being shot, and fire at a wall if your on the other side of the wall, or fire at the ground
if you are below them. Sizes of characters feels off. My in game hands are way too big. 

I also feel it should be possible to manually reload 100% with all weapons. It is very weird that you can press a button to reload the shotgun. Aiming with your head to use turrets is weird. They need to finish the weapons and have the same level of detail and polish. You should not be locked in place during cutscenes, but be able to walk around. History-buffs like me would love interact with old things while characters talk.","Jun 3, 2021 at 11:23 PM",4, 102,

2022-05-28 20:33:28.667531,adrien914,"The game is very fun, but disappointing","Let me explain why it was disappointing to me.
I recommend this game without a doubt, but for its price it should've had more polish.
The graphics are stunning, the gunplay is smooth ( even though the reload mechanics are a bit weird but it still works decently well ), the sound design is great, the voice acting is great, the story is decent ( it feels like old school MH but these games never had a great story ), the ambience is really good too, so why was i disappointed ?
Well, the physics are basically non-existent, for a game that's as expensive as Half Life Alyx and developped by such a big studio you would expect it to have at least basic physics.
The mission pacing is bizarre, some missions are literally 30seconds long and then you get a loading screen and some others are 10-30mins long.
The multiplayer is dead, i usually wouldn't blame a VR game for how much players are playing because there isn't too many people who play VR yet but it's mainly due to the pricing of the game so it's their fault.
I still recommend it as it's a fun game.","May 30, 2021 at 12:28 AM",3, 22,

It is immense, with just over 171gb no-one should ever complain about the price with the packed content they have worked on.
No other game in VR lets you stand by a aircraft/U- Boat etc, and look at the detail like we never could of many years ago.
The graphics are excellent (oculus rift s and 3080) with the original soundtrack spurring you on through the fighting.
These games are really what VR is made for, true immersion of things we lost in time or experience.
I hope this is a start of many more MOH and/or similar games for the future.","May 10, 2021 at 3:14 AM",5, 21,

They implement so many things you almost never see in games like watching the gustav railway gun upclose and seeing it fire or using a turret to shoot planes and even shoot in tanks! i would tell you more but i dont want to spoil it but ill just hint it and say, there are soem scenes which A: make you feel like your actally doing the thing and B: Use these scenes to make you feel exited and rushing with joy and sometimes to can be touching too. keep in mind i think the price can be dropped a bit but with the amount of replayability and playtime its worth every penny. Great visuals from a semi decent pc, amazing never seen before scenes, imersive gameplay, easy to use weapons and reloading to help you in tough situations, the list just goes on but my only complaint is that the game kinda loads alot, what i mean by that is that the games segments are kind of short and you get a loading screen every 7-15 mins but it was probaably done to make it run alot more smoothly so i have no issue with it. so over all 10/10 game and would recomend it to you if you love ww2 history, action and vr!","Apr 10, 2021 at 3:44 AM",5, 20,

Pros-
-Story seems really good so far
-great visuals
-good balance of run and gun and sometimes gotta slow down and hit ur shots
-feels like a medal of honor (witch i love lol)

before i list cons just gonna say im better at nit pickin lol

cons
-held items can go thrue the enviornment (hate this in vr but very common so take that how you will.
-barely manual reloads ( i love a shooter that makes me feel like im loading the gun on my own).
-must shoot with ur main hand( no duel wealding lol)
- gun play can really bring down the imersiveness at times
- the biigest one for me was how they store all item on ur person. i think they could have taken a big hint from Onward when it comes to on player items. im about to go on a rant for this so bare with me lol. if u have a syringe(witch are really needed to survive) they go on ur off hand wrist and just looks terrible. explosives are too cloes to ur face but their ""on"" ur chest, some guns that you hold with two hands will force you to holster them if u let go of the grip. and the other buzz kill is you can grab item really far from ur character but if items are next to each other its hard to grabe the one you want.

so i think its a fun game but i wouldnt spend more then 20 MAYBE 30 on this game no way in hell i would have paid 60 if i knew this but cant say i regret it to much.

When beginning the tutorial you see these gorgeous characters but with a dead-stare in their eyes. And they're not even looking at you. Such a waste of the character model, again a beginners fault. Then the controls, the gun is on your hip, but I can stretch my arms completly forward and still grab the gun. These invisible detection-orbs around the ""storage slots"" on your body are like 400, maybe 500% to big. They're so big, that at least 5 out 10 times you want to grab something of a table or the floor, you grab your gun instead. Not a beginnersfault, absolutely ridiculous.  The reloading controls are a pinch better, but still way to foriveable. I can reload the gun without even touching it. Extremely arcadey..  
I really wanted to opose all the hate this game got, but unfortunately, the beginning of this game didn't help.. All the other critique was just as correct, the frequent loadingscreens, the first levels are so static, so small, I felt tied down, so un-vr like..  It honestly felt like respawn-team played in VR for the very first time.. 
But I paid for this game, and I was going to finish it. Luckily I did. 

The above is all true, but in settings menu you can adjust just a smudge in the more experienced vr-gamer direction. I disabled all the ""highlight selected objects"" and stuff like that. And those mega-acardey controls of reloading, I kind of ignored them slowly throughout the game. I found myself reloading like you do in Pavlov or onward, and ignored the fact that game didn't need that. 
And each level you progress, the levels became bigger, and more beautifull. I felt the respawn team was learning quickly. About halfway through, the game started to feel better. To the point where I was actually enjoying myself. And the second half only made it better. I think respawn has learned a lot, and I was there as a witness.

After spending 10 hours in the game I simply don't understand any of the bad reviews. This game feels extremely polished, I get completely perfect 90 fps using max visual in-game details (haven't patched the game), never had better tracking or feeling of holding a weapon before (Boneworks is so much worse), voices and sounds are just perfect too - and I'm really close to having an Alyx class experience. Seriously.
Textures are awesome, just look at your hands - and there're no jaggies - fantastic image quality. No texture popping. Love how you can deform walls when you shoot at them. Love throwing the grenades - but have to watch my ceiling in the real world. Controllers work flawlessly.  
There's simply no way I can get better performance even with a RTX 3090 - because I get perfect 90 fps constantly as written. 
For textures and artwork this is Wilson's Heart quality - but in color. Note that Wilson Heart has extremely high texture quality - and I do hope I'm getting through to some here who know what I mean by Wilson's Heart quality. Or said differently, using the Rift CV1 I'm getting texture quality and lighting/shadows quality on an Alyx-class level - and performance using ""High"" (not dynamic) has been solid 90 fps. - I must be playing a different game than anyone else - because I just had one of my most awesome VR experience since Alyx.  
Sitting in the truck in the short intro ""Ollie's Age"" (or whatever it was called), I got really close to the soldier sitting on my right side - don't recall having seen much better skin details, think ""Lone Echo Olivia""-class. 
In short, I'm really trying hard to find anything that's wrong with this game - haven't found anything. I CAN EVEN USE MY LEFT HAND FOR LOCOMOTION AND FOR SHOOTING MY WEAPON - not even Alyx got that right! This game is 10/10 in my book!","Jan 6, 2021 at 5:22 PM",5, 66,

Rift S gameplay and Initial Impressions // RTX 2070 Super:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avX7CIJ-LBc

My Initial Impressions:
As a game that has been 4 years in development, don't expect a Half-Life: Alyx quality experience, instead expect a Medal Of Honor quality Vibe and experience. This is a slow burner with quite a lot of cutscenes interrupting the action at the start. I'm not a fan of this mechanic as it breaks up the action for me, but stick with it and the game gets better around Mission 2.
Combat is really good and satisfying, the locations look nice and the attention to detail is superb.
The game features 6 missions and I'm averaging 2 hours per mission, there are secrets to find if you choose to search for them, so you are looking at a 8-10 hour experience.
The game certainly has a lot of jank.... it can feel a little rushed at times and also disjointed.
Hopefully Respawn can take all the criticism from the negative reviews and turn this around with a bit more aftercare and polish.
If you are a boomer like me and have been a fan of Medal of Honor in the past, I think you're going to like this..... but maybe wait a while for a sale if you think the price is too steep.","Dec 12, 2020 at 3:28 AM",3, 499,

There are too many fundemental design flaws for this game to be recommended as a purchase. It's at best a clunky experience and a huge missed opportunity.

Pros
+ Return to the MOH franchise
+ (Some) Good set pieces
+ (Some) Good gameplay
+ Expressive (but too cartoonish) animations
+ Good selection of weapons

Cons
- Bad performance (unplayable with a 2060, playable but with stutters 2080 Super)
- Bad pacing (Constantly fades to black, gameplay broken up with aimless dialogue)
- Frustrating interactions (MG's locking to floor, ladders & climbing, weapon turrets)
- All NPC's seem to be 8 feet tall
- TERRIBLE dialogue (Corny to outright cringeworthy)
- Annoying characters
- Able to walk away from torso when in vehicle
- Some very low texures (even though game is 170GB
- Huge install size
- Unpopulated multi-player

Pros
- Consistent, gorgeous environments
- Set pieces you'll remember
- Feels true to MoH roots (loved MoH:AA)
- Multiplayer has 12 maps each incredible layouts and unique, with 5 fun game modes, although I've found deathmatch and conquest to be the most fun
- Weapon handling really benefits the game; each weapon is fun (bar sniper, see below)
- Character acting and unique characteristics, incl. facial scarring and movement animations (think L.A. Noire level)
- Fluidity of gameplay akin to Blood & Truth (PSVR hit)
- Really like the balance between the fun gameplay and serious Gallery overtones (which remind you war is most certainly not all fun and games - an important message and one I'm very glad Respawn sought to educate with this release; that came at a heavy price, yet they bore it)
- Overall mood, comedic elements, and setting is more appealing to me than it's closest down-trodden peers (TWD Saints & Sinners and Half-Life: Alyx).  In 2020, having fun storming Nazi bases is a great way to finish this year off.

Cons
- Bot AI in MP
- Player animations in MP
- Blocked scope periphery for sniper rifle
- Tutorial is a little protracted in places when options presented aren't explained (so you to explore each fork and that's a bit arduous)
- Multiplayer lobbies were a little sparse at launch (understandable), but was getting full, 12-player lobbies the day after
- Mad bomber mode was a neat MP concept but a little bit of a let down when playing it; not as fun as it sounded in the multiplayer trailer
- Price tag and storage space requirement (~180 GB on an SSD) will scare off a lot of folks

2022-05-28 20:33:44.515612,AnnieAnnihilator,Disappointing and unpolished,"Before I start with the actual review I would like to clarify that I have not yet finished the game and (apart from several installation errors) did not encounter any serious technical issues. MoH runs smoothly on my rig (1080 ti and I7 with Quest 2), loading times are not atrocious and I bought it on sale.
So all in all, it could definitely be worse if you look at some of the other reviews. 

However, I consider the gameplay itself and some of the design choices to be seriously flawed and simply cannot recommend the game, even though I would very much like to do so. And here is why:

From the start, every mission is divided into a multitude of sub-chapters leaving 
you to play for a few minutes in a usually very restricted environment, frequently interrupted by loading screens and way too many scripted events you cannot influence in any way. The whole game therefore feels like a fractured mess of mini arenas loosely connected by lackluster storytelling, extremely stereotypical characters and comedic episodes that simply feel out of place.

Apart from this, the immersion is constantly broken by weird design choices such as the obligatory training area in between missions (Quartermaster) where you shoot at dummies and actual live Nazis alike (they run through the gun range like headless chickens) and have every new item or gadget you might come across in the next mission explained to you beforehand via scale models or dressed up mannequins.

During missions, which have all been guns blazing and no stealth so far, enemies spawn literally out of thin air. Imagine clearing a compound and looking at the deserted place from a roof top only to find it magically repopulated with enemies a few seconds later once you pass an invisible spawn trigger point.

I can forgive the non-existent AI, weapons clipping through objects, weird physics and all the other little things like monstrously large Sherman tanks etc., but not the constant immersion breaking logical errors. Sorry.","Feb 18, 2021 at 8:24 AM",2, 4,

Multiplayer randomly stopped working...which was the saving grace of this game. I have tried for hours to get support, however EA does not even have a support page for this game!! So I will wait a few days to see if it fixed itself and then I will be refunding this game as it is missing a part of the game I payed for. 

The rest of my review I left as I wrote it before. I still believe it to be true...when it is working at all!!


The multiplayer portion of this game is actually pretty amazing. The campain however left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. As many other reviews will tell you, there are these long...awkward pauses in the dialog. The characters will have a convorsation with large gaps between what they say. Once they are finished talking to you...all of the characters just stare at you...for what feels like forever and then the screen goes to black and loads the level. 

Honestly there were other things that were minor annoyances to me but I did enjoy the game so much that I cant even really remember what they were. 
Glad I bought the game. Maybe after a few updates (especially with the dialog) and I would easily give this 5 stars.","Jan 31, 2021 at 10:36 AM",1, 12,

I'm glad I did because it's fantastic!! It captures the vibe of the original games perfectly. The music is Terrific like the old games (Michael Giachcino).  Yes, there are a lot of cut scenes but I liked the story and characters and there was some great humour.  

My older computer runs it perfectly fine and although picking up certain items is a bit awkward in a seated cockpit it is possible. The menu gives you a lot of options for control schemes. One big negative:  after waiting 8 hours for it to download i got the dreaded ""sorry your game failed to install"" message and it started downloading all over again but by the next morning it was working fine.

2022-05-28 20:33:47.650819,TristanDaShark,Great Game With Minor Cons,"This is a very accurate game in the sense of its mechanics and history. The looks of the weapons and scenery depict an accurate setting of the 1940s in WW2, with defenses and homes alike looking like they fit into the time you are playing in. The gameplay, for the most part, is involved and fun, and you are never truly left out of the action. 

Now, I have an over-specced processor for this game, but slighty under-specced GPU for this game, with a Ryzen 9 3900x and an RTX 2070 Super, respectively. However, the gameplay is stuttery most of the time, and is only perfect during scenes where you aren't allowed to move; the narration scenes. Now this could be because of my slightly under-specced GPU but the stuttering is heavy during the gameplay. 

Also, so far throughout my gameplay experience, I have not found out a way to actualy save in-game progress besides completing missions, which sucks since each mission can take quite a long time to beat (30-45 minutes for me). So, if you want to get a quick game of VR in before going out somewhere, this game is not ideal for that particular situation, and, instead, should only be played when you have ample amounts of time and your legs are not tired. 

Also, something the game should have is a crouch button. Now, I know this is a VR game and you can bend down in real life to crouch in-game, but it is an inconvenience, especially during situations where you may have to crouch to hide for a prolonged period of time. Plenty of other VR games have a crouch button implemented into the controls, such as The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners (My personal favorite VR horror experience). 

To conclude, Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is an amazing and immersive WW2 VR experience if you can get around the slight graphical errors that occur quite often.","Jun 23, 2021 at 2:31 PM",4, 0,

This Game is NOT state of the ART like a Title for this price (i did pay almost 40 in the Sale for it) 

Suggetion : buy it under 35 for that what it is.

Also i do have a lot of Fun with this game and i think i missed some side mission events that i will play later on.

Air guns where a little complicated to use at least for me somtimes the tracking in this game, does not place me right in the Game turrent spots.
over all its fun duck shooting enemy and have a wide variety of  levels.

if they had done less scripting and a more open level design, this could have been a great title !

i aculally really enjoy and like the game so far

4 stars for the Game itself, it has gotten to many bad ratings for how much fun it is.

price tag is not okay imho.","Feb 24, 2021 at 11:11 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 20:33:47.716643,Bangieboy,"Not so much AAA+, more like CCC-","First things first, if you are expecting something like Battlefield 1 (or V) in VR, move on. This game is inferior in every aspect to the 4 year old Battlefield 1, from graphics to level design to gameplay to acting. This game is essentially a collection of multiple short, linear WW2 set pieces strung together to create 6 main 'levels', most are forgettable but some are pretty good (fighting off ME109's from a B17 is a standout, sniping from a rooftop is also well done). The short nature of each set piece can be jarring which somewhat breaks the VR immersion. Graphically the game ranges from decent to fairly poor (for a game you need over 300gb space to run and upgrade). The NPC's are also pretty poor, looking dated (think pre Skyrim) and some of the voice acting is embarrasing (think Allo Allo). The little English dude with the Harry Potter glasses and mockney accent is so annoying I've tried to shoot him myself a few times. The gunplay is decent and intuitive (you hit what you aim at) and I like the way weapons snap back into place to avoid fumbling/dropping them like in some other VR games, however you still have to charge your weapon again after changing mags even if you still have a round in the chamber, which is pretty lazy as almost every other VR shooter out there doesn't do that. The game installed without issue for me and ran effortlessly from start to finish on an i7 7700 with GTX 1070 Gigabyte P57 gaming laptop. I did need to clear over 300gb for the installation to be able to run upgrades without having to uninstall and reinstall every time. To put that into perspective, that is more space required than any other AAA game I have ever owned, and MOHAAB is not an AAA game. Overall I did have some fun playing the game, but not £46 worth of fun, more like maybe £25 worth, £30 at a push. What would make it better? Larger individual levels, better textures, 2020 style NPC's (as opposed to 2010 style), better voice acting. Overall, 3 stars.","Jan 12, 2021 at 7:28 AM",3, 14,

2022-05-28 20:33:54.004493,SockDP,Demanding and huge but beautiful,"Update: I've been playing further into the campaign and all i can say is wow! Immersion is on a whole different level with this game (other than the breaks between levels). It does start off a bit slow, but trust. It gets so much better with the later missions. I won't spoil much, but be ready for some really thrilling fast paced action, chases, and beach storming. That being said you do need top of the line hardware to get the most out of this game, but I can confidently rank this game in the top 3 of VR games. Get it if you can run it.

Original: On a RTX 3080, it is running smooth like melted butter. The textures are gorgeous and incredibly immersive, and I am liking the narrative so far. I do wish the campaign was a bit more connected and explorative as opposed to being built on short mission levels with numerous (although short) loading screens, but other than that, it is amazing. The strategy gameplay element of setting up mission scenarios is a nice touch as well. The gunplay is particularly satisfying and reactive. The physics are solid and the sounds are fantastic as well. I think they could have managed to make the game a bit less storage intensive and easier on the required hardware specs forsure, but my experience was beyond solid. I can't wait to finish the campaign! Highly recommended if your system is up to snuff.","Dec 13, 2020 at 8:56 AM",5, 41,

The only sniper in the game is the kar98, the unscoped rifle is also considered a sniper, they dont need to be reloaded, they fire until youre out of ammo entirely, not to mention the sniper scope is a joke that makes things smaller rather than larger. Enemy AI is a joke, same with their animations. The opening 4 training segments are laughably bad, actually hilarious. Save yourself from the torment of playing this game.

3. Well made story, as is expected from this franchise,

Cons. (Please note I play on the hardest dificulty)

1. There is NO ONE on multiplayer. This is a huge deal breaker for me, as mutiplayer is where the replay value is. If I wanna play AI, there are tons of cheaper options.
2. A single mission is soooo long. left me burnt out.
3. Game almost always re
spawns you in the middle of enemy fire, so you respawn half dead.
4. AI Shotgun is a guaranteed hit no matter what you do and leaves you at 1 hitpoint.

Their love for this title shows, through the detail and art style and story. The addition of the real war footage and Hero interviews adds to the immersion of the story and what's at stake. Thank you for this. It would be a real shame if America forgot its greatest generation.

Okay, the first update has been released (12/14/2020). Just to hit the highlights, of the biggest changes. 

1) They removed all of the ""Victory"" screens, except when a Mission has been completed. It used to be after every completed step of the mission goals, nine for each mission, six missions.

2) They added smooth turning in the ""VR Comfort"" options. They also allow you to choose how fast you would like to turn, default 50%.

3) Made it easier to pick up weapons at the weapons range.

4) Made the ""Ping"" louder on the M1 Garand rifle, to signify an empty clip.

5) Various multi-player fixes, general fixes and optimization fixes.

UPDATE (12/18/20) - Change Highlights

1) The ability to change how you move. It now allows controller directional movement, not just head directional movement.

2) The players sleeves disappear when near the face. It will now not block the view down the sites for dominate-hand use while using the opposite eye to aim.

3) Added - A number of adjustment abilities for better control of graphics. Allowing for a better gameplay experience on lower-end machines.

4) New players will default to not showing rank (stars) on the enemies. It can be toggled on. Existing players will keep their settings. 

5) They fixed the eyes on the NPC's. The bulging eyes were, uhm, offputting.

UPDATE ( 12/21/2020) - Change Highlights (Last One)

1) Option to remove your torso and sleeves.

2) Full screen sniper scope w/zoom button.

3) Multiplayer quick join button.

2022-05-28 20:34:03.578203,jrbone,Same Captain America BS,"I wanted to like this game. If the storyline was purely a work of fiction, I might go as high as 4 stars. But as a fan of historical and regular realism, I can't give this any more than 2 stars in good conscience. If you want to shoot nazis and be a dramatic hero on a ridiculous stage, fine. This game is for you.

If, on the other hand, you want to revisit WWII in any meaningful way, save your money. I pity those who play this game and think they know anything about WWII as a result. 

The following contains minor spoilers from 4 hours of gameplay.

What brought me from being excited about this game to asking for a refund (Denied, unfortunately) took place in about 4 hours of gameplay. From the start, none of the characters could be a real person. They are all there to kiss your butt and make you into a hero. The first incling I had that something was majorly wrong was at the beginning of the first mission. American Sergeant, an underaged English soldier, two members of the French Resistance, and I (an American) drove through the French countryside in an open truck towards Resistance HQ. The three allied soldiers are in uniform. One Resistance member is in plainclothes. The other is wearing a freaking Nazi uniform as she is supposedly undercover (and proceeds to openly do resistance stuff in the same outfit). None of the resistance members speaks more than a few words of french; nor do the Nazis speak German. Naturally, the first mission concludes with the sole American being the biggest hero out of this Resistance group. 
Even on hard difficulty, tactics are not much of a necessity. At everything but long distances, a hip-fired MP40 will mow down anything that needs mowing. Bullets fail to pierce objects that they obviously should, which makes me wonder where the 170 gb I downloaded went. Explosive barrels are conveniently placed for dramatic scenes. A DCA can shoot down 6 Stukas without adjusting for altitude.

2022-05-28 20:34:06.742318,GoFlyUTR,MOH:AaB is a remarkable achievement!!,"First off, I'd like to say that this game is AMAZING in VR and it runs on my rig at default settings with no issues whatsoever.  I'm running my VR on a ten-year old computer, on which I've only upgraded the Operating System, GPU card, and hard drive.  My PC has an Intel i7 CPU 920 @ 2.67 GHz, 12 GB of DDR3 RAM, NVidia GTX 1070, and a 2 TB SSD.  That being said, it's likely that those having issues are running standard hard disks.  My SSD is probably the most important investment I've ever made for performance, because most games are disk-intensive ... as a result, I've never had any issues with any VR game.  Your PC should be 100% SSD, or it's going to struggle no matter what CPU, GPU, or memory you have.

It's hard to express how different it is playing a WWII shooter in VR versus on a monitor.  The immersiveness is beyond anything I've ever experienced.  You're in a firefight, running behind trucks while people are firing at you and you are (literally!) ducking for cover!  I'm pressed up against a wall and peeking my head out the window to see what's coming down the road.  Some German soldier walks in the room and you become frantic when you realize you need to reload.

MOH puts you right inside of World War II in a way that, frankly, I just was not expecting.  The sense of immersion is amazing and the graphics, sound, and environment in MOH are all terrific.  Even when you are back at your own base learning the basics, there are people and activity all around you.  It really feels like you are in Europe in the early 1940s.  For the first time ever playing a game, I also got an appreciation for just how terrifying it must have been to be in WWII.

I'm still early in the missions, but I can already state that this is worth the $60 price tag.  If you have a decent GPU, a reasonable amount of RAM, and (most definitely) a Solid State Drive ... then you should have a blast with this game!","Dec 14, 2020 at 4:58 AM",5, 10,

Je ne crois pas avoir vu de missions/environnements aussi variés dans un jeu VR depuis que j'en fais (2017). 

Graphiquement : C'est moins fin qu'un HL:A, mais on peut aisément le comprendre quand on voit dans quels espaces on évolue tout au long de l'aventure. Il ne s'agit ici pas uniquement de couloirs/salles/escaliers mais d'espaces plein air plutôt inspirés : trains, avions, bunkers, Manoirs etc... 
La direction artistique est superbe, les détails sont impressionnants. Se retrouver dans un QG allemand & découvrir des cartes de France d'il y a 60 ans avec des villes & villages qui nous sont familiers, c'est superbe !

Son : Très bonne musique ""cinéma"" qui colle parfaitement à l'ambiance du jeu et au contexte. Les clins d'oeils aux premiers MoH font plaisir. La musique originale est vraiment impeccable. Les sons ambiants sont parfaits eux aussi. Entre les rafales de MG42, le ping du M1, les cris des soldats, nickel.

Performances : Je joue sur une RTX 2080Ti & un i9 9000k / 32Go RAM

Avec tout à fond, j'ai quelques mini saccades sur certaines missions (notamment niveaux en mouvement) 
A voir avec les patchs à venir, mais il suffit de tweaker un peu les settings et ça le fait :)

Franchement, c'est beaucoup plus nerveux & vif qu'un HL:A, en même temps, les séquences de combat sont beaucoup plus nombreuses. La visée est un peu tricky au départ, mais c'est parce qu'il n'y a ici pas de viseur à point rouge ou autre. Il faut vraiment viser à l'ancienne, et ça moi je kiff !
Le smooth moving a été ajouté, le tracking est au top, le rechargement de certaines armes a été simplifié pour plus de fun. Rien à redire.

Multi : Pas encore essayé. 

Jeu sous évalué lors de sa sortie, mais on voit qu'il y a clairement du travail derrière. C'est un incontournable pour moi, même à 52€.","Dec 20, 2020 at 9:43 PM",5, 11,

The graphics settings are non existent and smooth turn isn't in the game, however the devs have confirmed they WILL BE ADDED IN FUTURE PATCHES.

That might sound like a bold statement, but I'm confident you'll agree if you purchase this game you won't be disappointed and ultimately you'll see that we have entered a new era in VR FPS Gaming. MoHAB is a technical masterpiece in every way, it's also a fully fledged Triple A VR title which includes the best single player campaign we've seen, it's well worth the asking price, the compelling story and gameplay mechanics are complimented by the best environments I've seen in any previous VR title, the game is exciting addictive and more than a LOT of FUN to play, I honestly couldn't put it down.. simply Brilliant, Everything about it is class.

First of all, this game has brought me back to what I knew medal of honour for - great story line and fun shooter. 

Depth of the story is great and I like the ease of how the weapons work. Personally K98 is my favourite!! 

I’m on the second mission, towards the end and it’s filling me with joy! If your on the edge of buying this game and have the recommended hardware I would just buy it. Been playing for about 5 hours and still on mission 2 to there plenty to do and see. 

Games very much like a movie, lots of moments of speech and it gets you in the story well but then there is lots of action also. Throwing grenades to throwing kitchen pans when your out of ammo, putting on a German helmet undercover and beating the hell out of a Nazi is awesome.

2022-05-28 20:34:22.563361,BlackxXxFox,Foundations of a would be good game,"First off, i must say i was dissappointed with this game from jump street. I cant believe that such a prestigeous studio (Respawn) could fall so hard. Then again this is an EA owned studio, so there's that. The game looks dated, runs poorly, and has an almost 200 GB install size, all this not to mention the requirements to run this game. I run Cyberpunk 2077 at ULTRA RTX 144hz, this game stutters and has a hard time keeping up with even low level set pieces. Halflife runs on my PC at Ultra settings without a mention of stutter or graphic issues. I really wish this game felt like a game, one that has a cohesive and believeable story, one that paid homage to those that have served before me. This game does honor them, although it isnt through game play or story intrigue. 

Respawn! you guys really let me down, i wish that i waited for reviews before i bought this hot piece of trash. Even the loading screens look uninspired. That said the shooting is fun and the potential for a great game is there, could you or would it be too much for a fan and a veteran to ask for you guys to overhaul the game? To make it flow better? to be better optimized? I mean MOH AA is a better game even to todays standards, why didnt you guys just recreate those game? 

To bad i cant get a refund or bought a differnt game. I know this is your first take at a VR game but since i cant get my money back and i dont see or hear any PR or Social Media response... I will boycott what ever game you make next and i will promise to actively rail against you by influencing others to avoid what ever you make next.

There is 6 missions. Each has 9 levels. A mission is approximatly 1 hour and a half / 2 hours long. Every missions have cool stuff, you play in a tank, in a plane, on a motorbike, you swim, you are on ski, etc... It's very fun!

Other thing, the SCALE IS TOO BIG!

Multiplayer is very funny but the game need some improvement:
- We can't see game, we just can auto join one... We need a list of differents games, or an option to join games with a lot of players.
Please make an update for those things and improve Matchmaking or merge servers, as i said, a list of differents games by world region can be a good option to group players between them!

May be multiplayer need to be sold separetly than the campaign. This game is awesome but build a player base is not easy in VR. We need some ranking or things to unlock to keep players in.","Dec 22, 2020 at 2:49 AM",5, 4,

Running on a 1080ti and a 3700k proccessor with SSD storage used for the game I still get constant stutters and audio randomly cuts in and out which is so immersion breaking. I could easily run Alyx on my PC with no stutters and issues so this is really dissapointing. They really need to worry about optimizing the PC version before they even start to think about a Quest verison as this is borderline unplayable for me. I'm not going to refund out of hopes that they come back and optimize it because the gun play and graphics are so amazing but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed. If this game gets fixed than its an easy 5 stars and by far the best VR shooter out there, and if you have the specs to run it than you will love it. But not a ton of people have hardware like that so it seems like a massive mistake to design a game like this. Please fix it so I can enjoy this amazing experience that you all have made

I have run this on Quest 2 with Oculus link cable and also wirelessly with virtual desktop and both worked smoothly. Some slight compression artifacts in the night skies with Virtual Desktop. They are some minor bugs like objects remaining highlighted or weird torso movement. There has been some criticism of short gameplay sessions early on but it gets much better in Mission 2 and 3 (where I currently am). There are some really exciting and surprising situations. I felt queasy on the back of the truck in France and had to look down my nose at the carpet, but I have been fine on the other vehicles so far. The graphics are really good for VR and the gameplay is fairly easy on Normal and my overall impression is that this is just a lot of fun, which is kind of the point of games. While Halflife Alyx is technically more impressive the way it handles object interactions and is more polished, it is much darker in mood. It is strange that Medal of Honor feels lighter and more fun while it is about the horror of war, but that is OK if you recognise that. I have not delved into the veteran interviews yet but I look forward to that. We need to support developers and be more forgiving. It is incredible what this technology can do and it seemed like an impossibility when I was a kid.

2022-05-28 20:34:32.070785,Grendyl,"After rough install, game is very good","I have updated my review after my full playthrough.  I used Quest 2 with Ryzen 7 3700X and 2070 super.  I found 32GB RAM to be key to performormance. I had frame drops in intensive areas with 16GB RAM, but even most intensive areas ran smoothly with 32GB.
Respawn has released some game updates too.  

This game is fantastic and great visually.  The levels are well designed with excellent attention to detail.  This game is among the most fun I have had in VR, and there were plenty of ""Wow!"" moments.  The single player campaign is a series of discrete mission scenarios.  They play out like a playable popcorn movie within a story framework based on the WW2 campaign in Europe, with cutscenes mixed in.  The playable scenarios provide a lot of variety in location and gameplay, with picturesque visuals across the landscape.  In watching videos in the WW2 gallery, I was struck by the similarities of the landscapes in the game vs what I saw in the videos on location in France.  

To keep the load times between missions minimal, I would only install this game on an SSD (not a hard drive).  The updates gave graphical options to help provide a smooth experience, added smooth turning, and addressed various concerns raised by the VR community.  
 I am playing the campaign through a 2nd time now that 3d scopes are an option.  They are very good!  There are many options to turn off UI text, mission objectives, etc for a very realistic view.  The game is in a very good place now.
$60 is the same price HL Alyx was at launch and I find this game more fun.  Comparing visual apples to apples (wood, stone, brick, vehicles, etc.), I think this game looks better.

No matter what drive you install it on, it uses your main drive to unpack the install.  It would not install for me until I freed enough space on C: drive.  It installed the game on D: drive and didn't use any space on C: after install.  I heard that the install space requirement on C: was reduced in the updates.

I kept wondering when I would get to the end of each mission. The playability was fun and exciting. The stories were moving at times. The real videos of actual people that were in ww2 moved me to tears. 
I finally finished the game last night and of all the fantastic game play, there were a few very minor bugs but none were game breaking. 
But after all that amazing work they put into it they must have got tired at the end or something.. no rolling credits, no cut scene.. last battle, fly off into the sunset.. back to main menu. I feel you really messed up on this one guys. All your hard work flopped at the end. You could have rolled credits and that would have been fine. But just nothing??  But don’t let that stop you from playing this game. It’s a wonderful game even if you are a lover of ww1/2 games. Definitely worth the 60 bucks except for the piss poor ending.","Jan 14, 2021 at 11:31 PM",5, 1,

It took me 3 tries before I figured out, that windows defender was blocking the install. It would download the whole game, go to install it, and fail. Then I'd have to re download it all over again. I had to add an exception to the Oculus software folder it get it to finally work. Serious pain in the butt. 

Other than that, the game runs pretty smooth on a GTX 2080 super, i7 6700k, 16 gigs of RAM. 

It just needs some fixing on the graphical side. I hate the zoom mechanics on the scopes. Don't black out your periphery, just blur it like every other VR shooter! Also, what is up with the forearms? They get in the way when I go to aim down the sights on other rifles. It's really awkward. Please fix this! 60 bucks is pretty steep for such a glitchy game. Did you not have play testers?

The reloads and ""ping"" of the Garand could be so much more satisfying. The game does a lot of things well and others will leave you wanting. It is true that there are Way too many transitions/loading screens for any mission, but the missions get longer and longer as you progress. Singleplayer is definitely worth it and multiplayer has had it's fun moments. I wish survival was Co-op and i feel like they would have benefited a Lot from having online Co-op.

They did a lot of work and MP and Survival mode run almost perfect. I really cannot think of any other VR title that comes as close to this from an overall game experience. 

Quick note for Quest users using link:

A user on the forum turned me on to an interesting setting. I was getting the weirdest frame drops that after a while I did not think was the game, it turns out windows 10 has a ""Game Mode"" that when I turned off in settings. Even before the patch it made noticeable differences turning that off , I think finding that setting, and the patch makes the game run close to butter. I will sleep well tonight.


Original Review:
Its true MOH once you get past the hopefully early shortcomings, will be playing this for years if the devs treat it right.  Amazing overall ! 

Rating it a 5 because I have seen stuff that couldnt hold a candle to this getting 5's 

Pro's:
Beautiful environments (once graphics were tweaked outside of the game) you just want to stop and look around at stuff
True MOH gameplay style in VR
I am enjoying the campaign immensely  
Cannot stop playing 

Cons:
Online seems to be laggy , semi auto weapons sometimes don't seem to fire per trigger pull. 
Optimization, Optimization , Optimization 
No clear way to report bugs, which by default makes you worry about the money you spent
Snap Turn (being addressed)

The game itself has a lot of the tweaks that you'd expect from a well developed VR title to help reduce motion sickness, which is great as a game can be ruined without them. It's still a bit early for me to give a proper review, but I hope EA continue working on it and fixing the bugs.  But then again this is EA we are talking about.

So far, graphics are good, story telling is good, great audio, and some of the guns are fun to use / load, some a bit less so.  I haven't got it for the multiplayer aspect so can't comment on that, but if you want a good 1st person VR game; it's worth a try.","Dec 13, 2020 at 8:34 PM",4, 4,

Super fun, definitely worth playing (not that it wasn't before, just feels more polished now).

There are still some bugs, hence the 4 star vice 5.  I've run into several scripted oddities so far.  ""Get in X"" and when I stand there the ring prompt disappears but I don't get in X so the game gets stuck as an example.

I rarely write reviews, but couldn’t help my self here. I was a huge fan of CoD 1 for pc back in the day and this is like that, in VR, and on roids. The visuals are stunning and a perfect set up for the excellent level crafting. I frankly don’t agree with all of the so-so reviewing I’m seeing here, and don’t feel it’s doing the title justice. I’ve tried all of the other fps go-to’s available for VR and there’s a lot of great content, but this game really nails it down in every front, in my opinion. I actually really enjoy the cut scene moments and the narrative they provide as you run through the classic type of combat scenarios you come to expect from this genre, and that’s not a bad thing at all. It all feels very familiar but with a fine craft behind it that a company like Respawn is know for providing. I think the best pro would be combat and game feel, everything just plays so smooth. 

I’m playing on rift s and have a 1080ti and things run butter smooth, aside from the occasional stutters on the most complex scenes, but that has not caused any distribution to gameplay, just noticeable.

The missions are very small and it seems like the true time being spent is cutscenes, dialogue, and movies with 10 minute shoot outs [if you have trouble killing quickly] and the game runs terribly. The controller haptics cause guns/hands to lose tracking every burst shot or rapid semi-automatic pulls so you will be healing between kills often. Turning haptics off STILL causes tracking loss and the screen tearing and constant loading every few steps, though it takes seconds, hinders game play. I refuse to play multiplayer due to the game barely running correctly and shootouts being such a chore. My PC runs every VR game buttery smooth at any settings except for this one and judging by reviews many others feel the same. I might deal with the game with minor graphical bugs and MAYBE deal with the constant loading and random bugs with the environment but when I can't shoot and when the missions only last 5-10 minutes I can't stand by this purchase. I regret spending ANY money on this and Oculus refuses to refund my purchase because I spent more than 2 hours playing. 80% of that time was waiting for the game to play or dealing with the problems and trying to find a work around.

I hope in the long run that they will release a few patches to fix some issues. Maybe add smooth turning and a few other things. Seems to take a few minutes too long to load into the actual game and each level/area transition takes anywhere from two minutes up to about four'ish minutes.

Overall good though . . . not great . . . but good. I have been using an off-brand link to my quest to play this that I picked up on Amazon for fairly cheap. Runs fairly smooth. A hiccup here or there. Price point of $60.00 seems to be a problem for some folks. I find it an alright price point if they can fix some of the issues . . but if  they can not than they should knock it down $10.00 or so. 

Overall good though. I would say try it at least.","Dec 13, 2020 at 5:46 AM",3, 2,

SO INTENSE , full of action !

Its the first time a game got me crawling in my room as fast as possible to take cover !
Mission 4 and above are the meat of the story .

Dont worry about the ""cuscenes"" , although i still hate the idea , its not that bad in VR.

Multiplayer kinda sucks , basically it sucks a lot . Its just plain pvp nothing to achieve nothing to upgrade nothing to customize(other than selecting default presets). Matches go from intense to very boring kinda waiting for the match to finish.

Thats why 4/5 but overall very enjoyable.

2022-05-28 20:35:07.349659,Ridillr,Not true to the old games.,"I do enjoy this game. WW2 content has always been my favorite basis for video games, and the experience of getting to use a Garand or an MP40 to wreck some nazis is wonderful. I do have issues with it though.

This game doesn't quite have the feel of the old Medal of Honor games. In my opinion, Pacific Assault was MoH in its prime. Above and Beyond hasn't been on par so far in almost any respect, other than the fact it's a WW2 game.

The weapon functionality isn't great. For starters, if you fire an SMG the bullets may decide to come out sideways, regardless of the orientation of the weapon. Recoil is not to blame in this case and it doesn't really make sense. It's one of those FPS mechanics that isn't meant for VR. The reload has you pulling the bolt back in all the automatics regardless of the gun's actual remaining ammo count. The shotgun reload doesn't even let you handle the shells and the lever action has the same issue. The Garand apparently has a clip ejection button, instead of actually having to pull the charging handle to eject the remaining rounds.

Finally, the story has been rough. The action is constantly interrupted by ""cutscenes"" that have you standing around listening to all the other characters. The combat comes in bursts instead of a steady flow. I've heard it will be better in Mission 2, and I'm very nearly there, but so far all these issues have been a bit of a turn-off.

Overall, don't spend $60 if you want a true-to-the-title or mechanically accurate game.","Dec 26, 2020 at 9:00 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 20:35:10.522798,NotAMartian,Not Sure It's worth It...,"Man, there is a lot right and a lot more wrong with this game than I was expecting. For every cool feature or decent design choice you will find some questionable ones. So far into my experience, I will say that the game is decently fun but the price is too steep regardless of the decent amount of content and I have no idea why this file size is so large. Its no Half-life but its not another VR tech demo.

Here are a couple of examples of good/cool features that come bundled with a few poor design choices to illustrate my previous point (these aren't even all of them but just those i can think of off the top of my head):

-Gun machanics are pretty fun with some interesting reload ideas thrown in for the player to have fun with. That said the sniper when aimed will give you a black periphery vision with a centered visible circle for aiming and the sight renders the other side of the scope  in 2D (...why? other shooters have been getting snipers right in VR for years now). Also, your virtual arm gets in the way of some of the sights on your weapons when aiming.

-weapons automatically reholster when dropped, but swapping weapons is a pain since the last selected weapon will be replaced, meaning you have to go back to the weapon you want to get rid of first and then select a new one (doesn't sound bad or complicated but it is immersion breaking and kinda annoying). This mechanic isn't helped by the fact that this game has a habit of making you pick up anything and everything in your vicinity except for the object you are actually aiming to pick up.

-It actually has a story (which is oddly paced, incredibly cheesy, and constantly interrupts the gameplay) and decent voice actors (that are given cringy dialogue and have them edited into the game at odd intervals making conversations seem stilted).","Dec 13, 2020 at 2:05 PM",3, 2,

Dont go into this game thinking half life alyx, go in thinking medal of honor. This 
game runs smooth for me but I do have the recommended specs. Mine are RTX 2080 super, i7 9700k and 16GB of ram. It does advise to install on a SSD but i have a 4TB hard drive which I installed it on and it runs fine. Takes the game about 1min to load up from the start.

I am enjoying the astory mode but as everyone els says about the cut scenes and the phase in and out is not the best. I have lost count of the amount of times I have died in this game as i do find it hard but enjoyable. 

I do belive respwan will patch this is in the coming weeks to improve some of its flaws as that seems to be the norm in most new vr games. 

I do hear of this game crashing for some people but from what i can see its only steam users. I have had no crashes yet, all smooth my end. Also the game is playable from graphics card as low as 1660 super from what av heard on reveiws.","Dec 22, 2020 at 11:57 PM",4, 1,

I would love to rate it higher but it simply has too many little things that bother me. Multiplayer needs some work, specifically on the loadouts. I wish we could create a legit loadout (similar to Onward) rather than picking one gun and one ""gadget"" I guess you would call it. I play this game on a 1660 ti with link and it stutters quite a bit when I launch it but once I get going and play for a bit It becomes smooth as butter. Also I look forward to new guns. There simply aren't enough, especially in multiplayer. Gunplay is very good but its the minor details that hold it back. And any time you enter a turret or an AA gun you controll it based on where you look, not physical controls. This is a huge hit and needs to be changed to either joysticks or in game controls (the nose and tail guns on the b-17 were great) The story is very very good but it feels blocky or chunky with loading screens after almost every encounter (the update may have fixed this, I havent checked.). Very curious about DLCs too. Overall, this game is very good with a few kinks but it has a lot of potential. Im sure that over time it will all get workked out and this will become my top vr game ever.","Dec 16, 2020 at 3:47 AM",4, 1,

With that out of the way, we can get to reviewing the campaign. I was very impressed at first. I spent a lot of time messing around with all the weapons in the training areas and the gun play is top notch, most of the time. Then I got to a couple oudoor scenes with a lot of foliage and complexity, which caused the visuals to nosedive into the ground. Mostly the game looks wonderful so I'm guesisng my 3600X and 3060 ti don't have enough juice.

Half-Life Alyx this is not; and now that I have been playing Population 1 for weeks, the movement mechanics for both feel antiquated. Pop 1 has full body inverse kenematics (modeling), wheras MoH VR only models your hands with locked wrists. 

So far, it seems like lots of things are out of scale, like character models are ten to fifteen percent too big. I'm 5'9 and all the charcter models, included all women, seem good foot or more taller than me. 

How were so many bad decisions made and retained?! The action sequence missions are essentially crappy barf rollercoasters and there is a level where you climb through a sinking ship that is no joke the worst level in any game I'm played in recent memory.

Ok... so I just played the first half of the Norway mission set and it's so awful I just docked another star. Respawn should apologize for the bad one liners, ongoing shouting by allies during a supposed stealth / sniper misson and a vomit inducing ski sequence. Absolutely pathetic; it should have been scrapped entirely. 

Then the second half of the Norway mission set was incredible. How were these missons made by the same people?!

Additional Feeback: 
1. Why the hell can't I carry a knife on my person? Not being able to holster a knife seems like a horrific oversight. Please add asap. 
2. It took me minutes, plural, to figure out how to load the MG42. It didn't occur to me for far too long that I was suppoed to simply whip out a 250 round ammo can from a magical invisible pouch on my hip belt.

I am having a lot more fun than I have in a many VR games and I've had VR for at least 4 years.  Graphics are terrific and the guns are pretty varied.  I'm not a hard core gun guy so this is about as realistic as I would want.  

The cons are definitely the need for graphics options.  I don't understand how that was not added.  There is a way to adjust through ini in the folder and it helps ALOT but you shouldn't have to do that in a AAA game.  I also didn't like the VICTORY screens, but they've since removed that in an update.

Overall = really fun and exciting game and if the developers keep improving it will be great.","Dec 15, 2020 at 11:07 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 20:35:45.553399,questatmayne,"Terrible realism, immersion, mechanics","Buy it if you only care about having an interesting and creative story.
Do not buy it if you care about immersion, Historical accuracy, realism and convenient and yet realistic game mechanics.
For me the biggest turn off what the game mechanics like for example, you strictlly have a rifle class weapon on your left shoulder and an SMG/LMG class weapon on your right + sidearm on your belt holster. Want to run around with an MP40 and and A gewehr 43? nope, game won't let you. 
The ammo system is garbage. Basically you have 3 crates of ammo in the game. 1 for rifles, 1 for SMGs, 1 for pistols. You can use an M1 Garand deep in German territory and have an infinite supply of ammunition available despite Germans not using most calibers the Allies used.
Also the Kar98k has cartridge capacity of 1 round in this game, but also you never actually reload the Kar98k. you bolt it until you actually run out of all of your spare ammo. no 5 round mag with clip insert. just infinte bolting. 
Want to fire just half of your Pistol's or SMG's mag and do quick reload? nope, you reaload and operate the bolt/slide because apparently the developer was too lazy to program that as well. In real life and most FPS games out there, you do not have to operate the slide/bolt of these weapons if the chamber has a round in it. This game doesn't care about that.
Story also makes no strategic sense at times. Like for example Why would the OSS agree to send untis all the way from the UK to stop a train at Schmerzen to stop some insignicant captured French resistance Girl Named Juliette, who is heading for Berlin for special interogation (because apparently all the top ranking Gestapo agents based in France were on their summer vacation apparantely)
The Ai in normal combat sittuation speak perfect German, but in Schmerzen, they spoke English with an accent, while the Sgt. was  practicing his German only to speak English with a fake accent. What gives?tbh this game is worth 2 star,, but im generous.","Feb 11, 2021 at 1:48 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 20:35:48.713037,KStro9,Mostly Impressive So Far,"Really, everyone should play this and be sure to check the gallery.  The true story of what these people did cannot be over appreciated.  

I have only had this game a short time, but am impressed in most areas so far.  I like the story and the immersiveness is superb.  I like the way they worked in doing the settings as part of the story.  The NPC characters are done very well.  The environment is impressive. Probably the best I have seen in VR except for Half Life: Alyx .  I like the the cut scene interactions as it puts you in the story a little deeper than most shooters.

My only real complaint so far is the interaction with objects seems a little off at times.  It can be difficult to pick up the item you are going for.  You often accidentally grab the one next to it, even if the hand is right one the one you want.  It was really bad in the shooting range at the beginning when trying to pick up grenades from the table.  There were other smaller similar issues.   So far I have played just on my CV1 Rift with 3 ceiling mounted sensors. That is usually the best setup for accurate tracking and it still has this issue.  No other experiences have an issue like that with this setup.  I will try it later on my Quest with Oculus link setup to see if it is any different.

This game is big .  In the system I used so far, the OS is on an SSD, but the game is loaded on a 4TB hard drive.  In some cases the load times seemed a little longer than expected, I am assuming mostly due to the amount of data being loaded and being installed on a large hard drive.   

I have currently only tried it on one PC, 16 GB, Ryzen 7 1700X with an 8GB GTX 1080.  Despite the video card being a generation behind the recomended spec of a GTX 2080, it seemd to run without any issue and looked very impressive.  I will use a different PC when I test in on Oculus Link for comparison.

My experience so far: fix the tracking, then 5 stars.","Jan 18, 2021 at 3:17 PM",4, 0,

You should only have to do this when the last mag was *completely* emptied.

There are plenty of reviews out there to tell you all the other things about this game.  I think it's pretty good overall, some good graphics and gun fights, a few epic moments, but sometimes it just feels a little cheesy and arcady, rather than gritty, scary and and serious, like a war game should feel IMO.  I'm not impressed with the AI, they seem to be only as advanced as the Nazis that I was just killing in Return to Castle Wolfenstein (nearly 20-year-old game).  they like to just stand or run around in the open during a firefight waiting to get hit, and their animations are a little silly looking to me, the way they run esp.  as others have said I wish there was a little more/better physics, and more interaction with the world around you, this feels very much like Asgard's Wrath in how the world around you feels like it's made out of plastic and your hands go through most things.
