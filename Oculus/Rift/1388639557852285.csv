Online Multiplayer is a ghost town though. It's on Steam also, so I would have expected more action. People are really missing out.","Feb 27, 2018 at 10:48 AM",5, 9,

You use your left Touch controller to control a lever where you can move forward and back and turn left or right.  Then you have this flipper in the front of your tractor where you can ""kick"" the soccer ball either as a pass to your teammate or closer to the goal with your right controller.   Of course you can also just crash into soccer to move it, but the flipper gives you more control.  You can also use turbo to get wherever you need quicker.  Along the track, there will be powerups or powerdowns.  You can strategically use these to gain the upperhand.  You can play solo exhibition, career, or online multiplayer.  There will be lots of crashing and mayhem involved.  You get a nice immersive view inside the tractor and it goes fast, but no so much that any experienced VR afficionado would feel any nausea.  Obviously, the most fun would be multiplayer 2v2 and hopefully players will flock into this game like with Rocket League.  Hella tractor fun.  Rating 9/10, 10/10 with more updates adding more content and game modes.  But already worth the price of admission and a standout in a crowded field.","Oct 5, 2017 at 9:52 AM",5, 9,
