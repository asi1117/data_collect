2022-05-28 13:36:20.016642,BobbyWasabi0317,Talk about a Just Dance on VR,This game is amazing. I can't believe how this flew past my radar when it came out. Definately would recommend if you are a fan of dancing. The pro difficulty was exactly the challenge I was looking for.,Apr 15 at 7:58 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:36:20.032599,UnDeRB055,not working and no support,"Dance Central doesn't open. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times but still doesn't work. All other games work just fine.

Play beatsaber, its a million times better and you know when you do something right or mess up unlike this game which tells you very little.

This Game is perfect for that. She absolutely loves it which fills me with Joy.

2022-05-28 13:36:20.080471,Thriller9,Dancing games in VR are another thing.,"I do not like dancing game with the kinect or the wii. But when you dance in VR it's another thing. It's really immersive and push you to dance on the tempo of the musics when you score more moves. You're being a part of a crew et interact with somes PNJ , the playlist of 30 songs is good. Love this type of VR games, i want more.","Apr 19, 2021 at 4:57 AM",5, 14,

Love this app because thats what I'm doing again..dancing  dancing  dancing.  Yes I'm an OG and now my knees hurt but I'm still getting down.  This is better than all the other apps I'd been using for exercise because its more fun.  Should've gotten this two years ago.  Highly recommend.","Feb 6, 2021 at 2:17 AM",5, 21,
2022-05-28 13:36:23.251083,SwaDorgk,I recommend wear headbands!,I played for about 3 hours. I wish there were more songs. There should be a DLC to add more different dance clubs in this game. Maybe like famous clubs around the world (especially with Covid-19 going on). It's a nice escape to dance within an immersive environment. Besides the Lounge being a place where I can move around...you should apply that to the whole game in general even if it's just to explore a little and taking some selfies here n' there.,"Nov 25, 2020 at 3:07 PM",5, 51,
2022-05-28 13:36:23.266043,DrRenars,Fun and simple dancing,"It's fun. Simple as that. However it would be even better with some kind of story driven progression system to unlock songs, difficulties, characters and maybe even new rooms to dance in. Instead it's a sandbox with all things available from the beginning (excluding some clothes) with just a grain of story. Is that bad? No, but gives an impression of just a minigame.","Jan 11, 2021 at 5:29 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 13:36:23.281003,MdArtz,The Original Dance Central Feel,"I remember playing the first Dance Central on my Xbox 360 Kinect. I spent hours playing that game, and while the second and third games were okay, this one really brings back that joy I felt just dancing in my living room as a kid. It's just so fun. I just wish there were more songs. Super fun, love the new art style. Would definitely recommend!","Dec 18, 2020 at 6:10 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 13:36:23.295963,RomoRudolph,Brought back the feeling of clubbing,"If you're anything like me and miss the clubs being open, GET THIS GAME! I Initially wanted something fitness related and ended up watching a great review of this game. THEY WERE NOT WRONG. Not only is it a great workout, the dancing is so well thought out and its actually takes a good amount of practice to get good at the game (you even have to close fist, point, throw peace signs to get perfect). The game runs incredibly well, and getting to know the characters is such a sweet bonus. PLUS IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK!! Great job devs, you killed it with this game :)","Dec 6, 2020 at 8:49 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:36:26.394294,user045,Fantastic Immersive Atmosphere,"This game is fantastic because it's very immersive and well built. You start off in a queue with other characters chatting around you. The ambient noise feels real. The care and attention to interface and visual style is second to none. For example, you use a phone to interact with everything in the world so you know whats going on almost immediately. The characters even text you and chat adding more realism.

There's plenty of songs and you can meet people from all over the world and dance with them. You can also move around in the room where you meet people. If dancing with real people is not your thing there are plenty of virtual characters to dance with. Each with their own character, look and feel. The game enables you to exercise while having fun and burn off lots of calories if you are into fitness.

The thing that impresses me most is the hard work, thought care and attention that has gone into this game. Developing in VR is fairly new and this game really has a polish unlike many of the other games out there. I'd highly recommend this if you enjoy dancing and exercise.","Sep 5, 2020 at 7:33 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 13:36:26.410252,MrWhitehouse,Multi Player is a Headache Unsolved,"I purchased two of these games for two separate headsets for one reason and one reason only, to dance battle with family members and friends. Now, I can choose to dance battle anyone in the world exept the people in my own house. I managed to get us both in a private lounge, but there are no options to start a match once we both get there. I looked for countless sources for reviews or walkthroughs to see if I was maybe doing something wrong, but there are no sources available. There are also no reviews that seem to be dealing with my same issue, which is to me, very odd. Someone please help me out, otherwise I will be pleading for my money back because there's no other purpose for me here.","Sep 4, 2020 at 4:25 PM",1, 11,"Hello MrWhitehouse. We're sorry you're experiencing this issue. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game? When you're in the multiplayer lounge, do the screens in various corners of the lounge have tasks for you to complete to start a song?"
2022-05-28 13:36:26.425212,Menithal,Great Game but half baked spectator exp,"Fantastic for getting to the rhythm and dancing. Innovative, but simple interface which gets you straight into the action from the go. I can definitely recommend it for the solo experience.

However, the MR support is half baked and there is no support on discord for that. It seems to have been completely abandoned in dev support, relying on help from the community, who have not used these features recently. So for Party / stream situations its less of a recomendation.

There is no option to smooth out spectator camera to be something more tolerable for streaming or for show casing the game spectators, especially if one does headmovement with their dances. 

It would have been great to stream or show case this game further with show casing something different from Beat Saber or the like.","Sep 9, 2020 at 11:01 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 13:36:26.440171,AlainaHatsune,Dance Central on a new level!,"I've always loved the Dance Central games since they first came out! I can't even imagine how many countless hours I played Dance Central. Like I seriously played it all the time.

That being said, when I saw that there was a brand new one, and that it was remodeled for VR, I was over the moon!

I LOVE the feeling of playing this game! It really feels like I'm just dancing with someone at a club, and that we slowly became friends! Not only do I have a blast working up a sweat while playing, but I also absolutely LOVE the ""dating-sim"" style of bonding with the characters (it's not a dating sim though, it's just friendly)! The little nuances really make me happy to dance with each character. :)

I'm just a little bummed they took out some of the other characters like Glitch because he was one of my favorites.

As a dancer and an avid rhythm game player, I do wish some of the songs were a bit harder, but I still have a blast with the game anyway!

I'd really like more songs obviously, cause I can't get enough! (Maybe even with some kpop like you guys did with 2NE1's ""I'm the Best"" that one time??) And I'd love it if I could initiate fist bumps and high-fives with the characters before dancing with them more often, cause I really like that little mechanic. :)

Either way, I'm so glad Dance Central is back!!","Jun 23, 2020 at 2:19 AM",5, 21,

This game is an enjoyable break from destroying blocks with light sabers or punching orbs with gloves and lets me 'unwind' a bit.

Went to start game again, game does not go past the logo screens. Does not work. Tried reinstalling oculus, the game and even contacting Devs but no response.","Jul 24, 2020 at 2:33 AM",1, 0,"Hello Issaspon, have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game? Also be sure that all of the permissions that Dance Central asks for upon first-time launch are approved. Let us know if this helps."
2022-05-28 13:36:29.585900,Fairawen,I Can't Explain How Much I Love It,"I'm a dance and rhythm game person. I played DDR in the day, I play Beat Saber daily. And while I love Beat Saber dearly, this game tops it.

Especially during COVID-19, I can't tell you how cathartic it is to feel like I'm joining my friends at the club and dancing together. My first time playing I was sore as heck, but I had to have one last dance with each character to ""say goodnight"". Best kind of immersion.

Can we talk about the characters for a second? Because they're brilliant. I feel like they're my clubbing buddies, and I've never felt connected like that with characters in any VR game before. When I get texts from them, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. And dancing with them is just perfect.

Two things I would plead with the developers for: more songs, and a further story and interactions with the characters. The second one is a weird request, and I can't say how far the interactions go because I haven't been playing the game that long yet, but I'd love personalized getting-to-know-you depth for each character, and maybe some sort of special location/event/challenge you unlock once you get a high enough friendship level with them.

In any case - devs, thank you for all your hard work with this game, and I'm beeeeeegging for more. Whatever it is, you put it on the store and I'll buy it lol.","Apr 26, 2020 at 12:13 AM",5, 32,"Hey Fairawen! Thank you so much for your awesome, kind words. We're so glad you're loving Dance Central."
2022-05-28 13:36:29.601857,Headfullofclouds,Fun onna bun!,"I've tried quite a few rhythm games in my time. Beat Saber is great, for example. But Dance Central is the one I keep coming back to. The music selection is great, and consists of well-known popular dance and hip-hop numbers from 70s funk through to current(ish) chart toppers. I play it daily for exercise - it's one of the few forms of exercise that this exercise-averse person doesn't have to force myself to do. The fact that Dance Central assesses your dancing performance mainly through hand motion is quite helpful for me - it means that I can modify other aspects of the dance movements to suit my needs. If I want to not perform jumps and hops because of a sore knee, no problem; likewise, if I want to add a bit more exertion to a dance routine by upping the energy of my movements and adding extra vigor to my leg and body moves, that's just fine as long as my hands are in the right places at the right times!

The only real negative I can find is that if you're in Australia, forget about the multiplayer ""Lounge"" component. The lag is so severe here in Aussie-land that the server (presumably in the US?) doesn't even recognise most of my dance moves. How can I score ZERO for a dance routine that I'm actually dancing? Even if I were doing it badly, I'd still score something. One or two seconds' lag makes it impossible to participate usefully. I would REALLY like to see this problem fixed, but since I've seen lag like this in other Oculus VR multiplayer games, I assume it's an Oculus problem and  beyond the capacity of the game devs to fix. A pity.

Oh, and I'd love to see more DLC content! I've purchased the half-dozen or so DLC songs and really enjoy them; more would be excellent!

Summary: I love this game to bits, and it's fabulous as a motivating and enjoyable daily exercise routine. Pity about the multiplayer lag in Australia, but I suspect there's not much they can do about that. Still, even just as a single-player game it is WELL worth the purchase.  Recommended!","Jun 4, 2020 at 8:03 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:36:29.616817,foresterr,"Awesome, but I really miss one thing","It's really great, but I wish there was an optional mode to just get into the club and start dancing to whatever is playing (and also see what's playing!). Then keep dancing to whatever the DJs throw at you, as long as you want (or until they hit the song you absolutely cannot stand, then you whip up the phone ;) ). Maybe your dance partner could be changed once in a few songs without player input, too. You'd feel more like you are just going with the flow of what's happening in the club.","Apr 19, 2020 at 9:39 PM",4, 22,

2022-05-28 13:36:35.880329,syclonix,Better than Beat Saber!,"As much as I love Beat Saber and my custom songs, Dance Central is AMAZING. If you remotely like to dance (even if you're not good at it), pick this game up. Yes, some of the songs can be challenging for beginnings (like me), but not only is the game super fun regardless of how good you are, it also TEACHES you how to dance! You can practice the dance moves step by step with a virtual coach and you can isolate the moves you want to practice as well as slow the speed down to get the technique right. 

It is SUPER fun in it's own right just as a dance game—you feel like you're really in a club having fun dancing with other ppl. What makes Dance Central great is the selection of music from big name artists across pop, hip hop, 70's, 80's, 90's music and onward. The dances are also really well choreographed and fun to learn.

The tracking was spot on. I used it as a exercise routine. Here is a little different thing. I'm aware of worse tracking but it's still good exercise software  to keep you moving a little bit (it tries to move all your body but main focus are mostly hands). The library of music is large and diverse and new moves are nice too - you feel good playing it and that's most important. Selecting new song is fast so you never waste time for waiting for menus etc. I'm glad that Harmonix has released a new Dance Central game and it's still alive.,"Nov 12, 2019 at 2:18 AM",5, 4,

I almost solely play VR games that make me move, I've played nearly all Rythem\Dance VR games out there, and have hundreds of hours in Beat Saber. So I thought, lets try another game that has me dancing and moving like nobody is watching!
Well, It's no comparison. It cannot be explained in words, but Beat Saber just makes you feel like you're Inside and truly a PART of the music. Dance Central has you mimicking, mostly subtle movements, of an AI avatar in a very repetitive fashion. The amount it has you moving is laughable compared to Beat Saber and the way it tracks your ""dancing"" by just 2-3 data points doesn't help. I gave it time, trying a selection of the lackluster songs the game provides, but instead of feeling into it, I just felt like it was a chore.

2022-05-28 13:36:45.358781,webbedjoes,This is the most fun I have had in VR.,"I absolutely love this game. The complete immersion with the club setting and a mobile phone with friends you talk to is on another level of realism. I genuinely feel emotion when interacting with the people in this game! The dancing is super fun and one hell of a workout, and there are two options for dancing: Standard or Pro. At the moment I've been dancing on standard and i've been having so much fun but it's great to know that when I feel like it I had a whole over set of dance routines to get 5 stars on!

The character development is awesome, and you get to choose who you favour more. The more you dance with a certain individual, the more respect they have for you and the more connected you are as a friendship. It's actually amazing.

I don't want to finish the game, as I know the new learning aspect will be over so I am praying for ongoing DLC and updates to keep this alive for when I inevitably finish it!

If you are comparing this to the Kinect games you've played previously, don't. The total immersion and feel of this game is like no other. If you're hesistant, I believe it's rather cheap for what the game is (It comes with 30 songs with two choreographies!) and you wont be dissapointed. If you also want motivation to sweat like no one's lookin' and get some excerise, this game will have you tired and exhausted after a good hour of play! (That's if you do the dance moves properly ;) )

Overall such an amazing game and I can't wait for future updates.","Sep 16, 2019 at 2:01 AM",5, 21,

2022-05-28 13:36:45.390696,LoopyChew,"Two steps forward, ? steps back","I've been a fan of Dance Central ever since Naoko demonstrated the game at the Kinect announcement and I'm happy that there's a new iteration of it at all. The song selection is wide-ranging and the DLC, limited as it currently is, allows you to spice it up as you like. The VR experience, which immerses you in the titular club, is enjoyable, and the characters are full of personality as always.

Using the headset and controllers as motion detectors is both a stroke of genius and also a hinderance. Obviously Harmonix had to make do with what they had and they definitely made the most of it! However, given that the only points of reference for motion tracking are said devices, and as they have to account for the fact that some of these devices are wired, they aren't allowed to go as buck-wild as they were in the past with the moves, and you can get away with a fair amount of foot missteps as long as you're moving in rhythm with the beat.  Having a dance game where you only have to kinda dance along with the choreography makes for less of a game.

Still, when I'm playing VR games, this has become a bit of a daily driver, so obviously I can't complain too much. The game has enough personality (side note: I preferred the old character designs to the new ones, but I'll live) and fun factor that I'm more than happy to come back to it time and again.","Oct 24, 2019 at 7:16 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 13:36:51.713938,Yoshirosama,Dance like nobody's watching (Literally),"*Reviewed in an Oculus Rift CV1*

Dance Central VR for Oculus devices...what is there to say?...aside from being an Oculus exclusive, this game is pretty good!

Harmonix took the core gameplay of the Dance Central games that were originally designed for Microsoft's Kinect and applied it in VR. The result ends up looking pretty similar to Just Dance on the wii, holding a controller, but instead of being 1 controller with only an accelorometer, you now have 2 controllers, both with gyroscopes and positional tracking, allowing more precise movement and accurate results.

If you wanna get that high score, you gotta learn the songs. You got 2 difficulty levels: Standard and PRO. Standard is the basic one, with basic moves that repeat far longer and are pick up and play. PRO is the difficulty where if you enter unprepared, you'll get obliterated (By the character that is dancing better than you, you don't get physically obliterated). To dominate PRO routines, users will be required to visit the studio to practice the moves related to the song (It can take between 10 minutes to 30 minutes to learn a whole song choreography and dance it well).

Game comes with 32 tracks, and 8 additional remixes of the 32 tracks. DLC is available starting today but is totally optional. 

If you wanna dance, and even stay fit, get this game. The price tag might be high, but the time spent in this game is worth it.","Jul 19, 2019 at 1:58 PM",5, 13,

Hopefully we get the option to get more songs down the line. Even better if we'd be able to add our own because I feel like the dance routines, except a few that are obviously from music videos of the songs themselves, can go with any other song so there wouldn't be any need to worry about syncing them to match the song.","May 23, 2019 at 1:36 AM",5, 61,

But the choice of Avatar is stick thin or obese?
If your figure had changed as you levelled up, that would have been a nice touch as calorie counter thing, e.g. your figure changes over the course of hours played on regualr basis.
Customisation is generally thin on the ground, hopefully this will be added free rather than microtrasactions (nothing worse than charging for cosmetics in game), particularly when compared to like of Rockband 3, etc.

If the Customisation is fixed, via new content / unlocakbles, then this will be a solid 5 star (90% game).

If you're a fan of Dance Central, Harmonix, or music rhythm games in general, then this game is a must buy. It is better than I expected given the limitations of the Oculus Rift (or Rift S or Quest). DC 3 will still be the best version of DC given the full body tracking of the Kinect, however, this iteration is amazingly good and the choreographers did a great job getting around those limitations and making you feel like you're out on the dance floor. Great routines, good music track list, & nice visuals & sense of immersion being in the club and dancing the night away.

2022-05-28 13:36:58.055649,Behonkiss,A great series gets a great revival,"I loved the original Dance Central games. For me it was the one good reason to own a Kinect.  The death of that accessory made me sadly assume the series was gone for good, but I was happily surprised to see Harmonix resurrect it for Oculus.  

And as it turns out, they've done a really good job adapting the series' core mechanics for VR.  The gameplay remains fun and exhilarating, the characters and world retain the charm and personality from before and make use of a fun social connection/smartphone mechanic, the soundtrack is fairly large and satisfying, and sensor accuracy often feels more on point.

Not everything's a home run, though, particularly when it comes to presentation.  Online multiplayer mechanics are sometimes confusing, avatar customization is pretty limited, the character roster is slim compared to the previous games, venues aren't as varied visually, and I'm not big on the new art style (Aubrey and Mo in particular look very strange now). The song list is in desperate need of an additional difficulty as well - it basically feels like you have Easy and Hard difficulties when Normal was my main playstyle before. Some of these feel like they could be addressed via patches, but others are likely hear to stay.

Still, Dance Central remains a blast, and has jumped ship to Oculus wonderfully.  The $30 price tag may seem hefty, but you're getting a lot of songs for your buck, and if you've never tried the series before, this is a great place to start.","May 30, 2019 at 6:54 AM",4, 8,

2022-05-28 13:37:01.170907,Pinworm45,"Fun, but a bit lacking as a game","To start, the core mechanics of dancing are fun - copying the character in front of you, and doing their moves. I'm about as far from a dancer as you can get, but it's still enjoyable for me.

However, while the core gameplay is fun, there's not a lot of game surrounding it. There's a few locations and characters, going to a location essentially unlocks a character and location that you can dance with. You get reputation by dancing with them. But this doesn't really do anything. There might be cosmetics or something - honestly I haven't looked - but I feel like there was room for different modes, different mechanics, things to do. There kind of isn't.

Also, the game looks really nice visually and stylistically, but I find the characters you can dance with obscenely ugly. It's hardly a deal breaker but it's almost like they did not want attractive partners to dance with. Something about the look of them bothers me. It doesn't really matter but you do spend a lot of time looking at them.

Also, I'm not a HUGE fan of the soundtrack, but I don't really dock points for that as it's a dancing game so it should have dancing music, which generally isn't the style I like. I can still mostly enjoy it, except some songs. I wish there was a bit more songs I'd like as I do like some general pop stuff but it is what it is.

Anyway, it's fun to dance along. If you like the soundtrack all the better. But there isn't a lot of meat to the game. I am excited for future updates though. I just wish there was more stuff in general.","Jun 13, 2019 at 9:33 PM",4, 3,

As for the issue with language options, there seems to be an issue with changing languages when Display Scaling is enabled. It's a little strange and we are still investigating, but hopefully this workaround will allow you to change the language:

To disable Display Scaling on Windows 10, do the following: go to Start -> Type ""display settings"" -> Select ""Change display settings"" to bring up the Display Control Panel. Ensure that ""Change the size of text, apps, and other items"" (under ""Scale and layout"") is set to 100% and not higher for your displays.

After doing that, try launching Dance Central and changing the language. If you can successfully change the language, then you should be able to revert back to your preferred display scaling and the language will stick with your saved game."

It is so easy to lose track of time. The only problem I’ve had to deal with is my headset’s tether getting in the way at times. I will have to get a wireless unit one day. 

As for changes and alterations I would like – a calorie counter would be nice. I would also like more options when it comes to editing my avatar. Especially the face.

Bring on the K-pop!!!","Jun 14, 2019 at 2:28 AM",5, 1,
