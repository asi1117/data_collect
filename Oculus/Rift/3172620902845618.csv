They aren't consistent. 3) Player names must be re-entered after each game. The same goes with resetting PVE vs. PVP. 

Looking forward to any other features and environment options than the 2 that come are in place now (obstacle play is a nice add). Also looking forward to some form of high-score or best-game saving.","Nov 25, 2020 at 5:08 AM",5, 3,"Thank you for your opinion!
