2022-05-28 16:40:48.140106,ShawnyBee,It's OK,"It's well put together, but ultimately short, simple. The puzzles are basic, only a few environments, and make little use of being in VR. Only buy if on sale. Otherwise avoid.

Additionally I actually enjoyed the first more than second.","Jul 24, 2019 at 3:00 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 16:40:48.155066,datarez,"1 is passable, 2 is pretty good actually","For around 3 hours of playtime, both games as a whole turn out to be pretty fun. Esper 1 is pretty light and has a couple frustrating puzzles. 2 has more enviornments, more entertaining banter and pretty solid puzzles. Outside of the 2 bad puzzles in 1, I'd say overall the puzzles were maybe too easy overall. It's a fun collection though, especially if you catch a sale.","May 28, 2019 at 7:00 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:40:48.175013,Amuny,the VR Portal you were looking for,"Esper 1 is a fun and short game, but mostly a demo for what's to come in ESPER 2. This is so far one of my favorite puzzle game (with I Expect You to Die). It's simple, funny, and the story is just enough to keep you entertained. The voice acting is hilarious, and I simply loved every part of it.","Jul 31, 2018 at 10:32 AM",5, 4,"Hey Amuny, thanks so much for the kind words about Esper: The Collection. We enjoyed creating this series for both Mobile VR and of course Oculus Rift, thank you for playing."
2022-05-28 16:40:48.200943,rh_galaxy,Paid $3.34,"Worth it even not on sale I'd say, good voice acting, good humor, thought through and working puzzles and nice transition animations.
Esper 1 was good, Esper 2 even better and lasted longer.","May 2, 2018 at 2:18 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:40:48.214906,Oboema,,"Fun to play and if your have finished, take a look at the cryptic achievements you did not yet earn for some replay value!","Mar 11, 2018 at 12:01 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:40:51.333565,AlexLen,,"Second part ok with different invironments, first part boring with anoying narration.","Feb 15, 2018 at 8:22 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:40:51.348525,jamyjet,Fun little game but bugged achievements,I enjoyed the first Esper (haven't played the second yet) but I noticed that the achievements are bugged/don't seem to work. Any updates on this?,"Feb 12, 2018 at 9:42 PM",4, 1,"Hey Jamyjet, there are no achievements in the original Esper, the system was added for the sequel. Hopefully, that clears up any confusion. Enjoy becoming an agent of ESPR in the second game, good luck!"
2022-05-28 16:40:51.363485,4dy1972,,was good but now great with the touch support.. as good as vr gets,"Feb 7, 2018 at 4:38 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:40:51.379442,RScullion,Fun but limited,"It's an interesting puzzle game and the sense of humour keeps it going, but I'm not sure how much VR adds to the experience. I expect you to die does it better.","Apr 1, 2017 at 3:56 AM",4, 5,"Hi RScullion, thank you for the kind words and your feedback. Happy to hear you enjoyed Esper: The Collection."
2022-05-28 16:40:51.394402,chaugi,Esper 2 is great,"Esper 1 was interesting but after dozens of missions get borring as you are always in the same room. Yes audio story is nice but a bit boring.
Esper 2 is more story driven therefore more interesting. Does not get borring at all. Well I wish there were more mechanics like in I Expect you to die. Touch support would be great as well.","Dec 25, 2016 at 10:31 PM",4, 3,"Hey Chaugi, thank you for kind words and feedback. We are happy you enjoyed your time with Esper: The Collection overall!"
2022-05-28 16:40:54.528021,Drowdragon,,The gamemechanics were a bit difficult sometimes but i've got to say this has been an amusing experience especially the second part. The characters are endearing in their own way and the story is comedically clichee and witty. Hopefully more of them in future and maybe with touch?,"Jan 20, 2017 at 4:36 AM",5, 1,"Hi Drowdragon, thanks for the kind words and we are so happy to hear you enjoyed your experience with Esper: The Collection"
2022-05-28 16:40:54.542981,AngelOfHonor,WOW.,"oh ho ho..... this game. this game right here. this title if by far one of the best vr Experiences out there. when i first bout this title, it only came with ESPER 2, but ever since the release of the full collection, there hasnt been more laughing, gut busting, secret finding and acheivement hunting fun than there is right now. this, ladies and gents, is the portal one and two of VR. a MUST HAVE STANDARD for any VR user. i greatly encourage coatsink to make a 3rd installment! :)","Nov 17, 2016 at 9:50 PM",5, 13,"Hi AngelOfHonor, Thank you so much for this glowing review.
