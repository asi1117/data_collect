2022-05-28 15:38:23.753435,jingojenga,Absolutely amazing,This game is a fine work of art. Controls centralized and easy to read/understand. Gameplay is both broad and indepth with variations of missions/modes. Teamwork makes this game shine but you can find quite a lot of enjoyment solo as well. The atmosphere is amazing from being inside the sub to outside on deck the sounds/vibe are spot on. Really love this title just wish I had friends to play with. Someday...,Apr 27 at 6:54 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:38:23.768395,wadebehr,Love the game but a few thoughts,I love this game but it would be nice if you could upgrade the deck guns and the torpedoes (other than just having more of them). Also it would be nice to name your own sub instead of having one generated for you. Lastly having different options for subs instead of just the one. I enjoy my time with this game and wish I new people that also have it to try the multiplayer aspect of it but as it stands its a great game thus far. trying to get to the dock from the military zone when you are out of torpedoes does get very boring quick since your just basiccally sitting there waiting for the other boats to get past you unoticed. I get it that is part of the immersion. However when you do get past them and return to the Map oten times the game spawns more ships right on your location forcing you to do it all again. this often just makes me want to surface and fire my deck gun at the destoyers until they sink me in a blaze of glory just so I can get back to enjoying the game again after starting another round.,Nov 5 at 4:26 PM,5, 7,

2022-05-28 15:38:23.797318,navets2020,Excellent game! My goodness!,"I am a huge fan of Uboat the movie and Greyhound. I decided to look for sub games and found this one, instantly bought and my goodness. I am trying to buy it for friends to join me! I love it! Being able to also get points by destroying ships to upgrade yours was just an absolute bonus! Must have and please continue the great work! Totally recommend! Oh and also AirLink works perfectly!","Jun 22, 2021 at 9:01 AM",5, 11,
