2022-05-28 18:41:25.675347,WarrenS,Its nothing new but its not bad,"Classic wave shooter with a time reloading system. I did run into an issue where I shot one of the blue orbs that slows things down right as the wave was coming to an end and it was turning red, and instead of being slow for around 15 seconds as it should be it was slow for the entire time until I restarted.

Aside from that one freak issue I think its a fun game but again its nothing groundbreaking","Apr 14, 2018 at 12:33 PM",3, 3,

On the surface this is just another wave shooter, but underneath lurks a strategic shooter. One of the main mechanics that makes this game stand out from the other wave shooters is weapon management. You are only allowed 4 weapons at any one time and you need to choose which ones to take into battle with you. One of the key mechanics of this game is ammo conversation, each time you empty a gun you need to place it on its pillar to re-load, this leaves you open to attack and also means you need to pick another weapon to keep back the horde.
Weapon tracking and handling is spot on, graphics are slick and the environments are well designed.
I only managed to see 1 of the 4 time zones in my initial play-through and this is featured in my video, and I would highly recommend you check out the games trailer to see the other zones, which feature Robots & Dinosaurs etc.
As a fan of this type of genre I will certainly be going back to finish it as it has a certain charm.
