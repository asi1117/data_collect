2022-05-28 16:41:34.685614,GunterTimeLord,Awesome Co-op Game... No Cross-buy?,"I love this game, and yes, you should get it if you want a fun asymetrical co-op experience. I play it with my daughter frequently.

My big gripe is that there's no cross-buy with the Quest 2, which puts a sour taste in my mouth, as I've paid $25 once, and while I love the devs, its weird to have to pay again to use it on the same device I've been using it on, but with the ability to use other computers.",Oct 20 at 1:32 AM,4, 4,

2022-05-28 16:41:34.745453,taquitobuddy,Good puzzle platformer coop,"My wife and I didn't really enjoy this ourselves, but it is a decent puzzle platformer and one of the few VR games you can play with a non-VR person, so extra star for that.  Decent game overall, just not our cup of tea.","Jan 2, 2019 at 6:25 AM",3, 9,

2022-05-28 16:41:37.913979,rbkay78,Completely unique,"I purchased this with the idea of having a game that my son and I could both play at the same time with the rift and this one fit the bill.  Great cooperative game, not terribly difficult puzzles, but just challenging enough to keep it entertaining.  You can't get through this without communicating and working well as a team.  Kudos to the developer for breaking new ground with this, fantastic concept and well executed!","Aug 9, 2018 at 11:12 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 16:41:37.927941,OmiCron07,Refreshing experience,"I almost never write reviews, but this one deserve it. Very cool game mechanics. Played maybe 2 hours with girlfriend and we love it. Not 5 stars because she thinks that the controls of her character (she plays on the screen) is a bit off and she did a few suicides because of the constrained camera, but not much of a big deal. All maxed out graphical settings with an AMD 390X.","Jul 30, 2018 at 7:38 AM",4, 12,"Thank you for the nice review!
Did you try to inverse the camera in settings? We've noticed some players don't realise we have that setting and struggle with camera settings that are opposite of what they want."
2022-05-28 16:41:37.942901,theregoes2,This Game Is Awesome,Really good Puzzle-Platformer for when you have a friend over and only one VR headset.,"Sep 3, 2018 at 11:53 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:41:41.064552,JoeKsux,Amazing Couch Co-Op,"This is an amazingly fun game. Really good puzzles, and the asymetry adds a unique style of game play that requires true co-op between players. Most puzzles have things that are only visible to each person. So you have to have an open and active dialogue between both players to effectively beat each level. The only reason I'm giving this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of a consistant framerate dropping that were are seeing. After playing a few levels with the game running flawlessly, the framerate will tank and stay tanked until the game is exited and relaunched. Normally I would say that it's an issue with the persons PC not being able to handle the game, but I'm running an i7 7700K w/ 16 gb of dd4, and a Titan XP gpu. This is the first VR game to give me any issues. When this issue is resolved, I'll happily give it 5 stars.

Edit: Changing my review to 5 stars. The issue I was initially seeing seems to have gone away.","Jul 11, 2018 at 6:01 PM",5, 9,Thank you for the review! Could you send a mail to johan@oddravenstudios.com so we can work with you and find the reason for your issues?

2022-05-28 16:41:41.108435,tacomcca,Best Local Coop experience,Been playing with my SO and having a blast. The puzzles in this game force the players to talk with each other to solve many different types of challenges. I would reccommend this game to anyone that has an xbox controller to play with.,"Aug 25, 2018 at 3:17 AM",5, 2,
