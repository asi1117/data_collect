2022-05-28 20:03:36.842191,FritzTheDonkey,For Amateur And Professional Alike,"What? You don't know how to paint? It's not hard. You can stream your favorite paint along in the app!  Need more of that color you painstakingly mixed? No problem! Just smear it around and it never runs out! Don't have time to finish that painting? It's okay! The paint won't ever dry out on you! But, what if you do need that layer dry? Don't wait! You can do that too! Want to paint, but don't feel like all the clean up? Not an issue! Just push a button and it's done! 

All the physics feel spot on. The paint reacts with the brush and canvas exactly the way you would expect it to.  Blending colors is an experience in itself. On and off the canvas, you can watch the most beautiful hues and shades come to life.  Every brush stroke can be seen, to inspire and add to your creation. No mess, no cleanup. No additional costs for supplies. Heck, it costs less than a single quality brush. Seriously, if you love to paint, just want to relax, or have some good ole fashioned art therapy, then stop procrastinating and buy now!",Mar 25 at 6:24 AM,5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:03:36.856153,MermaidLullaby,An exceptional painting app!,"Vermillion is an amazing painting app! It aims to reproduce real life painting in terms of utility and feedback, but it has such a friendly tutorial for beginners that almost anyone who can use a Quest can paint along whether you have experience with painting, or not. The dev is friendly and engaged with their community, and they have a lot of plans for the future, including pencil/charcoal, multiplayer and more! (And the more people support them, the faster we can get these! :))

It's Quest/Rift cross buy, so you get the native Quest app and the PC version in one purchase. The native Quest version has a lower painting resolution, meaning swapping in-progress canvases between the Quest and PC may lead to some differences in brush strokes, but you can transfer palettes and paintings between the versions pretty easily. :)",Mar 28 at 9:15 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:03:36.871113,AGL1,worked initially.............,"............now just crashes.  Shame because it looked fantastic :(

Update: Deleted then re-installed Vermillion now working well :)",Apr 7 at 2:02 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:03:36.885608,sergdooddarsh,Must Try!,Not a painter? No problem! This will make you feel like you could cut your ear off and make a ton of money off your paintings! AMAZING AND FUN!,Mar 25 at 4:42 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:03:36.900541,Toran_Cult,Fantastic Bob Ross style paint program,Please add multiplayer so we can paint along with friends beside us or do painting classes.,Feb 11 at 3:32 AM,5, 13,"Hi! I'd absolutely love that, and will do my best to implement multiplayer this year. Multiplayer is very complex though, and I'm just one guy, so bear with me!"
2022-05-28 20:03:39.996854,FragMaster31,Beautifully crafted painting simulator,"Absolutely fantastic!  Painting in this program feels extremely natural.  You can tell the gentleman that developed it put quite a bit of thought into the details of painting with oil.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star, is simply due to the lack of environments.  It would be nice to have more to choose from!  It would also be awesome if there was a way to squeeze out our own paint on to the palette.  Tubes of paint!  There is always room for improvement, but I must say, this is by far, the most authentic experience I have had to date in VR.  It's amazing in every way.

I also experienced trouble with the in game browswer (something I was really excited to check out).  It simply doesn't work how it should.  Anytime I try to log in to my Youtube account (through the game browser) to do tutorials, it says I need to try a different browser, yet I am able to view the default tutorials.  It's weird.",23 days ago,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:03:40.012320,KnightMason,"Great painting, Minor flaws, Active dev","One of the best natural paint simulations I've found regardless of VR or flat screen. I'm happy to see that this doesn't fall victim to the VR ideology we find in other VR apps where they imitate real life at the expense of practical use. Like not having a basic undo. Rather, this is a true bridge between real life and VR. Shows why the industry will continue to grow and bring more advantages to established real life skills.

There are some real frustrations however...

For example there are only 4 layers which is helpful enough, but no basic layer functions like layer merge.
I do understand that it is intended to give the idea that your paint is dry below it and doesn't mix with your new top layer.
But real life painting is FAR more versatile than this.

Because in real life, we can wait for paint to almost dry into a sticky state, easily paint over it and mix other colors without mixing below it, and THEN blend with the paint below. Which is what merging layers would simulate. And that doesn't exist in Vermilion.

In real life we also have unlimited amounts of drying we chain together. When is a painting ever really finished anyway? Not that we need unlimited layers or anything. But 4 is rather small.

In real life, we can also paint over slightly dry sticky paint as mentioned above, and then dab a drop of thinner between the two colors to create a bright smoothing effect.
A commonly used oil trick which gives us bright glowing highlights. But that doesn't exist in Vermilion either. At least not yet.

Thinner only mutes the colors in Vermillion. Which is correct if you use too much of it. There is no subtle techniques found here. Which is what makes oil painting all about the oil, and how it interacts with itself.

That said, this is still a very useful application for simple styles of painting in oil and is actively updated by the developer. If nothing else, it is a great way to get an under-painting to finish off in other applications.",Apr 8 at 8:28 PM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:03:40.027280,tacomcca,VR magic,Once you get used to the program you can paint along side Bob Ross. When you get lost and are just enjoying painting it can be a magical experience. Kudos to the developer and I can't wait for more updates and the Q2 release.,Nov 4 at 2:35 AM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:03:40.042240,razorwind421,Very complete and fun !,"The Workplace is very practical, you have a decent set of tools, and the ambient sound set you in the mood !
The layers management and the embeded browser is smart !

If only we could have bigger canvas available it would be perfect !
PS: i am aware of the resizzable canvas, but i dreamed about very big pieces ! =D
Maybe there is a technical limitation to this ?
Ratios are also limited right ? And more further shape (circular of triangular canvas) would be mind blowing, but i could imagine how difficult it is to implement, so maybe one day ! ;)",Oct 2 at 2:41 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:03:40.057200,coppermine,Set's the bar high.,"I  own a lot of creating programs, it is the field where VR shines the most (in my opinion).  All have their good and bad points and all have their varying levels of difficulty and need heavy time invested to get yourself good results.  Vermillion has come along and changed the way that users can instantly pick up and use a piece of creative software.  Quite simply this paint program is absolutely fantastic.  Anyone, and I mean anyone can get to grips quickly and simply to obtain genuine beautiful landscapes in a few minutes.
 
Obviously, the more time spent, the better the results will become. It's still a big learning experience after all.  Not only landscapes, but detailed paintings can be created for those with a more artistic flair.  Vermillion is the painting program that can show non VR users that VR creation is no gimmick, if you can paint in real life, then it will transfer to the virtual canvas.

I was lucky enough to have been part of the Beta and even had one of my recommendations implemented (pallette size adjustment) and the many updates have made it better and better.  The future is very bright for The Aviary.  As the title says, Vermillion has set the bar very high for other creators to try to reach.  It is to other VR painting software what HL Alyx is to other VR games.  It will continue to improve (all software must), but this is in great, talented hands and will go from strength to strength.. Just get it.",Aug 2 at 5:08 AM,5, 35,
2022-05-28 20:03:43.188947,naspdep,Would buy again,"If you already have a VR headset, and you want to learn how to paint, you can do the math: You could buy an easel, canvases, brushes, and more and more paint.
Or you could buy this.
I'm not a painter myself (yet), so I can't 100% compare it to real life, but I really like it.
There's an in-game browser, which is somewhat limited, but it allows you to watch youtube videos, which is neat if you want Bob Ross to teach you how to paint mountains.
You can also view pictures in  said browser. (On PC: Open the image in your normal Browser, copy the URL, then go into the game and click the copy-paste symbol on the in-game browser). 
Even better: It has an overlay function, which allows you to project the browser onto the canvas. So if you want to draw a sketch first, do that, scan it in or make a photo of it, then open it in the in-game browser and click overlay. 

Also, Vermillion was developed by one guy, in his spare time, as a passion project.",Aug 21 at 11:10 PM,5, 14,
2022-05-28 20:03:43.204905,BigBadShark,WOW! So amazing!,"I am a professional watercolor artist and I have been learning digital art but it is challenging to convert to a different style.  This program is so true to life I couldn't even finish the tutorial before I had created a beatiful piece with ease.  I don't like oils IRL because of the smell and upkeep, this program has given me a completely new appreciation and respect for oils but mostly, allowing an artist to adapt to digital art with such fluidity and ease. I love this so much, thank you for creating this.",Sep 3 at 1:52 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:03:43.219864,joeKster,"Fantastic, unexpected obsession","I was just browsing the oculus store and the name intrigued me, so I watched the trailer and then saw the reviews and I was like, wow….this looks legit.  I used to watch Bob Ross as a kid but never really got a chance to try.  He made it look easy, could I technique my way into something decent?  My wife is going to think I’ve lost it for even trying (because my art skills are up until now laughable) - but I thought if I didn’t like it she could try it and probably would like it at least.  So why not, it’s only 20 bucks or so.  If nothing else it’s a good showcase “game” for when people come over and try VR.  - next thing I know I’m devouring YouTube tutorials and paint-along videos,  and seeing everything in a different lens.

It’s just a fantastic way to try something you may never otherwise ever try, the developer is very responsive and helpful and the discord community is active and encouraging.",Aug 29 at 6:33 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:03:43.236819,funnywheeno,So much better than I expected!,"I don't know how you did this, but this is digital painting redefined! I just caught myself trying to scratch the inside of my ear with the back end of my brush! 
Not sure what else there is to say...

I'd love to be able to set different / more realistic / custom background, but as far as the painting experience is concerned, I have not much left to wish for except for a hardware upgrade that gives me a higher resolution, and a pencil would be nice. Looking forward to water color =o). And some of the round brushes don't deform well when pressed against the canvas. I hope that gets improved over time, too",Sep 1 at 6:00 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:03:43.250782,hargisss,Just buy it.,"Vermillion is miles ahead of the competition. Wildly amazing. It's a very detailed simulation, at a level which feels more physically real than anything else I've experienced in VR.

Plus it won't ruin my cloths or furniture!",Aug 21 at 11:36 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:03:46.343134,TTaoGaming,Relaxing,Fantastic and amazing experience. Wish there was more options to adjust how the knife and brushes function. However at of this moment I already immensely enjoy this app.,Oct 4 at 12:22 PM,5, 0,

2022-05-28 20:03:46.388013,AaronCar41,"Yes, it really is that amazing.","Vermillion is exactly what I was looking for in a VR Painting app. It's stable, thoughtfully designed, and capable of creating actually works of art virtually. The Internet integration makes it a breeze to find how-to-paint videos or a cool image to trace. Thank you!",Aug 31 at 10:13 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:03:46.402973,Bakkensota,what if,haven't touch it yet. Random thought - change the canvas size's on the aisle. Draw giant works instead of the tiny canvas.,Nov 26 at 11:23 PM,5, 0,
