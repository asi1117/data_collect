2022-05-28 19:48:15.376764,RuneSR2,Way too repetitive,"I really wanted to like this game, and made with Unity the performance was great - even forcing super sampling 2.0 fps were solid 90+ on my GTX 1080. The music and explosions were nice too (especially the music is great). But the gameplay is way too repetitive - the developers need to impress players within the first minutes, not to drag them through hundreds of the exact same enemies attacking in much the same way. Gyruss was one of my favorite arcade games, sadly this VR game is so far from my beloved Gyruss - and other great old arcade games - that I'm not able to recommend Gearus. The devs need to thoroughly redesign this game. For a few bucks less you can get a *much* better game like Voxel Fly - and for a few bucks more you can get Space Pirate Trainer and/or Xion, which both are incredibly much better than Gearus, unfortunately.","Apr 20, 2019 at 6:45 AM",2, 3,
