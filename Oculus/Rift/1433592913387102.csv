2022-05-28 17:30:10.559209,storm.2.exe,Pretty Cool,"ESPIRE is a sci-fi shooter game where you take the place as an Australian agent controlling a robot called Espire.

Pros: Pretty fun and has cool features/mechanics. Variety of weapons and hand-to-hand combat. Game is...sort of replayable? Fun climbing and shooting. Also there are ""challenges"" that you have to do before ascending to the next mission. It places you in a random map that you can select and you have a objective to complete before you can leave. (Hostage Rescue, Gathering Intel, Elimination, Climbing, etc.) Anyways, Pretty good game.

Cons: Super glitchy. Like, SUPER glitchy. There are countless glitches that I have experienced that I can name. (Game randomly going to menu screen while playing, hand stuck outside wall, falling outside map, score glitches in challenges mode, guns disappear from holster, etc.) Some features don't work when being initiated sometimes, too. It was a pretty good game nevertheless.

ORIGINAL: After 3 missions, they force you to replay those missions to unlock the next.
If a game is good, you replay the missions by leasure.

2022-05-28 17:30:10.589129,agentplaza,Awesome game!,So I started playing this on Quest before I for the cable for the Oculus Link. The amount of detail was I great in both but this is another level. Like the sparking tiles and just everything. There are so many ways to solve things and I keep trying different solutions and that makes it even more fun. It’s my favorite game and I keep working my way though it and just love solving things in so many different ways. Great buy - highly recommend!,"Apr 12, 2021 at 8:25 PM",5, 15,Thanks AgentPlaza for the kind review. So glad you enjoyed the game on both the Quest and the Rift!

2022-05-28 17:30:13.737707,Manydoors,Very good stealth game.,"Better than I hope it would be and quite imersive.  The graphics are pretty good, not stellar but good. The controls are very nice and unlike other games your not fumbling everything.  The climbing machanis is one of the best I have played.  You get the feeling of climbing without getting your arms in a tangle and falling down.
I would have liked a better tutorial, most of the time I don't know what i'm suppose to do.  The AI get's annoying as it keeps repeating the same stuff , it's as if the records stuck.  Also, is there no way to silently kill the soldiers so as not to have them wake and sound the alarms?
All in all, one of the better stealth games that is very playable and a lot of fun.","Nov 29, 2020 at 11:14 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 17:30:13.767628,kf2010,Average shooter with some bugs,"This is a pretty average shooter. Though it is marketed as a stealth game, it is quite easy just to go gung ho and shoot everyone to complete missions, and this is on hard. The AI is poor to say the least, with little rhyme or reason to their movements. There are also a few bugs where you get stuck even though you have done everything and a restart fixes these sort of situations.
On the plus side, it is smooth as silk on my Quest 2. 
Overall, this is a solid 3 out of 5 or average for me. Been there, done that.","Dec 27, 2020 at 7:15 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:30:13.781591,KRS-ONE,"Good potential, poor execution","I love the overall design of the game; climbing in VR games is a soft spot of mine. The ""future"" tech is cool as well, the hand cameras, telekinetic belt slots, force grabs, all of that, but that's about all the game's got going for it. The stealth aspect, or at least the detection system, is probably the worst I've ever seen. Most games, e.g. Payday 2, notify you that an enemy is starting to see you and give you a chance to get back into cover; Espire guards are immediately suspicious and start heading to your position if they see so much as your big toe. Also, grabbing and moving things, like bodies and props, feels like I'm playing VRChat; you're able to carry everything one handed and nothing has collision with a carried object.

The game can be fun, and I understand that things are changing due to the fact that the game's still being updated, but in its current state it's still quite rough.","Sep 12, 2020 at 8:48 AM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 17:30:16.856366,ThornyBlades,Could have more content,"It's crazy fun, but if you are looking for a really long game with alot of story, this might not be the place to go. I personally care most about gameplay, and if you do too, I'd reccomend you to buy this game. I'm just asking the devs to add more missions, and maybe instead of making espire 2, they should make another storyline inside of this game. And with the ending, i think it would be cool to have a human body go into the base instead of a robot. And you take more damage and can only heal at certain rooms, so it encouages the player to be alot more stealthy, because with the current state of the game, you can brute force your way through the entire game.","Aug 5, 2020 at 1:11 AM",4, 45,
2022-05-28 17:30:16.871326,Sgtpjwinkels,,Honestly the game was fun and had good gameplay.. My only issue with the game is the lack of play time.

2022-05-28 17:30:16.900249,DarkGuerilla,Meh.,It works but seems like a rushed project not worth the price tag. All of the objects except bodies and guns can not be moved around.  Glass doesn't break when you shoot it and/or you can't shoot through it. The turrets you face are completely harmless and the enemy AI can't see more than 6 feet in front of them. It also feels like the systems AI voice could have used a bit more work.,"Aug 14, 2020 at 10:53 AM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 17:30:20.043841,BLOODY.DOOMWOLF,Its great,"Not every game is gonna be perfect. Option to what device you want to have your mic come threw would be great. I plug my mic into sound card. This way I can record sound and mic commentaryy while on PC with link cable. This is the first game I bought for quest. Many questions. What could you add? Taking someone hostage and moving them to a dark corner would be interesting. Shooting out lights, having light and dark areas. Hiding bodies in closets and such. If it can still run on quest wirelessly great! This will be the go to game while traveling for sure.

Earning in game cash. Buying weapon stuff I can see happening. Randomized levels with enemies with everything I said above would keep things interesting. Even several difficulties.
""Development team"" I would add angle adjustment. This way I can hold my controllers and aim how I see fit not the game. Also smooth weapon turning adjustment. Not to copy anyone but. I play wardust with link cable and they have those options it's great.

For those looking for a review to weather or not to buy this game. That really depends on you. I been gaming for 19years and I have yet to get motion sickness from a VR game. First time it's weird. however the headset hurts after a while. This game I would recommend if your looking for a good quest game. There's plenty of options to customize the rotation and feel of the game.","Jul 10, 2020 at 1:06 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 17:30:20.059798,superdave132,Great game with too much pressure,"I love this game, Its excellent design and gameplay that feels completely polished but the only issue I have is with the timers. They make you feel rushed and stressed. This is mostly a stealth game which you should be able to take as much time as you need to get to the objective. There should be an option to disable the timers to make the game more enjoyable for longer amounts of time. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.","May 8, 2020 at 3:20 AM",4, 179,

2022-05-28 17:30:20.090715,taquitobuddy,"Lots of content, not enough polish","Pros:
-A solid amount of content, and also variety of content.  There is a main campaign and then also a good number of challenges with lots of different goals.

Cons:
-The stealth features just aren't very good/realistic, but I don't count this too much against them because no VR game has anything even remotely close to realistic stealth that I've played.
-The body slots/grabbing weapons/ammo/etc. is all incredibly janky and needs to be redone.  It is just plain bad, not even amateur quality.
-Gunplay isn't very satisfying overall.
-AI is quite poor and extremely unrealistic.  


Overall, if you really want to play a VR stealth/combat hybrid game, this does have a solid amount of content so catch it on sale.  Otherwise, it has too many major issues to recommend.","May 26, 2020 at 1:50 PM",2, 15,

2022-05-28 17:30:23.271209,ajaswinski,ALMOST GREAT,"The physics are actually a lot better in person than you see on reviews. Graphics are fine. Biggest issue is pretty much the concesnses: for a stealth game, it's not very stealthy. There's no moments where two guards meet up and talk for a moment while you can sneak by, eg. It's really just duck and cover. The tranq gun is very cool, but you're always spotted too quickly, even on normal setting. A lot of the set pieces are very similar. I also have an issue with the save system as if you don't make a certain mile marker, you have to really go back. Finally, the biggest issue is thematic. I don't feel very cool being an AI bot. Would have been better to just been a human operative with some kind of enhanced bio tech that made me feel more of a personality. I'm still waiting for AAA stealth but this is one of the better ones by far.","May 23, 2020 at 3:08 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 17:30:26.384881,Rousteban,Hmmm  mm mm  mmmm mmm,"Let me start with- it's really good, it's a good game. Let me continue by saying it needs getting used to. It's not Metal Gear, and it's not Splinter Cell either, that being a positive thing. I'm bothered by some of the ""VR"" design aspects, design that opts for comfort over realism, I was expecting something a bit more grounded in reality I suppose. However- Once you do get comfortable with it, it really does take you with it. You're forced to make quick decisions at times depending on how you approach the moment and this plays very well to it's advantage. The traversing gives a wide variety on how to tackle patrols. The AI is pretty basic but keeps you on your toes, I've seen far worse. Soundtrack is good, but far too repetitive to keep on once you start putting hours in. Visuals are a bit oldschool, but clear and not totally ugly, I'd assume it's an update away from looking ""real nice"". It has great moments, and I imagine good replay value too, and while the design is corridorish, you do get a vivid sense of freedom in how to move about and the way you play, be it ghosting, CQC or outright liquidation. 4/5 for a few reasons - it's not ""there"" yet, and has probably hidden potential. VR has it's limitations to balance out it's possibilities. That in mind- I would like to adore this game and praise it, and I kinda do, I'm having a great time, somehow I just wish it had some deeper gameplay elements and wouldn't rely on the repair tool to do ""stuff"", but that is subjective, it's a game and plays like a game, it hits it's marks and hits them real well too. But I've not played it through yet, so I dunno, maybe that 5th star is lurking around the corner. This probably won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time, but it does mop the floor with many competitors that have had exponentially more time and money at their disposal. You should own this game; I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.

(To dev response) - Looking forward to it! You should be proud.","Dec 27, 2019 at 10:00 PM",4, 23,
2022-05-28 17:30:26.400838,Hamsteroidz,Ok game,"Not the best VR game. It's similar to splinter cell or metal gear solid but a kinda poor attempt in my opinion. It was fun which is why it gets 3 stars but a lot of aspects missed the mark. You can climb on metal objects which sounded really cool at first until you get into the usually really dark environments and can't tell where you can and can't climb. The guns work well except It's a learning curve trying to grab with your second hand because you usually take the gun out of your first hand. My other big concern is movement with enemies. sometimes they find you behind them on the ceiling and other times your 2 feet in from of them and they won't see you. Holding up the enemies was cool until I realized it has no purpose except a little bit of ammo. You don't have a knife or anything so you just punch them and hope the body doesn't get seen. Intel or extra items or upgrades or SOMETHING would make it worth it but by the 3rd mission I've just started shooting them cause there is no difference other than they can't wake up and fight me anymore. An execution would be cool but you just don't do much for the effort it takes to sneak behind them. Like I said, fun game when you can see but not quite on the mark. 3/5 would maybe play again but probably not reccomend for purchase.","Jan 13, 2020 at 10:39 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 17:30:26.416795,Wirebrain,Metal Gear Solid VR,"The title says is all. Not as deep as MGS maybe the it's the closest thing we got in VR. The stealth is great, if you prefer to go blazing guns and bullet time it's also great. And the game feel comfortable even with all the comfort settings turned off. It's not perfect, but then, VR is far from perfect yet. Based on where we are with the technology it's a solid VR experience. 

It's early Christmas for VR owners!","Nov 23, 2019 at 5:24 AM",5, 93,"Thanks so much for your review! There's still plenty we can do to improve the game.

2022-05-28 17:30:26.432753,mikey.heckel,The future of VR is in good hands!,"I have an oculus quest, so now officially playing both on quest and through Oculus link, let me just say: WoW. It definetly captures the stealth aspects, and I'm very proud of the developers. They delayed it multiple times, and it really shows. The game is fantastic. It truly feels flawless, the only thing I don't like right now is the calibration and where your weapons are located. It feels kind of wonk.

FINAL VERDICT:
If you were a fan of Splinter Cell or in the market of looking for a stealth/action game, this is for you. The concept of the story is fantastic and everything feels very fluid in this game.

2022-05-28 17:30:26.447713,Wunderbear,Very nice,"Loving the combat in the game. I particularly appreciate the left hand mode as some games don't even consider it. (I'm looking at you DOOM VFR). Bit hard to position guns and reach them, but I'm sure over time this will be sorted. My main issue is with the Vignette. Please tell me how to turn it off altogether. Believe it or not it makes me feel sick. If I can't turn it off I'm afraid I'll have to refund the game, which I really don't want to do. All in all a very polished game although I've only played about half hour I can see the effort that has gone into it! This is the only game I've ever been able to do the stealth part as it is spot on. If I can turn off the Vignette I think this will change to a 5/5.","Nov 23, 2019 at 8:50 AM",4, 41,"Hi, Thanks for your review! To turn off the Vignette, pause the game, go to SETTINGS -> COMFORT and disable the ""Comfort Mode"". Sorry this wasn't clear.

Click the 3 '...' on the bottom right. Click ""Details"". Now, copy the ""location"" from the menu that appears. use Windows Explorer to navigate to this location. Try launching the Espire 1.exe from windows Explorer. Hopefully this will launch the game without the Oculus Home App. Potentially it will work."
2022-05-28 17:30:29.594297,rwoodr,Fantastic stealth game!,"Very much enjoyed the roughly 30 minutes I have played of the game so far. I turned all of the comfort settings off and have been feeling super immersed as a result. Has a very splinter cell vibe to it and being able to physically crouch, peak around corners, and rotate quickly are what makes VR so special for me. Devs have done a great job with the game. The calibration function is a little quirky. I would like to be able to physically grab for test items after I set up the belt and chest before leaving calibration so I place them in the best spot. I didn't see an easy way to re-run calibration (could be overlooking it) and ended up having my dart gun and repair tools in akward to grab positions. All in all, would very much recommend it!

The concept and execution are top notch and from my understanding it is a small team with limited budget. What they have managed to acomplish is amazing. Can't wait to keep playing and dive deeper.","Nov 23, 2019 at 11:46 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 17:30:29.610254,EnderMaster101,Amazing game,"This game is amazing and very fun to play. It's stealth is fun and its combat is emersive. It has a great story length, and quite a bit of replayability. The game also comes with quite a few side missions, which are mostly fun, although somtime a touch annoying. The climbing is also quite well done. My main flaw with the game is progression. Most things wern't explained properly, with other voice lines cutting in, or in one case, stoping for no reason. You also have mo way to know where to go, besides a guide that you can see for a short period by crouching down. There are quite a few bugs, ranging from graphics to gameplay, although i beleive the developers are releasing quite a few updates to fix this, along with a few changes that make the game much more fun. I am quite disapointed with mission five, as it is quite shorter then the other levels. The end of the story ends on a cliffhanger, which I cannot wait to be resolved.

I have very good ""VR legs"", like I don't have any motion sickness etc in games like Serious Sam 3 or any other really since adapting to VR. But this game gets me feel bad because the terrible user interface in the game!

Like who had an idea that the tools and weapons should be mounted on your chest and to be front of your vision all the time? To minimize that terrible blockaed you need to do totally opposite than the ""calibration"" requests you, meaning you need to move the controllers as far you can and low you can so they wouldn't be on your face!  And after I suddenly lost first drone, I was back to start but now the chest tools were around my head! Not where I had them calibrated first time, and where my utility belt was exactly as after calibration!

  So as I couldn't perform calibration from the menu, I was required to play from the start to the calibration station to get the repair tool from blocking 40% of my left side of view. Just pure annoying experience!

The game might have a nice story, but I didn't get any of that feeling in the first encounters etc. The script doesn't even sound so interesting and how the people talk to you and to each other just is naive by context. I am not so expecting much from the future of story line. 

But now writing this, I need to recover from horrible nausea, that is caused by the blue visor lines and the ""horse blinders"" that you get when you crouch. Those things just float around and they make terrible feeling as you are not there, you are constantly having something that breaks your vision and your immersion and ""lags"" behind. 

The game doesn't either even apply all the settings you do, like I changed middle of the game the movement from controller direction to HMD direction, and it doesn't apply it (does indicate so), until I restart the game (go menu and press Restart).","Nov 25, 2019 at 7:01 AM",2, 6,

Climbing, and sneaking feels great, theres even places I never thought I could reach! Enemies are decent enough, sometimes they dont react to my shooting in other rooms and escaping them once they are on to you is basically not going to happen lol. I think the price is extremely fair and everything feels tight and replayable. hoping for continued support and patches to keep AI fresh.

My Problem: In order for me to play this game I have to travel through my file folders and open the games file to get it to play, otherwise I am given a ""try again later"" error 9OVR25027186) package failed to launch app (1971014).

Thank you for being a cross buy game with quest, It was one of the main reasons i decided to buy this. It is a miracle you squeezed this onto quest. Ive put a couple hours each on the rift s and the quest and I think you did a great job on the port. I cant wait to show my nephews this game on thanksgiving day!  The only negative things i will say is the AI could use a little polish, and both versions have a weird bug that always cause my touch controllers to appear inside my in game hands. this bug does not happen with theatre mode on, only when i turn it off. Not a deal breaker, but annoying since I would rather play with it off.

2022-05-28 17:30:39.043025,squire_james,Great VR shooter,"Firstly, this is the first VR FPS i have played which has attempted stealth mechanics and it has done it pretty well. The story and gameplay are good, the VR-mechanics are good and intuitive; this game makes excellent use of motion controllers for immersion. Graphics are good, not the best, but solid. The belt and holster adjustment is new and I liked it very much, I felt getting tools and weapons was faster because of it. The only slight downside is the AI for the enemy units is not great. However, this does not break an otherwise great game.

Another strong positive is that whilst it does offer features for comfort, it doesn't force them on you. Having played VR a little while I find I do not suffer from motion sickness and I want to play FPS games in the most immersive way currently available - stick movement coupled with real / stick turning with no snapping/teleporting or vignetting. This game fully allows me to play that way, awesome!","Dec 10, 2019 at 6:14 AM",5, 4,

It takes a little to get used to, but all working really well for me. Reloading, I love how you repair omg, dragged bodies, used machine gun, open snuck through vents. I'm serious I am pretty impressed, this was all on the rift. I'm excited to try wire free and standing maybe on the quest, using real crouch too!!! I was playing seated and fake crouch ( button a for rift s ). 

Great first impression and am excited to play more!!

Of course like most games, I think the AI could be better and smarter. I mean they were easy to kill and when I got damaged ( few times near death ), if you back out one room and repair, no ones tries to leave their room and follow :( :( 

AI realism and behavior and logic need to improve. Hopefully that is something they are planning even. I just hope the game takes off and sells, so they can keep working on it, pretty awesome game.","Nov 23, 2019 at 2:47 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 17:30:39.089899,Pethu91,"Best VR game i played so far, GJ devs","I never write reviews. But this game.. it deserves one. I have been totally emerged, being stealthy, retrying the same parts over and over again just because I think i can do better! So many nice ways to finish a encounter. I just want to find the most satisfying way to finish an enemy off all the time im playing. The story is interesting. Keeps me guessing so far and im just losing track of time. I even fell over trying to hold myself against a wall. Soo emersive!

Only Bug i found/encounter so far is the grip on the 2 handed guns. Tracking isnt too great and aiming becomes harder that way. 
But so far. i have not really bothered. The most fun way to kill enemy's is sneaking up and shooting them right in the face, looking them in the eyes, using slow-motion-smiling while doing it.  That being said, 

PLZ DEVS KEEP MAKING THIS GAMES, so I can buy them and give you my money!!!","Nov 27, 2019 at 5:21 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:30:39.105857,ParadiseDecay,Metal Gear meets Splinter Cell!,"My Initial Impressions:
A fantastic stealth action game that puts you in the shoes of a robotic assassin.
This game has great production values and an impressive array of weapons and tools at your disposal.
My only gripe is the AI enemies are a little too easy to defeat or get past, I would like to see an option to turn difficulty up.
But, on the whole a great game with hours of fun.

2022-05-28 17:30:42.204569,Singland1,Really good Stealth Experience.,"Brings me back to the time of the first three Splinter cells and Metal Gear games.
After tuning the settings, turning off the comfort settings and applying smooth turn, This game immersed me almost at the level of Lone Echo, which is still at my top VR experiences, though this game comes very close taking the spot.
So far, played for around/over two hours and I am having a blast with the game!

Grab onto anything metallic or a ledge to climb up, or if you have to reach a place somewhere high; grab the nearest rail/wall and launch yourself high in the air! This part is one of my favorites, the freedom of movement in a stealth game!
And it makes sense! you're controlling a robot after all through this ""neural link"".

More ways than one to get past your enemies or stealth knockdown them!

Cool collectible weapons you can search for in the levels and unlock them as starter weapons for later levels!

Making the belt/chest belts adjustable AND injecting them into the story progress was a very good idea, other VR games with systems like weapons/gadjet belts should do this too because people come in many sizes.

Voice acting is pretty good; to put that into words it was something i noticed when it was weird but never got bothered with.

Interactivity! You can grab Almost anything not bolted down or that does not weigh a ton.

So far a very pleasant experience! Will update this review once I've completed the game, with all it's challenges beaten and badges collected.","Nov 25, 2019 at 7:14 PM",5, 6,

Espire 1: VR operative aspires to be the best in VR stealth games to date and it pulls it off well. 

It's graphics are OK and will do. Nothing more nothing amazing. What it lacks in colourful environments it makes up for in gameplay. 

The gameplay is solid as a snake. Something you wouldn't normal say, but I hope you get the reference. 

Stealth is the main goal. If you go in all guns blazing you will find it very difficult. You can climb to safety, you go into vents or down ladders to basement areas. Many things you can do to evade or stealth disarm your enemies. 

The game is an ace top of the pack stealth shooter that shouldn't be missed.","Nov 24, 2019 at 10:47 PM",5, 6,

This game is the opposite. You have all your abilities on your side and they don't. You get a million ways to approach a situation and all of those choices have their own reaction. Me and my brother are both playing through at the same time (Seperate quests) and we're both loving it so far. It aappears the replayablilty is very large even since I havnt finished the story line. I get Apex/Titianfall vibes like I'm a simulacrum. Very happy with my purchase. Only downside I would say is when you walk/run you have a lowered FOV, however rthis is editable to be almost none.

2022-05-28 17:30:51.657287,jjGuardian,Can't understand the hype,"My first impression was total shock and disappointment. Simple and sparse describes the environment. The graphics are boxy with simplistic textures.
In seated mode it freaks out if you rotate your head left or right which defeats the purpose of a VR headset just because you had sore feet.
The techniques of stealth are all there but the details have issues. Very poor visibility through the hand cams.
I fired a machine gun in the initial hallway and no one from the surrounding open room responded so we can say there really isnt much of an AI.","Nov 23, 2019 at 1:10 PM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 17:30:51.673243,Rogue_m82,Not what I expected.,"The game feels 10 years old. The graphics are blocky, textures are terrible. AI from the enemies is so bad, they don't hear anything nearby and respond. They detect you when you should be undetectable. Objects edges don't snap to the objects creating invisible barriers.

When you move there is an odd blinder type screen cover that leaves you with tunnel vision to look around. Despite the PS2 era graphics the game isn't smooth either, and paired with the visual overlay when you move makes the game hard/uncomfortable to play for long before needing to quit.

Chest and utility belt items are wonky and move into your vision often. Don't stay snapped to where you place them always. Buggy with magazines.

The stealth part of the game is massively hindered by the inconsistency of how you will be detected. Seems like it's very easy to be spotted when hiding but very easy to evade further detection. The dialogue and explanation of story are pretty flat and don't immerse or inspire you.

Pretty much mainly empty levels with easy to kill, low intelligence AI that don't go investigate much so mechanics like the body drag are mostly pointless.

This game isn't worth $29.99. Mostly hype so far. It's a major step backwards for this genre and for a VR title as well. Quest version is missing a lot of polish to both visual and mechanics. Hope it gets better, I didn't return it in time so I'm stuck with it.","Nov 25, 2019 at 10:33 PM",3, 10,"Hi, thanks for your detailed feedback. We're continuing to work on the game and have just released our 1.3 patch which addresses many critical issues that have been reported. Our next patch focuses on AI and improving the graphics on the Quest version. Some notes based off your feedback: There is a DISPLAY menu and you can set the graphics quality to EPIC. You can also enable Volumetric Fog. At this point, we consider the graphics to be better than PS2-Era. The game also has a HARD mode (VR Operative Difficulty). On NORMAL difficulty (Espire Agent) you can run and gun if you want to, on HARD, stealth is really your only option. You can disable the ""Blinder screen cover"" in the COMFORT menu."
