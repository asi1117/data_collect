2022-05-28 13:56:06.620349,Masamune5454,"actually, kinda good","i passed by this many times even after downloading. but i decided to try it agian, and i was pleasantly surprised. since there is no real rts on VR yet, except a few indie cheapo ones, like adopt or perish, (im not counting Brass tactics, Final assualt, Airmech commander, and so on becuase they are all missing a aspect of traditional RTS here or there. you dont build your base anywhere on ground, summon units, upgrade and collect resources ect.) this game does let you build anywhere, has a good number of units and stuff,  some good ol upgrades, and RTS style controls that are simple in nature, such as point and click and hold to expand a circle for selection then move your units where you please. 
So all in all id say it has things i have been dying for in VR. most VR rts games dont let you just build a base.... i do wish i could build walls in this, but i guess you can do that with the turrets or buildings. even more theres bonuses for bulding stuff close to each other, making it different somewhat.
its basic yes, but sometimes thats what you want. i just want a basic RTS that i can collect gold and mine with my red alert 2 style harvesters(this game does lack that, instead its the resource buldings instead) and RTS it up. this game kind of fills those wants even being simple. it would be much better with bigger maps and better looks, some more stuff ect. AI can be dumb. but good job. THATS FOR IT BEING FREE> idk how much it is and i cant tell you if i would pay for it yet.","Jan 14, 2020 at 4:10 AM",3, 44,

2022-05-28 13:56:09.782932,lilcstrike,Petroglyph usually smashes this genre,"All the issues here are too numerous to count. Firstly this whole expereince feels like a sloppy port of the 8 bit series. those games were decently fun but lack the charm of the CnC series. It's just not fun. Base building is boring and strategy doesn't expand beyond rock paper scissors one note units that look very similar. One unit per factory makes for some dull fighting, not to mention, some lazy animations. If you want to see some good units look at Last Day Defense. Plus, way more of that game is free and is a great challenge.

It's okay for a free game, but everything about this experience smells like a lazy cash grab for VR, especialy not from the dev who brought us Empire at War. Until they polish this experience, pass.","Jan 8, 2020 at 11:20 PM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 13:56:09.812852,Uwer123,Why hurt our necks,"You shouldn't play this game because you have to look down most of the game, and for us none experinced players it takes us longer to play game, so It hurts our neck for a longer period of time.","Dec 20, 2019 at 9:44 AM",2, 10,

2022-05-28 13:56:12.972452,KDR_11k,tldr: Boring,"You have infinitely respawning units and fight an AI base that only gets rebuilt, not intelligently expanded. Because that's not a real challenge it's meant to be played against the clock to see how quickly you can win. If competing for quickest times isn't interesting to you then there's nothing to this.

Oh and the controls are extra bad, you have to aim at the board to give orders so placing buildings accurately requires a steady aim or you'll misplace them (doubly bad because they get bonuses if they're exactly next to each other). Controlling units that way is so awkward it's all attack move into the enemy base.","Oct 19, 2018 at 3:40 AM",2, 13,

2022-05-28 13:56:13.004366,dinnerdoggy,Pretty cool but would like to multiplay,"I like the game, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to play with my friend. It says it's multiplayer. I bought the game for that reason. If there's a way to do it it's extremely vague and well hidden. The game should be very clear about how to play it's game modes. Would give more stars if that was the case.","Dec 23, 2017 at 1:21 PM",3, 17,
2022-05-28 13:56:13.020323,HeyJesseAe,Great!,Nice real-time-strategy game. A little disappointed with the UI and the movement around the board. Environment could also do with better scaling.,"Jan 21, 2018 at 10:33 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 13:56:16.103186,MaxwellRodgers,Very good concept.,"It is a very good concept and great use of VR. My only complaint is that the table that you play on is in a flat skybox and when I would look around I would get dizzy. It is a very detailed skybox but still the 2d seems so out of place. If it was a small meshed out room instead I would love to buy it, but at the moment, I just can't.","Nov 10, 2017 at 7:56 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 13:56:16.118145,thekthepthe3,Just what I was looking for,"This is perfect for me. I loved the C&C games back in the day and have been looking for something simular in VR. This is very simple in terms of units, sound etc etc but its great. 

Really shows where the future of RTS games in VR is","Nov 5, 2017 at 4:50 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:56:16.133106,3DeMan,,"A real nice and relaxing RTS lite. Tried the Demo, then bought it. 
Not as complex or polished as Airmec, but a solid title with a real hook. Let's put it this way I bought Skyworlds and was bored out of my skull after 20 minutes, yet I played this all night untill 2am. Go figure.","Nov 4, 2017 at 6:42 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:56:16.148066,DogTailRed2,Okay but controls are annoying,"Game is okay, a typical Command and Conquere type game. AI is a little limited and combined with clunky controls wasn't interesting for me but has potential.","Nov 18, 2017 at 5:33 PM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 13:56:19.321714,kurzonmorris,,"I have only so far played tutorial and first mission and so far its seems good. Kinda lika a cross between old command and conquer and zed. It doesn't need to be in VR but just cause something doesnt need to be doesn't mean its not enjoyable. 

I'd say if you want a VR tower defence and unit control game in the same vain as the web based TD games from 10 years ago then this seems to be a pretty good game. The controls are nothing special point with your touch controler click HQ and select building and then it gets dropped off. so far each unit building builds one unit and then allows you to control them. I'd say this is a solid 3/5 for people who wana play a TD type game but if you LOVE TD and strategy this might push up to 4/5. 

At its current price i'd say its about right, might be a little over by 50p (UK prices) but for £3 its a fun time killer","Jul 28, 2017 at 11:16 AM",4, 12,
