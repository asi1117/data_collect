It's like a light gun rail shooter in VR with more movement options. Perfectly playable while sitting down. I didn't feel very immersed though.

At level 9 I noticed the game wasn't getting more fun. The sideways conveyors were the last straw for me. Most of the enemies and obstacles after level 2 were annoying rather than fun and challenging. At 5-10 € I'd be happy with the hour I had with the game, for 20 € I expected more. I won't be refunding because I feel that there is passion behind this, but at this point I'm not very impressed with the results.","Apr 14, 2019 at 5:59 PM",3, 15,
