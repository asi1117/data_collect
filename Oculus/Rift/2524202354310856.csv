2022-05-28 20:46:51.354841,itsaustingreen,Decent fun but falls short,"Originally, I thought I loved this game thanks to the great graphics and some of the unique level design choices/atmosphere. After a few months of coming back every now and then, I can't even bring myself to finish the game because the final boss fight is so poorly executed it makes it near impossible due to unpredictable collisions. Once it became not even fun but extremely frusterating and out of my control, I uninstalled the game and likely don't have any reason to go back.

This is more just an attempt to turn a half decent 2D platformer into a 3rd person VR platformer, but they fail to really take advantage of any of the camera moves and mechanics that are possible with VR.",Oct 31 at 4:19 AM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:46:51.369801,Loffen8880,Frustrating and not very fun,"Graphics are great, sound is okay, VR-aspect is great. It's a half-decent platform game until you get to about level 5 or 6, at which point it becomes little more than an exercise in frustration. Ironically, the game is called Ven, and the protagonist is a meditating fox. What this seems to hint at, is that YOU also need daily meditation in order to get through it...",Oct 8 at 5:44 AM,3, 1,

2022-05-28 20:46:51.414681,Belgarion666,"Very good VR platformer, but not perfect","This is a very fun VR platformer. The level design is great. Ven character design is cool. While the gameplay is very intuitive, the camera is not that great, as many reviewers mentioned. Also, there's few minor bugs that I'm sure will be addressed with later patches. 
I'd still consider PSVR's Astro Bot game to be the best VR platformer to date, especially when it comes to engaging with the character: Here I can control Ven, but I'm not engaged with his character and assist with level progression. Only few boss fight instances where I actually do more. However, I need to address the torpedo robot fight sequence where the game suddenly becomes beat saber extreme+ level, which is not my gem. I signed for a platformer, not this. This is a good example of what not to do because here Ven suddenly becomes unimportant and the game turns to something else. And this is where I stopped playing.","Jun 3, 2021 at 4:08 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:46:54.492449,Jixal,Missed the mark,"I'll preface this review by saying you can see a lot of effort has gone into making this game, it's not easy to make a game... let alone a VR game. However, in saying that, I found the game to be rather dull, It's lacking charm and the whole world feels cold.
It starts off fun and interesting but then flatlines pretty quickly.
Ven's character design is really good, but then the enemies are awful, they look like they are from a differant game... not sure what happened there. 
The boss levels are really, really bad and the antagonist is really lame and half-arsed, would have been better to not include them.  
Gameplay is often more frustrating than fun, strange mix between super easy snoozeville and then over the top tricky. Feels like the game could have used a lot more polish.
I really wanted to like this game but overall felt like it missed the mark. I don't feel any compulsion to return. Sorry :(","Mar 12, 2021 at 7:20 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:54.507409,OversizeWizard,Very good platformer,"I really like this game.  Very nice graphics, gameplay is good.
Bit like lucky tale and crash bandicoot.

My only issue with this game is the camera.

Like others say, the camera sucks. Can't go backwards.
When you need to go left or right, you have to physically turn around to look and the character is in the distance.

We need a free turn camera, a zoom in to see parts which make playing difficult when character is at a distance.

I was going to refund after half hour because of this but didn't in the hope that they will sort the camera out.

Move too far forward and miss a box, you cannot go back. Camera is on rails.

Also. While you walking in a direction, and turn your head to look around a little, the character moves in direction my head turns.  If I move forward on joystick and turn my head, the character turns too. Can you stop head movements affecting ven??

I've played 4 levels so far, but stopped playing because camera makes it very difficult.its advertised as a sitting game, but you find yourself getting up of chair to have to physically see some things

That's the only downfall to this game.

Hope the patch it and fix it up. But no fixes to date. Hope they haven't just released and forgotten about the game.","Feb 4, 2021 at 4:54 PM",4, 4,"Hello,

My Initial Impressions:
A great platforming experience in VR. I got Astrobot mixed with Crash Bandicoot vibes whilst playing this game.
The Graphics, animations and the level layouts are superb.
The game feels really polished has a good level design, quality graphics and animations so far.
Don't be put off with this being a 3rd person platform game.
If you like games like Moss, Lucky's tale than this game is for you.

All of the Great Reviews are absolutely warrented!
The only negativity I've seen in these reviews is the lack of camera movement.

SWIVEL CHAIR!

The levels in this game are massive, and using a Swivel Chair allows you to turn your body to smoothly follow Ven up, down, across and around these levels and to peer around to see the very cleverly placed secrets.

Brilliant game, brilliant use of  VR. I very much hope to see more from these folks.","Jan 27, 2021 at 2:46 AM",5, 2,Thank you very much for this review! In thursday we will publish big update so the experience will be even better :)
2022-05-28 20:46:57.649006,Mikedude1555,Amazing VR Platformer,"This game has been one of the best platformers I've ever played since Crash Bandicoot, even giving me vibes from it whenever I play. Everything in this game just clicks together, whether it be the graphics, colors, world, character designs, etc... Each level has something new to offer and challenge the player too as it gets harder and harder. This also applies to the collectibles hidden throughout the game that reward you for exploration and risk taking, which I am always one to go for, regardless of how long it takes me to complete even one challenge. Despite the hours I put in this game, it's all been worth it in the end.

For Ven and the Eki in this foreign, but beautiful world, I really love their designs, especially the little ones you have to rescue. Cute looking too. The addition of being able to pet Ven for fun is a good one, because I think it's funny whenever I pet him, along with getting Moss vibes where you can pet Quill, the little mouse in that game. Seeing some of Ven's idle animations were also rather humorous from him playing rock, paper, scissors by himself, to meditating and floating off the ground to then realize he's up in the air. As for world designs, there's always something new, that being environments and/or enemies. This all shows how much to this world there is, from jungles, to villages to even shipyards. All with their own enemies and challenges that keep you on your toes, or on the edge of your seats if you play while sitting.

The combat, interactions and movements here are very good and it's always nice to just destroy the enemies in the game with a few good swipes or jumping on their heads. Some of the enemies can be a pain to deal with, but once you get the idea how to beat them, you'll have no problems.

Above all, Ven VR Adventure is a wonderous experience to any platformer gamers and I highly recommend this to any out there to give it a try, because it sure had alot to offer for me and I really enjoyed this game.","Jan 24, 2021 at 3:13 PM",5, 2,Thank you very much for this review!

2022-05-28 20:46:57.664963,mashdaddycool,Amazing platformer,"This plays and looks amazing. In my opinion best vr platformer on oculus. The level design is week thought out, and you never have a moment when you feel pulled away from the action.  A Must buy. If you've never played a 3rd person platformer in VR you are going to be blown away","Dec 18, 2020 at 2:37 AM",5, 15,It is wonderful to see that you enjoy it! Thanks for the review!
2022-05-28 20:46:57.679923,DUNCAN404,Outstanding Platform Game,"Graphics - Clean, detailed, bright crisp colors,  with multiple textures and layers.
Game Play - Smooth and fluid.

This game takes you on a fun adventure. Each level is unique and offers different challenges. This is a fully fleshed out game that has many many hours of play.","Feb 8, 2021 at 11:11 PM",5, 1,"Hello,

Thank you for review!"
2022-05-28 20:46:57.695881,Wirebrain,Great VR platformer!,"Graphics (5/5) :
The first thing that's noticeable is the sense of scale. Overall the graphics are beautiful. It's just a blast to be in that universe. Every level feels fresh and different. 
 Sound (5/5) :
The sound effects are everything you would expect from a platformer like this. The music is pretty catchy. I found myself whistling the theme by the end of many levels. Even when the songs are less memorable they are still enjoyable. Overall great soundtrack and sound design. 
Controls (5/5) :
If there is a high point to this game, it's the controls. It's super tight. The game is difficult, but you have the tools to face the challenges. If you die, you know it's because you made a mistake and not a bad game design.
Camera and comfort (4/5) :
The game feels pretty comfortable. The camera follows the character in a straight line which works fine for most of the game. It might be harder to do precise jumps when the character is further away or in a certain angle but those issues don't come up often. 
Gameplay (3/5) :
Everything feels very instinctive. The game can become pretty challenging towards the end though. Expect to die often. New challenges, environments and music make every 12 levels feel unique and fun to tackle. Some segments require you to use the motion controllers to interact with the game and these are unfortunately the low part of the game, but they don't come up often and don't overshadow the good parts. Checkpoints between some segments in the later levels feel a bit too further apart and require  you to redo long challenging sequences if you die which can be a bit frustrating. For most of the game though, everything feels well balanced. 
 Verdict:
Ven VR Adventure is a game that has a lot of heart. It's clear the game takes inspiration from Sony's Astrobot but that's not a bad thing. It's an awesome ride from start to finish even without updates or patches (launch version). So it can only get better with time.","Dec 19, 2020 at 1:12 PM",4, 8,"Hello,

2022-05-28 20:47:00.816534,The_VR_Grid,NOT THE BEST....BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD!,"It's a solid 3D platformer (7 out of 10) with a bit of charm and plenty to do but it's not perfect.  Levels can be a little too lengthy, the checkpoint system can be frustrating, jumping can be an issue if you are looking at Ven from an odd angle and the 2D 360 backgrounds look bad compared to the crisp and clear visuals in front of you.   That said, when it works, it works well and definitely echoes what we have seen in games like Astrobot: Rescue Mission and Lucky's Tale and that's great!

2022-05-28 20:47:00.832491,darkl0rd,Good looking and addictive platformer.,"I'm usually not one for platformers, but this is really well executed in VR. It does remind me in some ways of Lucky's Tale, whichI would consider a compliment.
I really feel this game takes VR platforming to a new level. 
The game is supposed to be a seated experience, I personally however found that if you have a little movement room it can be very convenient to get a better look at some areas. On that note, one thing I think could be improved upon is the requirement/dependency of certain angles (having to bend forward to see where you are, or stand up..). This is something that Lucky's Tale did in the ""2.5d"" areas specificially, where you'd move your head down and then get a different angle to see some floating gems for instance.

Anyway, solid title - plays well, looks well, audio is cute and the cute sound samples have actually saved me from throwing my touch controllers through the room after I missed a platform for the 10th time again ;-) 

Do not hesitate, even if you only play it once - this game belongs in your VR collection.","Dec 22, 2020 at 4:46 AM",5, 4,"Hello,

This is one of those games that looks beautiful and at first glance very easy. DONT BE FOOLED the game itself is stunning, The sound track is one of the best i have heard in a VR game but it is not easy and thats the best bit. 
This is a game that will have you rageing and screaming one minute then the next you will be picking up the controllers saying ok just one more turn. 
The devs are very very open to feedback and a number of points that i have suggested have been implemented already. 
The game is Amazing, and well worth the money it wont be one of these games that you finish in a hurry","Dec 20, 2020 at 8:52 PM",5, 4,"Hello,

2022-05-28 20:47:03.960126,gflores999,"Not ""Comfortable"" and Camera kills you","The camera isn't too good.
There are sections where the camera is fixed, you are forced to look at your character from a weird angle, and from too close/far distance.

The sections where the camera moves continuously on a rail gives me motion sickness and wouldn't qualify as ""Comfortable"" for me.

Also I tried to take a shortcut in the first level (jumping on a box) and the camera stopped moving forward... I had to control my character from ridiculous distance and of course died. So you have a follow a very specific path, otherwise the camera will stop tracking you.

Otherwise the gameplay is okay, but the ""VR"" element doesn't bring any positive value. Worse camera control than other platforms, no meaningful use of motion control (gimmicks like fist bump don't count).

Doesn't do anything better than what Crash Bandicoot does on console.
So you are playing more for the ""VR experience"" rather than for the gameplay itself.","Dec 18, 2020 at 1:14 PM",2, 5,"Hello, thank you for your feedback. Sorry that you encountered some problems.

2022-05-28 20:47:03.992041,Dan_Kitty_VR,lived up to my hopes!,"Solid VR Platformer...it amazes me that there are not more games like this in VR, 3rd person is magical. Anyway, the game looks great on my 1070 with quest 2, and controls are good too. If you like platformers, i would recomend this, im having a blast.
Im only at the third stage, but so far the dificulty curve feels nice, not too easy but not too frushtrating either..its nice to have a bit of challange.

TIP: If you are not on a swivel chair or cant turn around IRL easily, enable snap turning of the camera in the settings :)

Devs: I think you have done a great Job, I hope this game proves succesfull for you (it definatly will be when it hits the quest store) so you can make more!

my only feedback suggesttion would be to allow a way for the camera to back track....and I had a thought that maybe to pull off the power move instead of holding the b buttuton, squeezing the right grip would feel better 

Great stuff!","Dec 19, 2020 at 4:06 AM",5, 4,"Hello,

Thats is great to hear! Thank you very much for feedback :). We are  thinking to add this settings to the tablet so camera will can move back. All the best!"
2022-05-28 20:47:04.007998,themerote,Almost solid VR platformer,"I'll be honest I was going to refund it until I found snapturn in the settings. By default the game has a fixed camera that only moves with progression but then I enabled snap turn so now it is actually playable. Still it would be great if the camera always slowly moved in the direction of Ven because if you missed something the camera cant go back, you just have to look behind you which is difficult being a sitting exsperience. I actually found standing better. The good news is there is hardly any motion sickness unlike Luckys Tale and I have strong VR legs. I think if the devs take some ideas from Trover Save's The Universe they could nail the camera options, maybe fixed camera and moving camera where you could flip between then. Also a smaller perspective where everything is miniture, this would be great. Apart from that it is a solid Platformer and as a platform game I actually prefer it to Trover & Lucky so far, I'm a couple of levels in. just sort them painful camera angle out, I need a neck massage, thanks devs lol just kidding, just needs tweaking. Good effort so far. Also I'm glad they didn't try and do too much gimicky stuff like other VR platformers, it's nice to just have a solid platform game in VR without having the player having to multi task with the the character and just have simpler puzzels but more challaging platforming. I really hope this ends up on The Quest, is that gonna happen devs? I was gutted that its only on PC, would be a perfect Quest title, hopefully cross buy in the future.","Jan 5, 2021 at 2:02 AM",4, 2,"Hello,

2022-05-28 20:47:04.023956,SockDP,Fantastic Game! Horrendous camera...,"Ven is a great platformer that takes place in an immersive and dynamic world akin to other great platformers like Crash. This game would be 5 stars but the camera is so god awful I had to take a star away. This game NEEDS free camera motion. You will have to turn on snap turning which helps, but it just isn't enough. Players need to be able to move the camera forwards and backwards at will at the very least. Up and down motion as well would make it perfect. In its current state, the camera ONLY moves forward which causes tons of problems. Blocked sight, no backtracking, having to akwardly look down when Ven is directly beneath you. It is so terrible and if I'm brutally honest, probably the worst camera implementation I've ever seen in a game. Hey devs, I really hope this hits home because you have a real gem here. Don't ruin it with this awful camera. Also I had a bug where I permanently lost tracking on my left touch controller and it was stuck suspended in a locked position halfway through until I completed the level and restarted Oculus. I have never had this kind of issue before with my rift S.","Dec 18, 2020 at 6:08 PM",4, 4,Thank you for your feedback.

Really good to see a great, well thought out, well polished 3d platformer on the rift store. There aren't many games of this genre in vr, and even fewer that get it right..... this definitely does.

2022-05-28 20:47:07.145606,CountGink,Absolutely Brilliant!,"I only just completed the first level; after being turned onto the game by YouTuber Ben Plays VR. It looked right up my street and I had high hopes, and oh boy this game did NOT disappoint.  

It's absolutely stunning, from the beautiful, lush worlds, wonderful music (think Secret of Monkey Island), the controls and level design. It's so easy to jump into and play right off the bat, with a simple tutorial before you start the first level. But from what I've read it gets quite difficult as you go on. I've been playing sat down using the Oculus Touch controllers and it's been such a blast so far. There's a few funky camera angles, I understand what people mean, but it doesn't detract in any way from the game.

If you loved Moss, as I did, this is even better in my opinion, by quite a way. It's got all the fit and finish and loving polish that I've been waiting for in a VR platform game. If you enjoyed Moss and like platform games in general you will love it.

2022-05-28 20:47:07.178518,Lipnox,A flawed platforming experience,"The VR world is hugely lacking platformers, when Ven came along I was more then excited to play the game. I personally felt frustrated by alot of the platforming segments and found the game very repetative. Ven feels in a lot of ways like an out dated game due to the limited mechanics Ven has leading to a this being a very basic feeling platformer in a lot of ways that at times looks great and at other times does not, like the rocks or backgrounds for example. 

Given this is one of the only platformers in VR I imagine fans of astrobot will be more then curious about this game and this is definitely not as good as that one. I still think there is value here and I expect updates to come to fix issues players report, but I think going into it with realistic expectations is essential. 

For me Ven isn't my new favorite platformer as much as I wished he was. He is a cool character but hes just lacking abilities, and perhaps needs some tweaking in his landing speed. Overall I feel the game is a 7/10 experience please check out the video review for a lot more info and my top 5 ways to improve the game. 
Youtube Link: https://youtu.be/qHZOMflbcl0","Jan 7, 2021 at 4:08 AM",4, 1,"Hello,

Thank you for review and feedback!

1. Astro Bot is a great game 
we have no doubts about it. Of course we understand the comparisons to Astro Bot, but Ven is our first production with a team of less than 10 people. We did as much as we could with the content. We hope that in the future the next levels will be more and more amazing and surprising for players (we are already working on it).

2. Enemies - 
I noticed that you didn't use Ven power attack (2x jump and hold attack button) - then all opponents are for one hit and several of them die in range. I think the game slowed you down by not using it. Jumping on their head is not supposed to break the dynamics while running through the level. We are working right now before Steam/PSVR/Quest realase to make changes in hints how to use it.

3. Starting all over again - In next update user can choose one of 3 types of play. 1- Ven will have unlimited lives and there will be more checkpoints. 2- Ven will have limited lives and there will be more checkpoints. 3- Exactly as it is now.  

4. Level design - we working right now on changes for most of the levels. We don't want the player  die becouse Ven is very far away or user don't see where to jump. We hope after changes you will give Ven another try! :)

5. One hit death - Ven have blessing option - we will add this in next update 

6. Power up - Ven have right now one power attack. In the future in next levels we will add more mechanics to Ven.

Thank you again for honest feedback. We want the game to be the best, so we go back to work :)"
2022-05-28 20:47:10.273241,RuneSR2,All dynamic shadows have been removed,"Ven looked totally awesome in the first trailers, but although the final version does look nice and performance is great the game feels mediocre at best. It does not have the fun heart and soul of Lucky's Tale, and Moss feels like 10 times better.
In the early trailer Ven impressed by showing the most awesome and highly detailed dynamic shadows, which really set Ven on a much higher graphics level than other similar games. See here:

Unfortunately Ven feels Questified to some degree, and all dynamic shadows have been completely removed from the game (no way to enable any shadows in the in-game settings), greatly reducing my immersion. 
I'll probably refund and go back to Lucky's Tale, still need to finish a few levels.
Btw, Ven runs great using ss 2.0 with Rift CV1 - or res 150% using Index (Revive). But the game still isn't very impressive - neither the shadowless graphics not the repetitive content. Price is way too high, for this kind of graphics should not be more that $15, maybe $20.","Dec 20, 2020 at 7:50 AM",2, 2,"Hello,

It was an early version game development video and there all always some changes before realase.  Thank you for you feedback."
2022-05-28 20:47:10.290195,Raxe,"It's not in Spanish, bad camera handling","The game has very important shortcomings.

1.- The game is not dubbed into Spanish, so I have not heard anything about the story. In Steam they indicate that the game is in Spanish both the texts and the voices.

2.- The camera is handled very badly. The camera moves too far forward, continually staying too close to the character. To see him, you have to be looking at your feet, it is a very uncomfortable position for the neck.

Games like Lucky's Tale handle the camera perfectly, the camera never overtakes the character. Instead Ven VR Adventure, on many occasions the camera advances the character and it becomes frustrating to lose sight of him because you have him placed just below the camera.

3.- Another big mistake is that the camera doesn't go backwards. If you want to go back to pick up something that you have left behind, the game does not allow it. Again, they should have learned from games like Lucky's Tale, which allows you to go backwards and the camera follows you.

In a game designed to be played sitting down, you cannot make the person in the chair turn their body and turn their head back, because it becomes very uncomfortable. I go back to the game Lucky's Tale, where the camera followed the character all the time and you always had to look straight ahead, since the chairs do not allow you to be turning to follow your character when you move him backwards. And even if you use a swivel chair, the cable of the PC viewers, they get tangled when turning when you are seated.","Dec 19, 2020 at 2:12 AM",1, 2,"Hello,  thank you for feedback.

1. There are no translations because, as you can see, the game is not yet available on Steam yet.

2. The camera always moves in a straight line at a constant speed due to the comfort of being in VR. We are working on more camera modes. 

You really didn't like anything? This is a new title created by a team of several people and we find it unfair to have a 1 star rating. We hope you will consider changing your review after we make proper changes in near future"
2022-05-28 20:47:10.306153,nicolaslobianco,,"First of all, don't expect an Astrobot game because you might be disappointed even though it is obvious that the game got its inspiration from this platform. The graphics are correct but not as amazing as I could expect for a PC game, the textures are not really highly detailed and beautiful and the pictures of environments are just fine (certainly because they will add this game on quest and could not push too much graphics performance which is a pity). The game mechanics are quiet diverse and entertaining but for example in the snake level I had to restart around 30 times from the same checkpoint because I constantly died, not because I am bad but because it is difficult in this game to predict where the player is gonna fall even though there is a little circle below the character, unlike astrobot where you can predict easily because you constantly see a beam below the character. So basically I saw 30 times the same animation of the snake going up and it becomes so annoying and even borring that I almost raged quit this game because at this point it is not fun anymore and a game should be a pleasure not a torture. It would be nice if the developers add more checkpoints , maybe it is way for them to ensure that we spend more time in this game but it is not a fun way. I will update and change my rating if I see some improvements.","Dec 20, 2020 at 8:56 AM",2, 1,"Hello,

Do you download 1.10 version? We added checkpoints to the levels  and snake level should be easer.  You can write us directly via discord and share some footage where you have problem.   

We hope you will consider changing your review after we make proper changes in near future!"

2022-05-28 20:47:13.436779,JoeADB22,Excellent game with some big drawbacks,"Developers already know how bad the camera is. Really need to be able to look at various angles, it really kills the otherwise awesome fun and vibe of the game. Graphics levels excellent but that darn camera, and, should be able to save more frequently.","Dec 19, 2020 at 9:49 AM",4, 2,"Hello, we are working on other camera movments - thank you for patience!"

We are working on it! When update will be available we hope you will change it to 5 star!"
