2022-05-28 19:35:07.379598,nadia_xr,Creator-Friendly VR Tool,"We first tried Ollie when it was in alpha/beta mode and knew it would be a great creator-friendly tool immediately. Our students, K-12 and college-level, have used this tool and love that they could quickly prototype scenes or 3D object layout ideas using this platform. I highly recommend it and especially because the team behind it is amazing and truly trying to change how people create with VR!","Nov 13, 2019 at 8:32 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:35:07.393560,Virtual Patriot,This rocks!,"2 stars really?  This is a great freaking start!  My hat off to you guys!  I know this wasn't easy to create and it's free!  People are so ridiculous!  Just because they don't know how to use something they leave a bad review?  Really?  This is great for animation and it will only get better!  If you are a pro animator or just starting this is easy as cake!  I mean come on folks, it's freaking free!  Give them a break!","Oct 12, 2019 at 7:39 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 19:35:07.423480,brendachen,Makes animating in VR so much fun!,Explaining keyframes and animation concepts to beginners is tedious and can get confusing but this app makes it so easy! I showed it 5 year old family friend and he loved it. He had never animated before but picked it up super quickly and had such a blast. I practically had to yank the headset off of his head! Great work to the developers!,"Sep 28, 2019 at 2:55 PM",5, 11,
