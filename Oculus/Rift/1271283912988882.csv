2022-05-28 19:49:42.088674,bostephens,Controls don't work,Tried to change Y-axis inversion setting and simply could not navigate the menu. It was impossible to select anything and the menu selection was randomly going up/down without me touching the controllers. Being able to use the menus is important - 101 level even. I should've listened to all the other negative reviews. =(,"Mar 8, 2018 at 10:34 PM",1, 0,"We're sorry about this. We're still working on fixing bugs, thank you for bringing this to our attention"
2022-05-28 19:49:42.103635,WebKnight,No Touch Support,"Only left/right up/down apparently works as I can see movement, but there is no acceleration button.  Tried everything.  Not even a in game menu popup to leave the game or check settings.","Dec 29, 2017 at 10:44 AM",1, 1,"Found the bug! Sorry for the delay, it wasn't happening in our game editor because of the way it was set up, but we found it!"

2022-05-28 19:49:42.133554,VRalker,No Movement,"tried with xbox one and touch controllers, the ship isnt accelerating anyway","Dec 19, 2017 at 2:38 AM",1, 1,"That's not what we like to hear.  I'll have a look through and see if I can find the problem.  If you could let me know which ship on which map, that would be great.  Contact us on Twitter @Astrokarts"
2022-05-28 19:49:42.147517,LcTVirus,needs work,im lost in the race. i see you need to fly to the circles. but the arrow points to something else. so im lost. music is not my style. might want to use simple midi files on that so its pleasing to everyone. i know it takes alot to make games and i know your not done with this one. keep the updates coming and it will get better every one,"Oct 24, 2017 at 1:05 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:49:45.270326,Ryguy21,"Cheap, poorly constructed",Couldn't even launch. All my controllers would do was reset my view and change the radio. Graphics were the worst I have seen. Instant uncomfortable feeling when moving around in the chair. Wish I could give it 0 stars.,"Nov 5, 2017 at 6:02 AM",1, 2,"Sorry for your experience Ryguy.  We just updated our game to support oculus touch controllers, it should work with a gamepad though.  We've updated the graphics settings as well with our last revision of Astrokarts.  Hopefully this fixed any/most problems you were having with our game."

2022-05-28 19:49:45.302241,JCat,Moderate Intensity? Don't think so,"Very crude.  Too many selections before you can even begin the game, and skipping didn't help much. Once in space, I couldn't stand the way the ship moved. I've played other space games without a problem, but this made me immediately crappy feeling. Turned it off after flying through 4 ring and it won't be coming back on any time soon. Thankfully it was part of the Summer Sale, but then again,  if it wasn't, I wouldn't have bought it to begin with. Not so thankful for that.","Jun 24, 2017 at 7:49 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:49:45.317201,Jarrod84,Great Space Racer,Love the cockpit view of this game.  The steering is just like flying a quad copter.  Easily the best combat space racer I've tried so far.  Love the music.,"Jun 28, 2017 at 4:03 PM",5, 1,
