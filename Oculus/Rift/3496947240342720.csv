I feel like the game starts a little slow and easy, but after only the first world they become more fun, intricate, and challenging. Every single level look and feel amazing. I havent played a single level that felt reused. Most, if not all of them have multiple paths to beat them, which adds replayablity. The movement feels similar to Echo VR but with gravity applied. Very fun, I heavily recommend.
I have ran into a few bugs., but they were a very quick fix as all I had to do was close and reopen the game. I rarely review games, but I feel like this one is very deserving

TLDR:
Slow start(but becomes better fast)
Great level visuals and designs with replayability
Movement feels similar to Echo VR imo
Heavily Recommend
Closing and reopening game fixes all bugs that Ive encountered",Dec 29 at 8:24 AM,5, 6,

You can never get yourself heading in the right direction and you can't even grab anything on the way down from your fall.  So you have to start all the way back at the checkpoint.  And this is only about 15% of the way through the game, I hate to think how hard the rest is.",Dec 31 at 6:00 AM,2, 1,
