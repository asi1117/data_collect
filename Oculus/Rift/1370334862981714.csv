2022-05-28 18:11:03.416212,littlegodpan,Interactive graphic novel,"Very cool! keep making these! I'll buy them.

This is the best interactive VR graphic novel I've seen so far. 
 I'd add voice over narration to the speech bubbles and a small animation to show which bubble is being narrated. Add some more motion graphics and sound effects. As far as the interactive parts like the tree 'scene' for example. Add some colliders to the objects, like the tree and the lanterns. As far as the Story and the artwork. It's a pretty good story for a first issue but we don't have any context for the characters. I like the artwork of the graphic novel itself. The flow of the panels is easy to follow. Great job! I'm excited for the next issue!","Apr 20, 2018 at 9:30 AM",4, 3,"Dude.  Thanks!  Great ideas, I think you'll like issue two. It's always a toss up with these on how to apply the fast-vs-fidelity brush.  Feels like there's a sweet spot we're spiraling in on."
2022-05-28 18:11:03.431172,Phalangee,Fair/New/Unique/ Well done and next??,"Just as short as regular bi-mensual comic book with about 15 pages this first introductive episode sets you up in an underground steampunk world very similar to The Matrix in a lot of ways. The book is magical so you can litteraly plunge your head into the book to spectate from very close the scene you are reading. You are never actor, you have no influence on the story. For example yo can dwelve into a scene and have a mini game allowing you to participate to the action as a spectator, trying to find out something that the main character cannot. It empowers the reader in a totally new way and it is consequent on your story's experience.

I appreciate that Nanite Fulcrum will is to be first and foremost a story at its core. The only problem I have is that I do not see any news of the next episode coming anytime soon or being worked at so this might be just a VR showcase product. The price is pinpoint for what is I hope now the first episode of a serie to come. If you are nearly interested in picture novels or comics this totally worth a try out.","Apr 17, 2018 at 7:07 PM",3, 1,

The immersive sections had me instantly wanting to learn more about this universe.  I love amazing backgrounds, so I had to check out their website, and Elvis Perry, you set the stage. Thank you and I can't wait for the next issue.","Mar 29, 2018 at 1:57 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:11:03.461092,joedanimation,Fantastic experience,"I was curious to see what a VR graphic novel experience could be like, and was blown away by how immersive the experience was.   First off, you don't lose the feeling of holding a book and turning pages.  And as a bonus, there are panels that you can literally pull yourself into and hang out in that moment for as long as you like.

There are a good handful of short films to experience in VR, but here is finally a new way of absorbing a story that lends itself well to this medium.  With all the hidden objects to collect, and hidden mini game, you'll find it's more than just a graphic novel, but an entire world to discover and explore.  Personally, I can't wait for Issue #2!","Jun 13, 2018 at 9:08 AM",5, 1,Thanks for the Review!
2022-05-28 18:11:03.476052,Rabenschwinge,Future of Comics,"This is no game! This is a visual novel / VR Comic. Many negative reviews are about how they dont know how to play that.... well I tell u: u dont!

Its a virtual comic book where u read and turn pages. The design is just awesome and it has many gimmicks. You can ""travel"" into some of the scenes and look at them in a real 3d environment. Also u have a mini game at the end of the comic. 

This is just one chapter of a hopefully huge story that will release later on. Think of it as a demo version. But already the demo is great. 

And well for all that say there is no tutorial and u dont know how to go on. Thats just not true, everything is explained in a great way.

I played that while sitting. No need to stand here. Just relaxe and read the story.

Only 4 stars, cause its to short^^ very short. Its so awesome... and then it ends.","Jan 1, 2018 at 1:41 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:11:06.606679,hazeriot,Comic from the future,"Really shows the potential of comics in this new medium!  Although it is short, it does a great job of showing what vr can add to a story.   Highly recommend checking it out!","Jan 16, 2018 at 9:19 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:06.622636,Lyonardo,"Lots of cool graphics, but not much more","The idea is that this is a VR comic that you can read by turning the pages in VR.
There is bonus content that you can unlock that is supposed to make the experience more interactive.
The problem is, there is zero character development; the storyline is just an excuse to show off the very cool artwork; and the mini games are implemented horribly. The mechanics barely work the way they're supposed to. And the games don't bother saving your progress. So whatever you might unlock sort of just goes away. Not all at once either. Each time you're sent to the ""trophy"" screen, some of what you unlocked is gone.
It seems they're trying to sell 3D printed versions of the in-game statues you can unlock, for about $150.
Maybe that's the point of all this? 
Otherwise, it's just a bunch of random, unconnected pieces that look very cool in VR.","Dec 21, 2017 at 9:23 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:06.636599,Merenth,Looking forward to the next release,"Highly recommed checking this out, reading comics has never been more immersive.","Jan 20, 2018 at 10:59 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:06.652557,pdhanneman,The Future of Comic Books,"As a 46 year old former comic book collector I was intrigued by this program.  It took a couple of days before I became bored enough to check it out, and I'm glad I did.  First the story and writing isn't my cup of tea or style but the graphics were incredible!  This IS where the next step of comic books can go.  I gave up on comics because as the value (story, art, the hobby of collecting, etc) went down, the price of a book went up.  It just wan't fun or interesting for me any longer, but this is.  It's immersive, the story needs work but the bones are there, and I can even see an angle on collecting if done right.  Therefore I'd be willing to spend -- IN THE FUTURE --  up to $5 an issue, maybe more if you can give me a reason it's worth it.  Of course the story and writing has to (Humble Opinion) improve at the very least.  But the concept and the art is ready to go.  

(Update:  I'd like to make one suggestion.  Perhaps this format would work more on a anthology level [think ""Heavy Metal""] than a traditional single character driven storyline.  In my opinion I think you would have a real viable business venture to move forward with.)","Oct 25, 2017 at 7:14 AM",4, 5,We couldn't agree more.  Thanks for the review.
2022-05-28 18:11:06.667516,thekthepthe3,This is incredible,"This really is the future of comic books. 

I really enjoyed this experience, reading the comic and being able to ""enter"" certain panels is really cool and I like the unlockable aspect (even if I do always miss the first one with that phone throw)

If you release more I'm going to be more than happy to pay for the content :)

Well done!","Nov 5, 2017 at 5:17 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:11:09.752266,brendank13,Groundbreaking!,That word might be overused but in this case it's definitely not!  Honored to be one of the first to experience a 3D Graphic Novel in VR. The narrative experience is amazing - allowing me to go inside the panels of the comic - and the format has so many possibilities for storytelling that it's mind boggling. Loved the bullet mini game at the end.  My high score was 557! The ad for Jigsaw was super cool as well.,"Oct 21, 2017 at 5:10 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:11:09.783183,rchrdcrg,Meh.,"Neat concept that would be amazing for Marvel or DC to adopt, but as far as this ""comic"" itself, it was very short, the story was uninteresting, and the art design is honestly terrible with ugly characters that push me even farther away from any sort of connection with them. Also, the stupid ball-toss mechanic to unlock stuff seemed entirely out of place. Again, great concept, but kinda terrible in the execution.","Oct 28, 2017 at 2:41 AM",3, 1,"Thanks for the review.   btw, if you never hit a crystal you can unlock the figurines just by visiting a panel.  Also, there's a minigame on the last page you might have missed."
2022-05-28 18:11:09.799140,demotricus,Bad,"You, in a room, holding/reading a 2D Book.
& Thats it.
Theres supposed to be a way to `step into` certain blue bordered panels but no actual directions on how to do that. I Lost interest and closed   it very quickly. (Which I had to do by killing the process in file manager, as there are no instructions on how to do that either). The program was stable enough and the lobby room looked ok, but this really does need idiot proof instructions for old duffers like me as I just couldn`t get into the main part of the program, (which is why I ditched it). 
p.s. please don`t use the phrase ""knock your socks off"" in any reply, it makes me cringe...","Oct 23, 2017 at 10:38 PM",2, 2,"Sorry to hear about your experience. Sounds Frustrating.  It also sounds like you had some trouble accessing the main Oculus menu and exiting the application?

FYI if you hit the oculus button on your touch controllers, there is a ""exit to home"" button on the bottom left of the main oculus menu that you can use at any time, in any application.

If by chance you feel like giving us a try again and are ready to exit, look to your left and you will see a large red EXIT sign, just like in a movie theater.  Fix your gaze on this sign and the app will exit once the countdown dial completes.    

Also, it sounds like you had some trouble flipping the pages and did not find the bonus panel hint on page 5.   After you use the A and X buttons to flip pages (there are hints that appear on your hands to guide you) there is a rather large hint that tells you how to enter the panels with the blue borders (it actually stops you from proceeding until you do).  We've also noticed that some newcomers who have not gone through the standard Oculus touch controller tutorials have a difficult time using the grip buttons and can get frustrated when trying to grab an object in VR for the first time (like the book)

Regardless, welcome to VR and feel free to email us at bugs@spiraloid.net and we'll try to get your sorted.  We want you to have a good experience.  Socks or not."
2022-05-28 18:11:09.816095,RingtailRush,"Received for Free, Glad I Didn't Pay","The game is basically you standing in a room, holding a graphic novel in front of you. You turn the pages by pressing a button and there's only like 3 or 4 panels on a spread. Occaisonally you get a special panel where you can enter the world and look at a 3D model or part of the environment. When I read the description, it sounded way cooler than what it actually is. Not a fan of the comic either, which is half the game. Its about the experience in VR but honestly there isn't much here. Pass.","Oct 21, 2017 at 7:40 AM",1, 3,"Thanks for the review.

2022-05-28 18:11:12.909820,zavenous,,"Relatively good graphics (kudos to whoever did the models). Ability to resize the comic was nice touch. Good idea overall.
Currently Free – which is a good thing otherwise reviews would be abysmal in its current status. Relatively interesting but ultimately boring mini-game. Advertisement for a movie present. Comic (it is the main element of the experience) is somewhat out of context and not too convincing (the “scientific” vocabulary was cringing) and tried to deliver too much in such a short amount of frames).
Unintuitive controls; No ability to teleport during most of the experience (the scene with the grass and the dog in particular would have been perfect for that). Bugs such as two sets of hands in some of the interactive panels - the first unlockable not seeming to trigger anything (frustrating in particular as the cell phone that you need to throw doesn’t respawn and is hard to target and only seem to respawn after going to other panels).
Separate comment on the Jigsaw experience - whoever approved this or did the QA feeling the experience was satisfactory should be fired -or put on one of these chairs while at it… ;).","Oct 21, 2017 at 11:07 PM",2, 4,Thanks for the review.

Unfortunately this isn't a great first attempt with a slightly broken, unintiative interface and v. short and not particularly great bit of a story.

2022-05-28 18:11:22.449305,ajb1978,Groundbreaking,"This is what VR is all about.  First-person shooters, physics games, etc. are pretty much expected.  But it's rare to see something that not only uses the medium in an unconventional way, but actually produces what might amount to a whole new meta-media style unto itself.  Interactive comic books.  I'm on board.
One caveat: The bonus panel minigames (toss an object at the blue floaty thing) the throwing seems to be off.  I will throw in what I percieve to be a straight line, such as literally thrusting my fist out straight and releasing the grip, and the ball invariably travels on an upward angle of about 20 degrees.  So I have to correct by aiming below the object, which can be rather frustrating.  But it doesn't detract from the overall experience, since no one is forcing me to hit them all.","Jun 10, 2017 at 11:04 AM",5, 3,thanks for the review!  Yeah the toss mechanic can be really tricky.

2022-05-28 18:11:22.465263,neuro27,Amazing Unique Experience,"Blend of VR comic book, environments, and minigame. Easily worth paying for, but it's free! Beautiful artwork and fun things to interact with. The comic book has motion pictures where if you angle the book a certain way, the image changes. Then you can put the comic book up to your face to enter bonus scenes, which are well-crafted VR environments. The bonus scene with the tree and the moving grass is breath-taking. There's another bonus scene with the main character and I love the little touch of being able to interact with glowing orbs. I played with those for a bit too long. The minigame has you bouncing from bullet to bullet so they join the vortex, allowing you to keep score. I really like how it takes a story and puts you at the center of a pivotal scene.

the mini game was slightly difficult to understand what I was supposed to do in the beginning but I worked it out fairly quickly.

this really lends itself to experimental 360 - my rig is front facing only and there were a couple of times in the mini game that I lost tracking because I was shooting directly behind and had to look for another way.","Feb 28, 2017 at 4:26 PM",5, 2,"Awesome! Thanks so much for this review!  Btw,  in the mingame you can turn by 15 degree increments with the thumbsticks, this makes it so you can ""turn around"" and still face your sensors (our high score is 617), Thanks for diving in!"
2022-05-28 18:11:28.759428,Azazel08,Graphic novel fans rejoice!,The future of graphic novels looks stunning. This free book is a great way to get people hooked. Hopefully the devs keep future volumes at a fair price so that many will be able to enjoy it. The tree scene that you can step into is marvelous. This is a great concept that takes full advantage of what VR has to offer.,"Feb 16, 2017 at 4:02 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:11:28.775386,Cloud-Envy,Art vs Story,"It looks realy good. The text is big, and easy to read. The artwork is CG. Not realy my thing but it looked fine. But the coolest part is the frames you can go inside gives you a closer look at spaces or 3d models. Tho in the end it is a book. As some one who reads a lot of manga, sadly the wrighting didn't grab me. Alot of it felt unnatural and lacking emotion.

It did lockup 3 times for me in a short amount of time. I'll try it again in about a week or so.","Feb 15, 2017 at 3:56 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:11:31.878087,Sakkura,"Decent ideas, needs a bit of work","Advertises controller support but actually requires Touch. ""Pulling"" yourself into the blue panels often doesn't work. And the bullet kinetic energy minigame is not all that interesting. The VR comic mix is intriguing though.","Feb 18, 2017 at 8:25 AM",3, 3,"Oh man, you played the very first build.  Sorry about that, my bug.  I accidentally left the controller support checkbox on.  Yep touch only, although we're working on a controller only mode.   Thanks for the feedback!"
2022-05-28 18:11:31.894044,ak234,"Not bad, lots of potential","Like the innovative idea, the immersion. I think it could be made into a great product. Few things to consider: immersive play needs to be more interactive. I was pretty disappointed when I realized that most 360 scenes are just static pictures. Ideally, the scenes can be played out, and the player can  control the events (doesn't matter 1st person or 3rd). I realize this may require a whole different level of cgi investment (e.g. for walking/interacting people), but it would really make the game light up.","Feb 22, 2017 at 1:40 AM",3, 2,Indeed.  We have updated a bit since you played it seems since after reading your comments we agreed that you were correct so we added little mini games in all the bonus artwork scenes.  Thanks for the feedback!
2022-05-28 18:11:31.910002,Bel-garath,Potential is there,"This showed that this type of experience can work. If I was to rate this on potential, I'd give this 5 stars. However, the story itself was blah at best. Thus the 3 stars. I do recommend watching this once. It's free. The interactive scenes are somewhat interesting. You won't want to look at this twice though until better content comes along.","Feb 22, 2017 at 10:30 AM",3, 1,Thanks for the Review!  Glad you see the potential.
2022-05-28 18:11:31.926956,Silvanesti,Very Enjoyable,This is really good. The graphics and the 3d engine are excellent. i also liked the story and the interactive parts. Can't wait to see what comes next. Definitely on the right tracks here. Recommended,"Mar 10, 2017 at 1:19 AM",5, 2,Awesome! Thanks so much for this review!  We'll try to stay on those tracks! :D

Judge Dredd would rule like this.  And there are some wicked 3D models out there of him too.  Now if only a 3D artist and an indie game dev had a 20 page screenplay and we'd all be partying like it's 2000 AD.
2022-05-28 18:11:35.107449,smithysfc,Nice idea....partially executed,"Its a nice idea, a lot more work needs to go into the individual scenes, and the ability to move around within them would make this a great experience, 3/5.","Mar 1, 2017 at 4:20 AM",3, 1,Awesome! Thanks for the review!  Thanks for the ideas about moving around in the bonus artwork scenes.  In the latest update we actually added some minigames to all the bonus scenes because of feedback like yours.  Thanks!

Seriously, sorry you had a frustrating experience.  Sounds like we failed you.

Hope you find other VR cool stuff.   btw, if you ever play again. try throwing the VR headset at the Nanite Fulcrum logo.  We made it so you could shatter it.  Been thinking about making a little speaker hookup here at the spiraloid workshop so we have to hear it when someone hits it.  like a boo (or a cheer as people manage to find all the figurines...  ;) )"

The presentation is what really puts Nanite Fulcrum over the top.  You literally get to pull yourself into the panels of a comic and interact with the story in real time.  Add in some mini games, trophies, hidden panels and you've got a comic with unprecedented immersion.  

Definitely worth checking out!","Feb 18, 2017 at 2:53 AM",5, 6,"Thanks for the feedback and the awesome review!  We felt a bit like we were putting on a show while building the theater and the seats at the same time.  Glad you like the presentation.
