I have noticed some tracking issues when it comes to the katana games. Specifically, if you move too quickly, the sensors won't slice through your targets. Similarly, there seem to be some issues when detecting the rotation of the blade. For example, in the accuracy training, if the blade isn't rotated quite right, the game interprets this as the flat of the blade hitting the target which knocks the whole thing over. These bugs make it difficult to progress in the game which is probably why I haven't been able to unlock anything except archery and katana. Still, it is a fun game and a decent workout for the arms.",Mar 9 at 7:37 AM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:41:29.903608,Wunderbear,Beautiful,This game is lovely to look at and easy to play. The sword mechanics are spot on. In fact I think they're the most accurate I've come across. The bow mechanics are great and I appreciate the fact that you can choose either hand for the bow and the sword. Unfortunately I couldn't play for too long due to arthritis in the shoulders. But I will be playing it again. As I have nothing bad to say it gets a 5 from me!,"Sep 9, 2020 at 9:20 PM",5, 25,
