2022-05-28 20:09:56.591221,BeatzCreations,"DO NOT BUY THIS, OR ACCEPT IT FOR FREE","Well, in short, absolutely boring, super short, no replayability, voicelines wasnt even synced so if a character said something funny the other players heard something else or nothing at all. 5 weapons, just very very samey, repetitive, stand in this circle and kill the waves which go on way to long, wasnt even listening to the audio.",Jan 14 at 3:45 AM,1, 51,
2022-05-28 20:09:56.605183,Kermitdaninja,It's Final Space buy it already!,"They have done an amazing job transporting you into the world of Final Space. It looks great and runs really smoothly, it's full of funny dialog from the characters, it's  blast everything that comes at you fun. The multiplayer element elavates this game to the next level of fun, I can't wait to play it with my son! My only request would be to add a run button. I really hope this game is successful enough to fund Final Space season 4!",Jan 15 at 7:45 AM,5, 10,
2022-05-28 20:09:56.621140,Helike,It's a game from fans to fans,"First of all, this game is based on the TV show 'Final Space' and is a huge tribute to the fans and made thinking of the fans, so that's it's the huge factor when analyzing it and, if you are not a fan, you likely will not enjoy it.

That aside, I really enjoyed the visual, playability and polish of the game, the details are really well thought out and the expandability to the show's universe is very welcome. 
The storyline is okay, you can get going with it, but not to the point of being memorable and the wrap up was kinda meh, not disappointing, but meh.
The game AI could use some improvements, it starts a lil challenging as the enemies come all out with evades and dizzy paths but soon the narrow behavior tree shows it's defects and the movement of the enemies turns predictable forcing the game to result in mass enemy waves to impose some challenge. The bosses are kinda hit and miss(?), they, alone, are pretty easy and even dumb at times (a lot of times the boss would circulate me to then go far away to start attacking), but when they came with enemy waves they manage to get you alot of times, as you have to get distracted with the small enemys and they get you in the process.
The game unfortunately runs a bit short with low replayability (on solo mode but if you play with friends your mileage may vary, as the game difficult adapts to the amount of players), however it's acceptable, increase the play time could result in a boring story as the devs would have to add a bunch of unnecessary fillers. But would be nice to see more puzzles or side stories (maybe a survival, crew logs, creatures to save or even another villain that were controlling the main villain) to increase the play time, assuming they mess with the AI, would be cool to see a point defense mode or something for some replayability.

Finally, the game is a fun experience, worth the time, maybe not the money (on steam it might be better) and, for fans, it's a blast, dawg!",Feb 2 at 12:36 AM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:09:56.636101,CPTSmeckles,honesty a really bad game,"theres some playability to this from a final space fan BUT in actual fact, the game absoluetly sucks more than hitman vr, the enemies run at you but you cant run away? the lack of weapons is way off and the dialogue is just all around dissapointing, would avoid play this even if it became free.",Jan 26 at 1:41 AM,1, 3,

2022-05-28 20:09:59.751384,KellanCordova,Short game.,"there is only 3 chapters, and not enough content to justify its price. Its worth no more than $5 to me. Also the hardest difficulty in the game is not hard.",Jan 22 at 11:35 AM,1, 4,
