2022-05-28 19:08:23.000581,ryan.harney88,All Wrong,"Amazing concept, loved the idea but its all wrong.  Coming from a former paratrooper, the ability to do absolutly nothing inside the arcraft from hooking up the static line, checking eupiment, moving to the door, actually jumping, takes away from this whole experiance.  The whole experiance of being a paratrooper are the actions prefomed from the time the jump master gives the order to stand up untill the time you touch the ground.  I understand this to be basically a short video in VR but its off to a horrible start.  Graphics are garbage, short story is garbage, why are we blowing up inside the aircraft?  At least let us and the other paratroopers shuffle to the door.  Also it was Operation Neptune, not Overlord.

2022-05-28 19:08:23.015541,almychildren,"Bad, but has potential... I guess","They have a cool idea, but went about it in the wrong way. If this is a promo for their upcoming game, they did a horrible job. If you are looking for a cool airborne, jumping out of a plane experience, I do NOT suggest buying this. I get how sitting in the plane and getting ready to jump is part of the experience, but you'd think they'd put a bit more time into it. The animations are horrible and the scene with you jumping out is the worst... why would they structure it like that. I know a lot about the airborne operations in WW2 and I had no idea what was going on for a minute. FINALLY, you get to jump out of the plane... and then it ends...WTF!!!! they fade to black before you even hit the ground... why not let you hit the ground and THEN end the experience. What a disapointment!","Jul 29, 2020 at 3:10 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 19:08:23.031499,Rubber_Johnny,wow,"First of all, this is not a game. This is a simulation. The graphics are bad, the content is extremely low and the simulation ends when you think it´s just getting started. You sit on a plane filled with badly animated soldiers. Then you jump out of the plane to land on the battlefield. And that´s it. No, you don´t take part in the fight, you just jump out of the plane into a really ugly night. The end. This is supposed to be a promotion for their upcoming vr game and probably the worst promotion i´ve ever seen. This promotion is actually preventing me from buying their upcoming game. This simulation is not even worth one dollar and should be for free. Even then i would not spend one byte on my computer to save this and ""show it to my friends"". Because this is the worst vr experience i´ve ever had.

Thank you for nothing","Nov 17, 2017 at 5:01 PM",1, 35,
2022-05-28 19:08:23.046459,retrorecall,North worth it,"the graphics look really dated and wasn't the experience I thought it would be. It's also very short, thought there would be more of a build up or lengthier experience.","Aug 13, 2017 at 7:15 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 19:08:23.061419,curtisee111,Pretty good,"I see a lot of people are hating on the game, but I ""personally"" think it's pretty good. Maybe a bit short and too costy for what you're given, but worth a go!","Aug 10, 2017 at 3:30 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:08:26.205011,Azazel08,Now I am really excited for Among Heroes,"This very well polished 5 minute experience is short, simple and really sells the idea of the future full fledged experience coming out later this year. apparently sales of this experience are supporting the deveolpment of Among Heroes.","Jul 7, 2017 at 12:19 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:08:26.220968,Herobald,nice experience but.....,"nice experience but not worth it to pay for it.

2022-05-28 19:08:26.234930,ryanerandolph,Not worth your time,"Short, unpolished and looks like its form a video game from 7 years ago.  This should be free.","Jun 24, 2017 at 9:26 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:08:26.249890,Garlic_Thunder,Horrible Scam,First of all this is not a review. Its a video of a guy jumpimg out of a plane. That is it.,"May 7, 2017 at 11:31 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:08:26.263853,cybernettr,Could be so great,"Reminds me of (and maybe inspired by) ""Diggers: Trench Experience."" Very, very short (less than 5 minutes) so a little disappointing in that respect. Voices so faint you can hardly hear them in the airplane. But looking out the side of the airplane at all the paratroopers silhouetted against the night sky proved to be a strangely emotional experience for me. This could be so great if it were a little longer and with fewer flaws.","Dec 21, 2016 at 11:50 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 19:08:29.356581,Matthieu.1980,"bought it 0.99euro, its enough","Had some problem because i cannot use keyboard, (3 keys needed : exit, start, center rift) and had to plug xbox controller...
this is a really short (maybe less than 5 min) cutscene, with bad graphism (call of duty 1 was nicer) and no technical. VR will obviously never grow with this kind of app... sorry for devs, but this thing should really be a free app... thanks for trying anyway, i can't do better :-)","Dec 24, 2016 at 6:03 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:08:29.371542,MunozGirls,"Short, but not disappointed.","I failed to read the description, So I was confused as to why it was only 4 minutes long, It was indeed entertaining and I was going to rate it 3 stars, But since I read the description and noticed the sales are going to fund an actual game, Then I'm rating it 4 stars. Could've been a bit longer or different scenes to go through!","Nov 27, 2016 at 11:37 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:08:29.385504,FourT2,Very short but great,"This is just an interesting VR experience, but the purchase helps fund Among Heroes VR game, so I will gladly support it.","Dec 23, 2016 at 2:18 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 19:08:29.414426,LaRock0wns,Great but not for the price tag,"This experience is great, but not for the price tag.  It's about 5 mins long for $2.99 and that, I would wait for a sale at a cheaper price point.   With that said, I'm looking for more experiences from this studio as it has lots of potential","Nov 30, 2016 at 4:04 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:08:32.511144,intheuk,Great Experience,"I've still got the first one which is really good and a bit more poignant as it was being told by a veteran reliving his ordeal.  This time around the graphics have been updated and look much better.
It is a great way to get some idea of how it was for the paratroopers on D-Day and it does it with respect.

Wasn't too keen on the flames from the damaged engine on this one compared to the original experience which was more realistic and the animation on one of the planes being shot down was a bit out of place, minor quibbles aside I can really recommend it.
Looking forward to the completed  version next year.","Oct 31, 2016 at 4:01 PM",5, 4,
