2022-05-28 20:39:13.801632,ETerNia,the best vr game ever,"most of vr games on oculus store are intense and difficult to play. because they are targeted for hardcore gamers only. i am hardcore gamer, but i dont always want to play dfficult stressful game.
so i was looking for vr game that not complicate but fun.
and then i found this game. 
here is my review.
pros : 
1. super easy to play and very nice tutorial to get in to the game.
2. very nice stylized graphics and its not hurting my eyes at all!!
3. the freedom of 6DoF VR. (this game tells you what is VR, as you can see on the name, literally you can throw anything. )
4. replayable difficulties(Easy Normal Hard), after i was playing normal, i went hard directly and then i saw game over... i will try it again! 
5. just good range of price.

Cons
1. BGM is too boring and not intense enough
2. need more special items like Lucille bat(i loved it!)

but i think developers can solve this two cons with updates.
i also recommend this game for family users. my younger brother really like it too
so, my in conclusion, grab this game!","Feb 15, 2020 at 2:47 PM",5, 13,
