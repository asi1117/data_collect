2022-05-28 19:42:37.689530,jroc777,It's cheap. It runs. You do things.,"You have two modes: day and night.  You can't change venues.  You can't customize your character or horses.  You can't change the number of laps.  You don't even get a prize for winning.  No multiplayer.  No difficulty settings.  No Touch support.  You go forward, then turn left.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Sometimes you crash.  If you eat the glowing grass, you get faster and your horses crap out glowing green plusses.  It's fun for all of five minutes, but I challenge you to find a better Roman chariot racing game in VR.  Go ahead.  Try.","Feb 11, 2021 at 10:58 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:42:37.704490,I-M_BlackShaddow,Nice afternoon at the races?,"WHO KNOWS ???

(Well from developers comments, He DONT!!!)

For me ... this gives me sound, but sticks at the title screen whilst setting up, then Freezes the view to front, in a black window, which usually moves with the headset.

On return to Rift app, have to manually stop app, almost invariably followed with a BSOD.  If no BSOD, controllers and sensors won't respond untill I reboot PC!

O K !   
By my count 3 Reviews???

Still cant get past the start screen,  Still win't start or run,

ALWAYS Crashes on exit.

I really want to race a chariot !!!!

Please Help.","Nov 23, 2018 at 10:32 PM",1, 2,"You can use controllers to select Day or Night race, looking at or point at them and press A button. No more complicated it is. I don't know why you need reboot."

Old Review: Classical historian here. This is a actually a really good game, when it works. There are myriad bugs, but the sense of riding a chariot in the Hippodrome is there. The problem is, the game often bugs out at the loading screen. If you fixed it so that it would load reliably, I'd give it 4 stars, even with all the other bugs (flying chariots; getting hung up on other chariots, etc.). I also think the gamepad and keyboard are the way to go with this one. Touch support seems like it might be iffy with so many other issues. Congratulations on what promises to be a great game if it is supported!","Sep 24, 2017 at 8:36 AM",5, 4,
