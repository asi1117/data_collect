2022-05-28 17:21:21.362621,Ayman.Bakr,Amazing,I was really surprised by the high quality of the paintings. The sizes are realistic. It's an amazing experience.,Jan 29 at 1:16 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:21:21.377581,Squid3958,"Excellent design, sloppy implementation","This is a fantastic piece of work! The design of the hall is amazing, the quality of the rendering is superb, the paintings are extremely well represented, and the narration and information provided for each painting is tremendous.
The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the programmers employed to bring this to VR failed.
Movement is cumbersome and difficult. If you are moving right, you will constantly be correcting by physically turning to the left. If you are thethered, you wind up wrapping your headset cord around you in circles.
Jumping with the trigger is very imprecise, and you will constantly need to correct back and forth, nearer or closer in order to get in viewing position.
This would be relieved somewhat by just being able to toggle your view left or right without having to physically turn your real time body.
Having said all that, I am very grateful that the Kremers graciously produced this amazing opportunity to look at the work of some of the Masters.
To do so without charging people a fee for the benefit is an amazing example of philanthropy.","May 6, 2021 at 11:26 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 17:21:21.392541,Eona_,Magnificent!,"I walked barefoot and in my pyjamas over the floor made of marble, having the whole gallery just for me... awesome feeling! The textures are high quality, the spoken descriptions are high quality, the whole room is such a cool room for a museum!","Mar 8, 2021 at 4:16 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:21:21.408498,Jzeero,Great little museum gallery,"I'm honestly surprised at how high the quality of the paintings are. You can get as close to them as possible and see amazing details. They even added a reflective effect on the canvas of the painings. I wish it was a little bit easier to move around though, I feel like you can only look in one direction which kills the immersion a little bit.","Feb 23, 2021 at 10:30 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:21:21.422460,cav800,Absolutely the best VR art museum!,The Kremer Collection is exactly what I have been looking for in a VR art museum. Teleportation is fluid and easily gets you anywhere you want to stand.  There are several paintings in this museum and each one has an audio file that provides a brief yet informative description. The paintings themselves are also extremely well rendered in high definition and look incredibly real up close. I am very impressed with this experience.,"Mar 6, 2021 at 11:07 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:21:24.547103,cestomano,High quality pictures,"Very good quality, the pictures are faithfully digitized at high resolution. Pleasant walk in this virtual museum. Hopefully someone will make more galleries of this kind.
Maybe the ""museum ticket"" is a little expensive. Luckily I got it for free (for Oculus).","May 28, 2020 at 6:03 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:21:24.562063,EddieNanakase,Fantastic painting gallery !,"The detail on these paintings is really high !  That gloss gives it a nice touch of realism to these paintings.  One thing that I think no one mentioned is the amount of detail from some of the smaller portraits, especially the copper ones.  These little portraits have an incredible amount of detail that can't be seen with two eyes.  Just go up close to one of these little frames and close one of your eyes and you will soon discover all of this incredible detail !  To the point that it makes me feel like I have the actual piece of art work in my hands !  The only thing I had problems with, was positioning.  You are positioned most of the time at a certain angle, I guess this is done so that you are able to look at the paintings without having the gloss interrupting your view.  So when you start, I would suggest to move around counter clockwise to avoid the gloss reflection.  A very nice touch was the audible tourist guide info that you can play for each painting to get to know a little bit of the artist and what was he or she painting.  This is definitely one of my favorite art galleries !","Apr 18, 2020 at 3:21 PM",5, 3,Thank you for such a great review Eddie!
2022-05-28 17:21:24.578021,ourlordleviathan,Won't install,"It tells me my antivirus is blocking the install even with it turned off.

EDIT: Got it installed now. I must say that other than the pretentious intro, it is a nice program. I was surprised just how small some of the pieces realy were.","Apr 29, 2020 at 7:40 AM",4, 8,"UPDATE: our engineers are looking into this

Dear ourlordleviathan, could you email us on info@moyosa.nl so we can help figure out what is going on? This is a new issue for us and we'd like to help you, so you can enjoy the experience. Kind regards, Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:24.591983,HarbingerThrace,AWESOME,"It feels like you are actually looking at a real painting.  The paintings even have that glossy reflective surface.  They are rendered in such high quality.  And the curators' descriptions of the paintings are interesting.  Great collection.  Only minor gripe is that the controls are a bit wonky in some minor parts, but not a huge deal.  Hope more exhibits like this are made in VR!","May 30, 2020 at 9:29 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:21:24.606943,PimpTears,Doing my part,"This is the kind of thing I imagined when I had VR in mind. We definetely need more gems like this in the Oculus store. I would give this 10 stars if I could. Although I bought this during the sale, after experiencing that glorious adventure I would happily buy it at twice the full price. Sometimes, it only takes you resonating with a single piece of art to make a significant price tag worth it, and this has MANY of those. The only way to make this better would probably be having the ability to hand some of these pieces at your Oculus home to look at each time before you head off into your next VR adventure. Is that perhaps the gift store expansion?","Nov 30, 2019 at 10:16 AM",5, 8,"Thanks for a great review!! We actually have the Oculus home functionality ready to go and have asked Oculus to get this through, but we re still waiting...Stay tuned!"
2022-05-28 17:21:27.692690,TonyByte,Nice Effect,"I have no interest in paintings but was fascinated by reviews of high quality and thought I may be interested in paintings if I gave it a try. I will say that it is a cool effect and I won't give a low rating. However, by people talking about being so up close for inspection and high resolution, I assumed it was 3D scans of the actual paintings where I would be observing the actual / modeled brush strokes, cracks, etc. That sounds amazing. The details are there but they are there in the same way of a print copy. Not ""real"" or actually virtual models. It's flat virtual posters with a digital, glossy, embossed, texture effect placed over them. Good  resolution and I recommend this with that in mind. However, it's not what I expected and what I expected probably isn't even allowed? Still nice.  Apparently better navigation is on the way.","Aug 21, 2019 at 8:41 AM",4, 4,"Dear Tony, thank you for your honest feedback; always valuable! We re continuously trying to improve the experience based on user feedback and hardware updates, which are currently limiting us in terms of resolution. The imaging when viewed for instance on a retina screen is crystal clear; but we need to wait for Varjo, Mark Z and the other to bring that inside HMD's. We've updated our navigation significantly and will continue to bring new features to the experience, so stay tuned! Cheers, Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:27.708647,Onix11,,Worth every penny,"Oct 13, 2019 at 7:34 PM",5, 3,Thanks Onix!
2022-05-28 17:21:27.723607,spandrel53,Excellent,The image quality is the best I've seen of any virtual art.  Great way to not sacrifice performance by waiting until you are close to a painting to render its fine detail. Thank you!,"Aug 18, 2019 at 11:32 AM",5, 2,Thanks Spandrel! Great to hear you're enjoying the museum!
2022-05-28 17:21:27.738567,Bean281,incredible experience!,"Jus saw this at a friends' house and have ordered my own Rift now as well....By far the best art VR experience and this is coming from a non art lover. Amazing architecture, great quality of the paintings (which will prbably only get better as HMD's improve) and fun to explore and interact with. Very original way of presenting paintings and all in all, just a great fun experience for an amazing price!","Aug 22, 2019 at 3:37 AM",5, 2,Thanks Bean281!!
2022-05-28 17:21:27.753527,XtremeHardcoreGamer,It was better than what I expected.,"It is a well polished product of high quality. The gallery is nice, and the resolution and clarity of the pieces on point. The included information with voice over was a nice inclusion. Dutch masters isn't exactly my favorite (although I am open to learning more about them)- so I hope there is additional content in the future. There was a ""coming soon"" on one wall so I have hope. 

I hope all the big art museums/galleries are virtualized in the future. Imo, the sooner the better.

One con is that you had to physically turn. I don't know how hard it would be to implement a snap turn feature, but it would help the navigation of the virtual world immensely. Also a seated mode along with that would be nice. Sorry, I am lazy. Also the glare of the varnish sometimes didn't match between eyes which created an odd visual effect. Only at certain angles. 

Otherwise- I am satisfied with purchase and would recommend to any art enthusiasts.","Apr 20, 2019 at 9:00 PM",5, 1,"Hi XtremeHardcoreGamer! Thanks for this nice review! We are finalizing our rotation controls and will release this feature in the next few weeks. There is more content coming in the next months as well! Cheers, Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:30.836282,bcflynn2,This is what VR is for.,"This is easily the best VR app that I own, and I have had a Rift since it was released. The amount of detail here is outstanding- you get to witness paintings by Dutch masters up close and personal, each with thoughtful voice and text narration if desired. View the paintings like in a museum; walk up and see the detail, step back and see from a distance. Or just sit on your couch, put your headset on and enjoy the paintings leisurely, as they were meant to be experienced.

The paintings look absolutely real; the glare off the varnish and brushstroke textures makes each look as if you were viewing the actual artwork. Definitely buy this!","Jan 23, 2019 at 3:27 PM",5, 3,Thanks bcflynn2!!
2022-05-28 17:21:30.852239,PoolfanVr,Your own personal art gallery,"I'm not particularly an art connoisseur, in fact the paintings in the gallery were not familier to me but nevertheless I felt compelled to buy this because I am hugely interested in the potential of VR to bring experiences like this to the masses.  We can all visit art galleries but of course the finest art work is spread all over the world so there is massive potential with VR art galleries.

I was not disappointed, the critical thing for me is the quality of the reproductions - they are excellent, to the point that you really can appreciate the subleties of the art on display.  There is no need to feel sub-conscious about putting your nose right up to the paintings - it's like having an art gallery to yourself.

I would love it if more art made it's way into VR.  A gallery full of the finest paintings from all around the world in this quality would be amazing. An impossible art gallery right there in your VR world.

My only gripe with this application is that movement can be frustrating due to the lack of being able to rotate but I shall enjoy learning about these Dutch paintings all the same and look forward to more apps like this.","Dec 26, 2018 at 8:24 AM",4, 4,"Thank you PoolfanVr! We are working on the rotation suggestion for our roadmap! Kind regards, Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:30.867199,sumotoy,Very nice but buggy,"I got this problems:
1) Tracking problems, the pictures shaking when I move head by looking frontface, if I try to get close the pictures moving back (why???) a bit and the start shaking. I`m using 2 or 3 sensors and nothing change and this is the only vr app act like that, very annoying.
2) Why pictures are so distant from wall? And if you like so, why you don`t limit the gallery visit to prevent go under paintings.
3) There`s a way to stop music and get only ambient sounds? (like footsteps and small noises)
The quality is very high and fir fist time I got the feeling of a real gallery byt tracking problems are too bad and cannot enjoy.","Dec 26, 2018 at 11:29 PM",2, 1,"Dear sumotoy, thank you for your review. The app is working for other Rift users, including here in the office, so I wonder what could be the issue. We are happy to help you figure this out. Please contact me @joelkremer. With regards to point 2: this is a design choice and we like it because it's possible in VR and not in the physical world, which is what the architect was trying to show. Please get in touch and we will help you sort out the tracking issues! Cheers, Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:30.883156,Dancing-Sniper,I wish ...,"Colors are off - looks like cheap saturated magazine print.
I wish sound was stereo or at least to both ears.
Info text character size is too small if you are 10 feet away from the painting.","Dec 8, 2018 at 5:41 AM",4, 1,"Dear UKI-SNIPER, sorry you feel this way. We have done everything to make the experience as realistic as possible within the boundaries of today's hardware. That being said, we have had the experience checked by some well known old master experts, and they told us the colors were extremely close to the actual physical paintings...I wonder what you are seeing: perhaps it's a hardware settings matter? I am open to discuss privately if you'd llike. Please contact me via @joelkremer Cheers!"
2022-05-28 17:21:30.898117,saami81,Like a real art museum,"This experience is worth every penny. Graphics are very good and you could see even the tiniest details.

 Also big difference between looking art on flatscreen or VR is that in VR you could see real scale of painting.","Sep 8, 2018 at 7:14 PM",5, 3,"Dear Saami,

Thank you so much and we're happy you enjoyed the experience so much. We'll be adding more artworks and content in the coming months, so please keep following us! Best regards, Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:34.004807,RuneSR2,A must-have for the Oculus Rift!!!,"This app probably has the best graphics on the Rift, the paintings are simply out-of-this-world astonishing. Even if you don't care for - or know much about - art, try this app (in the presumably rare case that you don't like it, you can always get a refund). I'm forcing super-sampling 2.0 using Oculus Tray Tool, and not even Lone Echo provides textures like the images shown here. It didn't feel like Virtual Reality - it felt like reality. The graphics are so life-like that I'm not sure seeing the real paintings would provide a significantly better experience than using the this app. In short - I'm totally blown away by the quality of these paintings, it really felt like I was using a headset much better than even the Vive Pro - and I'm not trying to be funny. 
Furthermore you get stories told to each painting, so these aren't just paintings, but experiences that come to life. This virtual museum is so much better than most of the art museums I've visited in the real world, and that says a lot. 
The only annoying thing was teleport movement - I'd suggest that the developers soon support full locomotion as an option; I'm convinced that most visitors would like to walk around, and not to jump around, in such an amazing museum ;-) Congrats to the developers - you truly deserve it, even the wooden and marble floor textures are incredibly awesome - and my Touch controllers are made of GOLD, who can top that?! :-)
(Note: Some Steam users complained about having to log in or having to create an account to use this app, this have been completely removed in the Oculus version, thus Oculus users have instant access to everything)","Sep 5, 2018 at 5:52 AM",5, 5,"Dear RuneSR2, wow: now THAT is a great review and is going around the office like a fire! Thank you so much and we're so happy you are enjoying the experience so much. We're especially proud of your review about the quality of the resolution as this was our number 1 priority when developing the museum. Nothing will replace a physical viewing experience, but our aim was to develop as close to that as possible, and then to be able to share that with a lot more people than physically possible, as well as start testing the possibilities of richer content storytelling. We have also taken note of your ""locomotion"" suggestion and will discuss that in our next review meeting. Thank you again! Joel Kremer"
2022-05-28 17:21:34.020764,alejandro.marcu,Awesome quality!,"I'm very impressed with the quality of the app. The resolution of the art is very high (I didn't even think Rift had so good resolution), and also you can see the texture of the paintings and the light reflecting, which makes it very realistic and immersive.

A couple of things that I think would be good additions to the app:
- Be able to rotate, so that you don't need 360 tracking and can move more comfortably.
- An index of the art so you can easily find pieces","Aug 28, 2018 at 9:42 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for the great compliment Alejandro! And thank you also for the great suggestions! You'll be happy to hear that we are almost finished with an interactive floorplan, making it much easier to find and navigate through the museum. We have also put your rotation suggestion on the roadmap, as we feel this will bring a great benefit to users such as yourself, but also users unable to actually, easily move around in 360 (users in transit, in wheelchairs or hospitals, and many more). Stay tuned...Cheers, Joel Kremer"
