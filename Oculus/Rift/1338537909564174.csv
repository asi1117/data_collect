2022-05-28 18:34:21.675395,Kenjolio,Great except for Roomscale,"Playing on a quest 2 streaming via pcvr. Even when I play in my garage with more than 2.5 x 2.5 metres, it still won’t go to true roomscale so I end up using teleport or motion controls. Every room opens at a funny angle too so I have to orient by spinning the room. Immersion breaking. I emailed the developers but they didn’t reply.  I’ve played a couple hours now and it’s pretty fun! I intend to keep it, but buyer beware.","Mar 6, 2021 at 10:12 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:34:21.691353,Driscol,Very creepy,One of the better horror VR experiences I've had and not the cheap jump scares type even though there are those. It is very clever and has deep meaning and the story is good.,"Feb 9, 2021 at 7:22 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 18:34:21.706313,resurect4,VERY BUGGY,"I looked at the reviews and thought give it a go, the graphics are not very good and it is very hard to grip with both hands when playing for more than 30 minutes. Its just ok nothing special Wilsons Heart is much better and no bugs.","May 23, 2020 at 10:00 PM",3, 28,
2022-05-28 18:34:21.720276,Huurk,I want a sequel!,"I loved the storyline and the immersiveness of the game.  I don't know how many times I jumped and shouted profanities, but it was quite a few!  One of the best horror games I've played.","May 4, 2020 at 8:41 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:34:21.735236,neuoc,A more than amazing story,"*SPOILER ALERT*        This game is honestly a peice of Art to start the graphics in this game are so insanely realistic I forgot where i was at times, when i was holding a bible in the game I could see dust and scratches like it had actually ben used before. Not to mention this goes for everything the chairs walls cups etc.
but aside from the stunning graphics the story is even better, now it starts off pretty confusing your in a hospital people giving you pills doing memory tests on you. But the more you play the more intense and deep the story goes, it suddenly goes from confusing to scary and intense, the jumpscares give you a quick thrill but figuring out who you are and what you did gave me a whaaaat moment and the chills. There are a ton of plot twist that genuinely had me screaming, now if you put all of these things together the outstanding graphics intense story and a big amount of gameplay time you get a actuall AAA game","Nov 29, 2019 at 4:46 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 18:34:24.850902,lattejake,Frustrating controlls,"So, the story seems to be interesting, but the controls make playing the game so frustrating that I don't think I will finish it. 
Hard pass on this one unless/until it gets updated.","Dec 9, 2019 at 10:51 AM",2, 17,
2022-05-28 18:34:24.865862,reesestrom,Initially bad but gets better.,"So I just got the game and as I started playing I was initially frustrated at the very awkard angle that the hands were at in the game when compared to yours in real life, and I am frustrated with the controls which are more optimized for the HTC vive with the trigger being used as the grip button. If there's a way to change the controls that I missed that would be amazing. Overall really scary though.","Jun 27, 2019 at 11:10 AM",3, 26,
2022-05-28 18:34:24.881820,NotaHumanResource,A Gem of a game,"If you like to be drawn into a story and like a few awsome scares then this is your game.  You are a patient under treatment trying to regain your memory. You are not stuck in the room and traverse an unraveling  story through your memories. The graphics are amazing except for a few items occasionaly that are not rendered in 3d. I seriously jumped a few times playing this game and punched at the air. I will probably play this through one more time.  I did have to look up how to get out of one of the rooms online but there is a full cheat list for this game on Steam.
**DEVS** This is a great game please don't let it die. Update the few poorly rendered items, and continue to work on any minor bugs and add features such as a setting to crank up horror element to add more jump scares etc. please Give the character full arms. When that little kid started crawling down the hall I wanted to run out of my house. Excellent!","May 19, 2019 at 12:53 AM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 18:34:24.897777,RuneSR2,Still an awesome experience!,"The graphics, although some (wooden) textures could still be better, are really second to none. I would've preferred arms, not just hands in-game, but you've got nice Touch support and the most awesome hands. When the lighting is right, you can even see the ultra-tiny hairs covering your skin, really amazing! 
Texture quality is very high, often Lone Echo quality. Holding a postcard felt real - even the surface of the postcard had been designed with special reflections so it looked genuinely old and worn - simply amazing. The attention to details is great - even wall-mounted clocks are working in realtime.
I believe you can crank up super sampling to about 1.5 on a GTX 970 and still get solid 90 fps - and using a GTX 1080 or better you get solid 90 fps using super sampling 2.0. Holding a tiny model of the Eiffel Tower in my hand, and checking it thoroughly, the Rift CV1 resolution felt close to infinite - no I'm not joking. There're no in-game video settings, thus super sampling (using for example the Oculus Tray Tool) is more or less your only option to improve graphics. 
I don't think this is a horror game, like Transference there're spooky moments but it's more about suspense than horror - maybe we could just call the game for a thriller...? ;)
I did see one guy criticizing the game on Steam: ""I found the puzzles to either be dead-simple or very unintuitive. A lot of them also involved an object randomly showing up when it wasn't there before, which is lame."" I don't think that critique is warranted, obviously that person didn't understand the game dynamics. You're a psychiatric patient, you're hallucinating, you're given medication - of course things suddenly change - that's exactly what hallucinations are about!
I've played the game for about 2 hours, in some places you can feel that the design is slightly dated and levels of onscreen polys could be better, but this is an adventure game, and this one still stands as tall among it's nearest competitors as ever!","Dec 4, 2018 at 3:52 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 18:34:24.912737,Achtung_Wolfgang,This was Fun !!,"The music, the atmosphere, and the story all worked together wonderfully.  Just the right amount of horrific surprises I'd say.   Everything moves right along without getting stuck where you  have to do the same things over and over again.  Attn adults and adult wannabees:  I'm 66 and I loved this game !","Nov 15, 2018 at 10:50 PM",5, 31,
2022-05-28 18:34:27.987513,darkesco,Giving 5 starts for graphics,"Honestly, I can't play too much of this at once. So far, great graphics and errie!!! I might change my review as I play more, but I doubt it. It has succeeded in filling me with dread, it looks stunning, has great audio, and controls don't make me want to kill myself (paranormal activity). VR is just so much more scary than regular games, but so far this is a great game!","Nov 7, 2018 at 10:57 AM",5, 16,
