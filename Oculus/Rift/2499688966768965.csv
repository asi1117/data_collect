2022-05-28 18:50:50.362013,8_Buddah_8,Lots of potential..,"I know it's probably hard to create realistic friction with an imaginary stick and puck but if it could be refined just a tad more to make dangles more realistic I could see this becoming a real big thing. Maybe even sell to EA down the line.

Edit after Dev response: Still needs a lot of work. Puck control is more responsive but still can't justify bothering to play. Probably not at your fault but at the current development of VR. Multiplayer is just a completely frustrating experience as the puck won't even respond to touches the same way it does in single player making a fun competitive experience feel just stupid.

Edit 2: Six months later, I don't know what updates were made but I can't tell a difference, I feel like a ghost, puck comes to me I move it in front of me, it's behind me, defender cuts in front of me, I poke the puck he glides right past me and scores. It's bad. I like the attempt and I like how you're pushing for the future of VR but I don't get why it's THAT bad. Blue team was making tape to tape passes and I can't even touch the puck without it glitching.

Edit 3: Didn't watch the tutorial because the issue is the puck not responding to stick touch, I don't know what a video would help with that? Also it's more like table hockey than actual hockey, most players only use one hand to push the puck around...that's not hockey that's something else. Sorry man we're at minimum 20-30 years behind technology to where this could be amazing. Thanks though for the effort it seems some people do enjoy this.",Mar 16 at 1:45 PM,4, 2,"The video shows how to play defense (take the puck) effectively despite the inherent network latency. I appreciate you not bombing the review, I've indeed sunk over 2 years of effort into making this as good as it can be and continue to tune!"

2022-05-28 18:50:56.762893,Gouyou,Game is not optimized,"Me and friend hop into the game, and it was really hard to enjoy. I tried using sidequest with quest2, but app would not get full screen, it was windowed. so I had to go with the cable and the thing was reaalllllllly laggy (we try quitting the game / rejoining a couples of times), coulnt get it working. My specs are not REALLY good, Im still stuck with a GTX970ti, but I mean I run every other games (no man sky, arktika, onward, pingpong etc). I was expecting that little hockey game to be really less hungry on resources ? (I don't even think my computer was really rushing to be honest. Simply buggy).

My friend on the RIFT had nausea after 5 minutes (he usually has no motion sickness when we play together).

So yeah, not quite as expected.","Feb 14, 2021 at 11:59 PM",1, 0,I'd love if you could join our discord and I can help you troubleshoot. The game was tested even on a gtx 1050 and ran smoothly for us. https://electricfalcon.net/discord

Works on the Quest 2 with a link cable, but if you try to play it wirelessly with Virtual Desktop it only shows up on your desktop screen and you can't do anything.

2022-05-28 18:51:03.040103,nb28,Potential to be a killer VR sports game,"At its core, this is the most fun I have ever had in VR. The controls are intuitive, if more like mini-sticks than actual ice hockey. That's okay though, because playing mini-sticks in the basement as a kid was one of my favorite pastimes. 

You'll get used to the game and become good at it quickly if you ignore the two hand mode, learn how to sprint (double-tap right trigger), and communicate with your teammates (let them know when pressure is on them, or when/where you're open). 

For a 3D client-server game, the puck physics are surprisingly good. There can be some frustrating moments where the puck seems to stick to an opponent's stick and you can't poke it away no matter what, but I think that's just a limitation of what's possible with netcode at this point.

There's a great community on Discord, and it seems like a small community league is starting to come together.","Mar 30, 2020 at 12:42 PM",5, 5,Thank you for your support! Glad you like the game :)

2022-05-28 18:51:06.227578,Eclipse8301,A great start to a great Hockey sim,"This is the begininng stages of what could be a very good Hockey sim, the dev seems very active and listens to everyones concerns. I am very hopeful that someday this will be a great Hockey sim, I will keep a close eye on this one during development.

Oh and its FREE! can't go wrong with that.","Mar 9, 2019 at 7:24 AM",4, 4,Thank you! I certainly hope to keep improving it!

2022-05-28 18:51:09.369176,Mickelous,VRs next big thing,"Take about 3 minutes to learn and people are very helpful in the games with any questions.  900 downloads on the GO alone in the first day (I have rift don't know how many rifters) but I'm tellin ya this is what hockey should be like in VR.  DEV is nowhere near done and listens to ideas.  He made it free because he got injured playing hocky irl and wanted people to play with so he made this game so he could share his love of hockey with the world.  NHL would be stupid to not get him some dev help and license the thing.  

Don't be surprised if this is VR's next big thing I have more fun with this than echo arena.   The fights on the boards for the puck are hectic and its so fun to land the perfect pass to the guy in front of the net.   Buy this game ASAP.  Wait its free so there's NO EXCUSE not to download it right now.  In fact why are you reading this and not playing?","Feb 21, 2019 at 9:50 AM",5, 10,I certainly hope it becomes a big thing! Thanks!
2022-05-28 18:51:09.385133,V3Y3R,Awesome game!,"To be short, if you own a Oculus you should get this!

Easily the best free Oculus sports game besides Echo Arena. I didnt expect much when downloading it, but I was shocked. While the graphics and gameplay are simple and it is no big budget game, it is a really fun and simple hockey game! I happened to get in a game with the Dev and got to talk to him which was really cool. Great job for a single dev game and the fact he made it free is just well, amazing! I would happily pay for a game like this as like Echo Arena, you can play over and over and still enjoy it. So great job and thanks for making this free for everyone! I can't wait to see what is added to this game in the future as I think adding things like a more polished engine, better physics, better graphics, and just overall giving this game a good polish could easily make it be up there with games like Beat Saber and Echo Arena! Hope this game will continue to be improved and I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds for this one!","Feb 22, 2019 at 1:23 AM",5, 8,Glad you enjoyed it! Thanks for the great feedback!
2022-05-28 18:51:09.401090,wraithwon,Really cool hockey sim!,"The game has simple graphics, but once you're into the game and flying around the ice against other players you really get immersed. Taking a slapshot, flipping a behind the back pass to set up your teammates shot is a great feeling. Its a lot of fun to just skate around body checking the opposing players too!","Feb 21, 2019 at 1:21 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 18:51:12.513765,Coolnige,Awesome!,"Ever since you've played NHL on console, you've always thought to yourself, ""I just wish there was a way to have full control of the player.. ""  

Well, now there's a way.  

Use your own two hands to control a stick and dangle your way down the ice, shoot nasty clap bombs, and snipe filthy wristers.  This game is great.  I found myself spinning in circles and got tangled up in my rift cords for a minute.  Didn't matter.  Love this game.  

If you like hockey, whatsoever and in any fashion, try this game.","Feb 22, 2019 at 6:26 AM",5, 4,Thanks for the great review!

I'd love for you to join our discord group (check www.electricfalcon.net/pickuphockey) so we can discuss it further. Currently it only allows skating forwards and backwards because thats normally how skating works! I will probably be adding a form of joystick locomotion with limited strafing in the future but the goal is to be as close to real hockey as is reasonably possible. Many of the skilled players are actually arguing against adding sideways movement, since you can free-coast and look in any direction you want anyway."
