I physically turn around (doing a 180), and since I have limited coverage with my Oculus sensors in that direction, it's glitchy. I try to restart, try to exit, and all the menu controls have been disabled by the app. 

NOT nice. So I think. hey, maybe it's me. I Alt-F4 the app. Shut down every other app on my system and then start it back up. Again. There's the wall. Again. There's literally no way in app to turn around and no way to exit. 

So I ALT-F4 again. 

To the DEV - While I know this is in DEV, My advice is to NAIL OUT the absolute basics of your app before putting it on the app store.  Movement/Rotation and shutting down should be obvious candidates for ANYONE like me who insists on good first impressions for ANY app, paid or not. Nothing will have me asking for a refund faster than a very poor simple initial experience. 

Fortunately, I didnt have to with this.","Jun 21, 2021 at 3:59 PM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 19:51:00.972045,Oculis_Gamer,A Great Start,A very captivating short story. The developers show potential and I hope the continue to work on this and expand on the story. I think the concept of a pop-up can do wonders in virtual reality!!,"Jul 23, 2019 at 9:30 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:51:00.986008,whitneyharrism,Cute but confusing,"I love this little interactive storybook! However, the story goes a little fast and I wonder if there is only one ending to the story. I think adding different endings based on what the player does would make this a lot more in depth for the player. All in all, it is a very cute short story that has a unique element not seen in VR often.","Oct 31, 2018 at 2:13 AM",4, 4,

Everything happened way too fast, i could barely follow the story. Also, i often did not know what to do next. Interacting with the book felt very random. Finally, the ending was so abrupt, i first thought the game crashed. So: everything is there yet, it just needs to be reworked, i think.","Sep 15, 2018 at 4:40 AM",3, 9,
