2022-05-28 18:25:25.181299,Tybern,A genuine delight,"Charm Games manages to create VR environments that look incredible, and appear to have mastered the ability to create an interactive experience which doesn't leave you queasy. The back-of-hand aiming took a bit to get used to, but by the end of the game felt perfectly natural. Eager to see what they create next.","Jan 1, 2021 at 12:57 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:25:25.196259,Dakina,Must have for puzzle fans,"This game is fantastic. The graphics are beautiful. The music goes well with the game. And the puzzles are fun and make good use of the VR effects. It is also nice to have a look around you, because the surroundings are also very beautiful to see. I really enjoyed Twiligth Path. The only downside is the short duration of the game. Hopefully more games like this will be released.","Sep 6, 2020 at 1:19 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:25:25.211219,Roche5000,Breath taking,"The scenery is amazing, in every area I paused just to enjoy where I was. The game isn't hard beat in about an hour or so, but was completely worth the money. The work that they put into this, I will be checking out their other projects.","Jul 30, 2020 at 6:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:25:25.226179,Zennius,A true journey into an enchanted realm,"A masterful world exists within this stunning game.  Filled with cleverly designed puzzles and a well done graphical array, this game exceeded what I would have expected from a smaller developer like Charm Games.  The storyline is solid, the puzzles a slight challenge, and the experience completely immersive.  The feeling of just ""playing a game"" melted away quickly as I began to explore the world that I was now in, creating the VR experience that many of us often look for.  

Game play is short on this one, easily completed within a few hour window. 
 As many have said, the game could have lasted far longer and been delightful the entire journey.  Nonetheless, if you enjoy puzzle games and want a true VR style experience, you'll likely find this title brings it to you.   If you catch the title on sale I'd consider it an absolute ""Must Buy!"", though it's worth the purchase even at full price.","Mar 24, 2020 at 9:28 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:25:25.241139,Cynner,,"I'm a Charm Games fan now.  I was hooked with Form, and I don't regret paying full price for this one, either.  I'll buy everything else they choose to make as well.  A really beautiful little game with fun puzzles and charming characters. If these devs built a long-playing game, I'd die happy.","Jan 24, 2019 at 5:33 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:25:28.357803,sCOREscream,Thanks Charm Games Devs !!!,"I've played Form and I've played Twilight Pass and the one thing I learned is: ""Charm Games"" know how to dsign a VR game. I really like your style of puzzle games for VR. Yes it is way to short, but wouldn't matter how long it would be, because its that awesome I would anyway say its not long enough :-)
If I see another Charm Game coming, be sure I will buy it, because it looks like you Devs can really guarantee for great games - thanks !!!","Dec 26, 2018 at 10:37 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:25:28.372763,DirkWinston,I really loved this game.,A beautiful game from Charm Games.  Wonderful environments and just the right level of difficulty regarding the puzzles. Very challenging but quite fun too. An excellent effort on the part of the developers. Looking forward to the sequel.,"Dec 25, 2018 at 8:34 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:25:28.388720,Dropla,Really fun little world to love!,"So, the graphics are decent, the setting was what really drove me to be in awe more than the quality of the graphics. They are cartoony, which is fine by me, but seemed a like if just a little more was put into some places they would have taken my breath away. There are characters you will encounter that are SO COOL! Ever watch Never ending story? You will see someone that will remind you of a scene in there! Also, a lot of other really fun characters to eperience I don't really want to say what they are, because I want you to experience them like i did *-* I didn't get nored, I played straight through, took maybe a couple hours? That seems pretty fair for the price, for SURE! You get to feel pretty cool and magical when you complete some of the puzzles lol, I kept thinking that as I was playing ""this is totally what it would feel like if I had this kind of power"" hahaha im such a dork! But, it is a little childish, but, it's kinda fun to feel like you are in magical story where thomas the train, never ending story had a baby and that baby made a baby with avatar the last airbender (anime not the monstrosity of a movie) Anyway, the puzzles aren't hard, there were a couple times they took a few minutes, but, not really more than that. If you get stuck on one, you're probably over thinking it lol I tend to do that.  So, with that said ~if all of my ramblings sound like a good time, have no fear in picking this one up and have fun!","Oct 8, 2018 at 3:34 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:25:28.402683,Hanover,"Immersive, but Short","Its a pretty cool game that really does make you a part of the story.  There are times when you are standing and riding along with the main characters that feels pretty cool.  Unfortunately it's over before it really begins, with hints that there will be sequels soon.  

If you played Form, then you'll immediately recognize the puzzles since they've pretty much re-constituted the puzzles from that game and put them into this one.  Maybe next time they could come up with something a bit more original. :)","Oct 29, 2018 at 2:31 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:25:28.417643,jr1465,Very Nice Game,"This is my first completed game in VR.  I started the game wondering if I was going to like it.  Yet, after playing through, I found it to be a nice game.  This game is a great game for people who are starting in VR and who love puzzles with great effects.  The only thing that really made me sad was the timing of the game.  I played on and off for less then a day and completed it.  I do rate this game for someone who is starting out in VR, but if you have played other games, you may find your skill level a little high and will finish this game in no time.  I will give my hat off to the design staff for the great graphics and story line.  Great Job, I do look forward to the next installment.","Oct 6, 2018 at 8:57 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:25:31.510371,mxmbulat,A decent puzzle game though...,"Since it is coming from the same developer standing behind The Form, I have been expecting the same quality and this is not the case. The world is beautiful - very nice colours, very good atmosphere, music is what I like. In comparison to The Form puzzles seem to be much easier. My biggest dislike are the controls - at a certain point when you are expected to rotate a handle, I could not grab it for the sake of god. Touch controller would buzz as if I was touching something but the handle would not rotate. The spheres with which you interact with the world are not there where you would expect them to be in relation to your controller position. The story is more pertinent to the puzzles than in The Form. In summary - it's a decent beautiful puzzle game though I would love to see an update that fixes clunky controls.","Oct 18, 2018 at 7:36 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:25:31.525331,Lotom,Beautiful,"Graphics are pretty, and the puzzles were interesting as far as I got. At one point a level bugged and there was nothing to do. There is no option to restart a puzzle, but restarting the app reloaded it. My only other request would be to improve the clunky controls. It is a very difficult game design lesson, and one I have leared the hard way, but easier controls are preferrable to realistic controls.","Oct 9, 2018 at 2:39 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:25:31.540291,Nol_Rinela,Short but sweet,"I enjoyed my time playing this puzzle game, the puzzle aren't overly complex but just enough to give a sense of satisfaction when completing them. Will this game change your life forever and raise the dead and do all sorts of wonderious things? No but it's just a fun puzzle game.","Oct 9, 2018 at 2:21 AM",5, 0,

My Thoughts:
A superb, magical adventure that ticks all the right boxes. Great story, impressive locations, cool graphics and effects, charming characters and unique and innovative puzzles.
This is  an adventure you really feel like you are involved with.
I was a really big fan of 'Form' (Charm Games 1st VR title) but I'm a much bigger fan of this one and especially its scope.
Well done guys!

PS. I have been hearing reports this is quite short, I hope not that would be a shame.","Oct 4, 2018 at 2:17 AM",4, 2,
