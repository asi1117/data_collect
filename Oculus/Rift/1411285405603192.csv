You can select drivers of different stats, numbers of laps, music, controls and I think difficulty level. I sort of settled on the pink girl driver because she's at least reliable at finishing and winning races. It isn't terribly exciting, but maybe that's why I like it? It reminds me of first playing Pole Position decades ago. It's a shame the devs seem to have wandered off as they promised more content in a response three years ago, so I'm going to have to shave a point off for that.  Also shaving off a point as there is just a certain limit to the number of laps you race as the pop up fuel tank icons are spotty. They can also run out, leaving you stranded. Frustrating as a ten lap race would be fun. 

TLDR Tame, yet family friendly racing game with throwback graphics.","Jan 29, 2020 at 4:54 AM",3, 3,

There are only three tracks and two background music tracks. There is no multiplayer. I feel like I could get out of the car and walk faster. It also looks like an asset flip. If you want a cart game, get VR Karts.","Aug 4, 2017 at 1:48 PM",1, 17,"Hi theregoes2, Our game has the quality and requirements to be here, as the description has the all information, there are six levels of velocity and difficult, try the hard one, also has a good quality and work well, related to VR Karts there is only three tracks and the multiplayer don't work well as you can see at game reviews, also We are working at new features and online mode that will realize when work well. Thank you."
