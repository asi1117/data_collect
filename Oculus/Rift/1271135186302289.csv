2022-05-28 15:22:18.498147,Brumpo_Barto,John Woo's Warframe VR,I never get sick of backflipping over dudes with dual pistols and that relic that slows time for every headshot. I'd like to request some kind of cosmetic where doves fly out from behind my character every time I land.,Sep 12 at 1:44 AM,5, 3,"Heya Brumpo_Barto! Thanks for the five stars! We appreciate it and it makes us really happy you are enjoying Sairento :)

Haha, well that would be a visually stunning cosmetic. Unfortunately, we won't be adding anything new to Sairento at the moment since our team is working on our next game, Hellsweeper VR! It is currently available on PC as a demo if you are interested :)!!

Thank you for your support!"
2022-05-28 15:22:18.513107,BigHawg,Would be 5 but lacking end game,Awesome game for sure. Potential is through the roof but the fact is it is lacking end game content. I had an amazing time playing this but now it is boring as I can kill enemies endlessly and its easy. There is no option to increase difficulty or spawn harder enemies. If they add this 5 stars all day.,"Mar 28, 2021 at 2:44 AM",4, 5,Thank you so much for giving us 4 stars! We will take note of this as we develop out next game! :)

The creators are pretty cool also, they're constantly adding new maps & they'll work with you to solve any issue you may have.   Love these guys & this game.","Jan 1, 2021 at 8:54 AM",5, 9,Thank you so much for giving us 5 stars and giving us your constant support! We really appreciate it! :)

2022-05-28 15:22:21.719531,fishy-is-salty,its too easy + bad controls and tracking,"ok this games works if you want to feel cool even though you didnt earn it and can deal the controls for some weapons, in particular the kunai, which are at best unpredictable and at worst downright awful. Also, if you are using the rift S, have fun trying to aim guns with the ever persistent jitters. Would be 5 stars if not for this, but it has made the game a headache to play for me. however, I must say the movement system is original and fun, and these issues dont affect the melee which may just be the best part of the game anyway.","Mar 29, 2020 at 10:58 PM",3, 2,"We recognize that the throwing weapons are not as consistent as the other weapons. Would you be able to take a video of your controller jitters and send it to support@mixedrealms.com so that we might narrow down on the issue and if possible, fix this as soon as we can!

2022-05-28 15:22:21.750448,deejm2112,Countless hours...,"One of the few games I have where I've spent countless hours. Some nights I just keep going.

I like the load out variation, swords or guns and the bullet time. I'd like to see an update as it can get tedious after a long while, play missions and continue, no boss or plot after a while. Can I change my armor to other options? It gives an appearance there are multiple armor options but I've never seen more than the default. There seems to be a lot of possibility.","Dec 5, 2019 at 8:42 AM",5, 3,"Thank you so much for the 5 stars and support! We are so glad you liked the cyber ninja experience!

2022-05-28 15:22:24.859134,fourisariot,Still my favorite,"I bought this game a while back when I first got my Rift.  As a casual gamer, revisiting this game occasionally is always a great experience.  As other reviewers have said, this is definitely an arcade-style game. All of the mechanics (movement, time slowing, weapons handling, etc.) work really well for the premise of the game.  I absolutely love using the bow as my main weapon.  Jumping, slowing time, and taking enemies out with an arrow to the head is so satisfying. There is a small learning curve to really master movement but once you do, the movement mechanics are the best I've seen in any VR game IMHO.  Customizable weapons loadouts and upgrades are great and provide some variety.  I have seen other reviewers mention a lack of enemy variety.  This is a non-issue for me as a casual gamer.  I just want to jump in and defeat whatever enemies come my way.","Nov 2, 2019 at 4:13 AM",5, 3,Thank you so much for the 5 stars and support! We are so glad you liked the short bursts of cyber ninja experience! Hope that you will continue to feel that way about our game for a long time! :)

2022-05-28 15:22:24.905011,jdawg57,Great fun but bad performance,"I really like this game and recently upgraded to an rtx 2070 with a ryzen 2700x. That said, I have gotten continous performance issues even on the lowest settings. The main problem occurs when there are alot of enemies. The screen flashes for a second and when I move my hands there is a ghosting/double vision effect. This should not be happening even on lower settings. Any feedback would be great.","Sep 7, 2019 at 8:37 AM",3, 7,"Thank you for informing us about this we have been trying to optimize the game even further, we will do our best to and we hope that you will be more patient with us while we get it done! :)"
2022-05-28 15:22:24.921966,taquitobuddy,"Great game, hope a sequel is even better","After completing this now, I wanted to write up my final review.  

Pros:
++Amazing loot system, along with a great character progression system.
+Excellent movement system with bullet-time mechanic, overall a great fit for VR
+Fantastic options menu where you can adjust everything to your liking (though what some features do could be more clear)

Neutral and Cons
+/- Decent amount and variety of content (I'd estimate about 20 hours worth), including several different modes.  Multiplayer is missing much of this content though - a much better single player experience.
+/- The super awesome amazing loot system, and character progression system in general, is hamstrung by an ""end game"" to actually use it on/with.  Depending on the player, somewhere between Prestige 1-2 (I reached level 200/Prestige 2 in about 20 hours) the game becomes trivial in terms of difficulty (even without using the permanent slowdown headpiece).  So you can make a really cool extraordinarily customized character loadout, and then there's nothing challenging to do with it.  No bosses with challenging mechanics, only very basic coop MP and semi-non-functional MP PvP.  I was dissapointed, but ONLY because the game had been so great up to that point.

Conclusion: Still recommend the game, was worth the price.  I hope they make a sequel that does the game's potential justice.","Aug 27, 2019 at 10:36 PM",4, 6,Thanks so much for giving us a 5 star rating! Really appreciate the support!
2022-05-28 15:22:28.013696,superpozition,Fun as hell.,"One thing Vr games miss is the challenge. This game is packed with challenging ways to win. It’s also just fun as hell. I’m pretty fed up with terrible VR experiences and 500 puzzle games released every month. This game is simple at its core. It’s very arcade like (far from AAA), but what it does, it does very well. The biggest issue is how friggin limited the levels are. There’s like 3-4 actual levels to fight in. I went through the entire game in 2 hrs and could not for the life of me convince myself to just keep replaying the same thing over and over. Add more content. People will move onto bigger things and get bored fairly quick with such an MVP model of a game.","Sep 6, 2019 at 9:43 AM",4, 1,Thank you so much for the 4 stars and support! We are so glad that you enjoyed the cyber ninja experience that our game has to offer! We have been adding more and more content from the Occulus Quest to the PC. A total of 10 extra maps will be in! :)
2022-05-28 15:22:28.028656,Skuggfax,A great game,"Really cool and fun game with tons of customization which is great. There are so many different weapons to play around with. The story was a bit short but you have all the different kinds of missions when you've played through the story mode. The only down side for me is that it gets a bit repetitive after a while. I find myself coming back to it every now and then for an hour or so at a time and it's a lot of fun, just wish there was a little more diverse gameplay for the end game. Again can't stress enough how awesome the customization options with so many different weapons are. Worth the money for sure, if you're into action and fighting this is the game for you. If you get motion sickness in VR this is NOT for you. A lot of jumping around, running on walls and doing back flips while shooting enemies upside down in the air even gets me a little dizzy despite having used VR for quite a long time.","Aug 7, 2019 at 4:34 AM",4, 2,Thank you so much for the detailed review! We tried to increase the replayability of the the game by having a wide range of relics for you to explore with as many of there are legendary relics which changes how the weapons work! :)
2022-05-28 15:22:28.043616,BlechBOX,Excellent Game,"I purchased this game over a year ago and I still think it is one of the most fun games I own. This game provides an experience only possible through VR which is why I bought a headset in the first place. I highly recommend anyone try it out and for anyone new to the game, don't stop moving.","Jul 12, 2019 at 10:01 AM",5, 11,Thanks so much for giving us a review even thought it's been a while since the game was purchase! :) Appreciate the 5 stars!
2022-05-28 15:22:28.059574,darkrogue05,The best game i hate,"I would like to rate this game with a five out of five.Its incredibly addicting, but i cant enjoy this game because every time i play it,it freezes!!!! No matter what changes I make, the end result is the same. It always freezes and its infuriating!","Aug 10, 2019 at 5:52 PM",1, 1,Hey there! This seems unusual indeed. Could you reach out to us over at support@sairentovr.com. We would love to work with you to find out why this is happening and help to resolve this freezing with you. Looking forward to hearing from you!
2022-05-28 15:22:28.075531,corprinus,A Pillar of Early VR,"This game seems to get mixed vibes from the community but I'm all for it, a solid game that gives us what we want in VR...longer games and/or high replay value with addictive gameplay. You can pretty much stab a guy in the neck while throwing a ninja star at another bad guy, run up a wall while dual wielding pistols like Lara Croft firing off rounds and jump down behind someone and slice them in half with your katana...all in one combo....in VR. Yea. So, that part about the game is true, you are basically Neo in the matrix, with bullet time included. Now, there are a few bugs in the game, but nothing that made me want to consider  not playing the game...fps drops here or there and slight difficulties with grabbing weapons sometimes (probably my lack of skill in the game), but nothing really bad. The movement system is not bad...I swear...it just makes you think, like a board game would. You have to plan ahead and not always move on impulse, that is probably where the movement issues are coming from. This game has enough weapons and loot to provoke long-term play and always presents a challenge. For those who want a game that allows you to play many different styles of badaxe-assassin-ninja, killing enemies and looking good while doing it, all while grabbing random loot, this game's for you....just be prepared to be challenged.","Jul 18, 2019 at 1:15 AM",5, 2,Thank you so much for the kind review as well as the 5 stars. We really appreciate it!
2022-05-28 15:22:31.200174,outsourcemusic,Love it! Might become my new favorite,"I bought this game a while ago on Steam, but I couldn't get into it for some reason & got a refund. I'm not sure what changed since then or I didn't go through the settings thoroughly but I'm really feeling this game now.  I wasn't a fan of the graphics at first but  after maxing the resolution I love the way everything looks.  I'm so glad they offered this free for the weekend because I totally overlooked this game, so I'm buying this!","Jul 15, 2019 at 12:07 PM",5, 0,I suppose a lot of things has changed ever since the earlier days.

2022-05-28 15:22:31.216131,AlienTB,Ninjas Just Rock,"I love this game. The graphics are excellent, it really captures the cyberpunk vibe I think it's going for. The player movement is perfect, I had some trouble at first but once you play for a bit it starts to become second nature. I also love the added dimension of the haptic feedback using the bHaptics vest.  When you get shot in the back you FEEL like you got shot in the back. So awesome. Highly recommend this game!!!","Jun 30, 2019 at 8:05 AM",5, 10,Awesome! Thanks so much for the kind support! Sure is fun as hell if you have the suit!

2022-05-28 15:22:31.232088,PoliceNavidad,"BEST GAME FOR VR, HANDS DOWN.","I don't need to say any more than that.. This game implements a large portion of VR's greatest mechanics, and they're SMOOTH, polished, and very professionally done.. This is game development like we're not used to anymore, ethics from days old that only classic games development teams can tell tale of. I don't have a single complaint for this game except for lack of advertisement to garner a larger playerbase.. But that might just be because they dump all their expendable funding in to DEVELOPMENT!","Jun 29, 2019 at 11:57 PM",5, 1,Thank you so much for the kind words. It sure means a lot to us and we couldn't agree with you more! We hope to keep on spinning the good o tales to people!

2022-05-28 15:22:34.348753,Hyomoto,,"Short version: the lack of polish shows across the board in terms of graphics, bugs and uneven gameplay.  It's novel, but the quality just isn't there.

Longer version: I appreciate what the developers are trying to do in Sairento, and it's great to see a game that is clearly trying to push VR as a medium.  The good parts are easy to sum up: the game has a lot of verticality and movement. You are encouraged to not be stationary and upright, and instead bob, weave and duck.  For many I suspect this is enough: there is a cyber-ninja fantasy in here somewhere that might be worth the price of admission.  For me, the ambition might have outpaced ability as the game lacks polish everywhere.  The controls simply do not work well enough.  The menus don't save options.  The levels and enemies lack much detail, and have little in the way of interaction or reaction.  The textures are basic.  The lighting is simplistic.  It's just not great, it's just okay.  It delivers somewhat on its promise, but doesn't do so with any substance or style.","May 28, 2019 at 4:59 AM",3, 4,"Hi there Hyomoto! Many thanks for playing Sairento VR and we heard your feedback. Indeed one of the selling points of Sairento VR is the vast amount of gameplay styles that is possible given the movements and weapons.

Could you try lowering the following and seeing if the issue persists?

- Resolution scale to x1.0 in Graphics
- Anti-aliasing to 2x or off in Graphics

2022-05-28 15:22:37.576120,theemarkhumenik,Brilliant. 2 handed Swordsman. LOVE THIS,"Well... this has become my go to game of late.
I purchased a while back. Tried it. Liked it... but not the controls.
Well... then I learned you can go in and change the settings.
Now... I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
The vibe is awesome. Click on missions and various missions appear on a map... and slowly disappear. Pick one.... and jump right in.
Double jumping. Running along walls. Surprise attacks by attacking after jumping off a roof. SLIDES. Jump... then slide. Slides with multiple kills is SO satisfying. Relics to find along the way. I am literally only days into the game... but it really is an absolute blast.
The developers continue to improve... and impress.
I believe there was a major graphical appearance overhaul the end of last year... and I find myself clearing a room... and then looking and exploring... taking it all in. The environments are a great blend of futuristic urban environments... and then traditional Japanese gardens and cemeteries. Again... awesome.
I love that in the urban setting l look up and the giant billboards are animated. Being on a boulevard that you can see traffic zipping by you underneath see thru sections. Little things that make it that much more immersive. 
And THEN... you have the abilities to ramp up your Armour with gems and goodies you collect along the way... increasing damage, health, and more.
Oh... and there are GUNS! Yes, you can choose to shoot rather than blade. BRILLIANT! I believe the only reason its not 5 stars overall is that it was a totally different playing / looking game when released.
Now it is for me... Epic. I love it. Give it an honest effort. Change the movement to allow slides. Then have a BLAST slicing and dicing. So satisfying. 5 Stars +++","Mar 9, 2019 at 11:35 PM",5, 9,"Thank you so much for the kind review! Yes indeed, somewhere along the line we made a decision to overhaul the entire game and actually spent months working on it. We do believe that we take pride in what we do and also wanted to make sure our players are really getting their money's worth. It was something we never regretted doing, although we could have spent our resources working on the next game, we really want to push ourselves to give our best before moving on.

With regards to Chieko and Hiro, we have originally intended for our female character to be the lead. However realising how popular the game was, we decided to add in a male character. To develop another storyline for the male character would certainly take up a decent amount of time and resources and it is something quite hard for us to work on as we are in the works for our next game!

2022-05-28 15:22:40.682811,Zyl0,"Quanity over Quality, not in a bad way","So to start Sairento is ambitious. The devs were trying to make the biggest VR game they can and they succeeded. This does however come at the detriment of the quality of that game, but that is something I willing to overlook in this case. While gunplay may feel better in games like robo recall compared to Sairento where guns physics are a little more limited, and the in game hands less representative of your actual hands, and be less buggy. But, Robo recall has 3 levels and a whopping 4 guns. Sairento has procedurally generated levels and triple that gun count. Add on Sairento’s mission modifiers, mods, and multiplayer and I will happily ignore the drop in quality for the sheer amount of content on display here. As of this posting an update for the game was posted 12 hours ago showing the devs are still working on this game and adding quality of life improvements. They are also quick to respond to user issues and suggestions.(go devs!)  Sairento is different then its competitors, and if you are looking for a shooter with a little more replay value then other vr shooters. Than this may be the game for you.","Feb 25, 2019 at 2:22 AM",4, 4,"Thank you so much for the wonderful support. Yes we do agree that there are some roughness around the edges and hence are continuously working round the clock to smoothen them up.

Stunts and combat are excellent though i was looking for full motion and not teleport for moving. Using a joystick for forward walking and jogging, left and right for strafing.

Update:

The no enemies problem was due to me destroying them all and deciding to experiment with various movements. Sorry I wasn't clear on that.  Id wish that their was an option to use true walking and running, everything else is top notch","Mar 3, 2019 at 7:44 AM",5, 2,"Hey thanks for giving us 5 stars.

2022-05-28 15:22:40.714726,Solomyn,Just what VR should be about,"I was apprehensive about purchasing this title.  But after watching Kill Bill, I had to sooth my inner ninja.  So... I took the plunge.  Very glad a did.  It's a very immersive experience.  The locomotion takes some getting used to, but once you do... it's incredible!  The manipulation of time while you're moving is awesome.

There are some glitches in the game I've experienced, but nothing too big.  While doing the campaign, there are times when the dialog is drowned out by the music.  Once again... although a small nuisance, it's not a dealbreaker (for me at least).

I gave this 5 stars even though there are some very small issues with it... the fact that the developers are responding to reviews, and are actively fixing the issue reported really says a lot about their work.

If you're looking for a great melee/sword action/FPS with a cyber twist... this is most certainly the game you're looking for.","Jan 19, 2019 at 1:25 PM",5, 7,"Dear kind sir, thank you so much for your support and 5 stars.

2022-05-28 15:22:40.730683,M0d1997,This game cannot be beaten!,"So, I have played borderlands. I have played Fallout, with mods. Skyrim even. I have played so many games, VR and otherwise, including handhelds. I played this at my friends house for HOURS during a between-work-sleepover and I have to say, I CANNOT get enough of it. There are problems- even if you have your VR legs you can get sick, easy. But, I give Sairento VR five stars for a few simple reasons- 

The gameplay- Its fantastic. The looting, ninja fighting, the story (a little shallow, but still!), and the movement, my LORD the movement. 

The community- Devs, please, I just can't say anything aside from positive things about the developers. There isn't entirely a community that I know of, but the developers HEARING us AND listening to the players is more than what most do, and it is more than welcome. 

These are just a few reasons I love the game. I myself in real life, have practiced ninjutsu (nothing like this game, I swear to you) and I still have to wonder- where did they get the idea? Where did the creative juices start flowing? How was this masterpiece made? If there was a game to buy, this is it. If you like action, if you like weapons, if you like RPG mechanics, then this is the game for you. I have never felt like a ninja, aside from playing this game. Sairento is the final stop for VR, and I cannot reccomend it enough. 

P.S. Hey devs, please keep up your responses to the community. Even if Sairento was terrible- listening and hearing your community is what would make it great. You have done exellent work, and I can't wait for your future games!

It's obvious the devs care about their game by the amount of updates they put out and their interaction with the community, so I'm adding a star to my review. Unfrotunately, the game is still broken.

2022-05-28 15:22:43.861310,Andramal,A nice mobility from superhot VR,"I like being able to move, jump, and use alternate things to attack the enemies. THe game is simple enough, but for a moment of hack'n'slash and sneak'n'stab, this is a nice upgrade.

The only grief I have right now is the random freeze/clipping it does. For me, it consistently does it in two specic level setups - the streets and the alley. 

The streets isn't so bad. it seems to have something to do with loading the next rooms once you get close enough, so if settings aren't too intense, you can wait it out a moment before going in.

The Alley, on the other hand.... Most often it's when you approach the last room, something over there is apparently very volatile, as if I'm even looking in that rooms general direction from the next room, I freeze and clip like crazy - thankfully the enemies half freeze with me, so I can run away, lure them to the previous room, then kill them before I go in.

I am guessing both of these issues are visual bugs of some sort, because at least when I'm in the alley, if I walk backwards to the exit point, I get much less flak from the room.

Otherwise, every other level design seems to work just fine with virtually no freezing spots.. Fix that, and I won't suffer so much. ^^","Jan 2, 2019 at 4:36 AM",4, 3,"Thanks so much for giving us a 4 stars! We really appreciate that.

2022-05-28 15:22:47.009888,NevlaAlwaysWins,Great game! But there are some issues...,"While this is my favorite game on the Rift right now, some things discourage me from playing it more. For example the progression system. Currently I am on stage 11, yet I have all legendary mods on ALL of my weapons and ALL my armor (which there should be more of by the way) and there's really no point trying to progress anymore. Sure it's kind of fun putting all your points into melee and punching people halfway across the room, but other than trying random builds, it gets a little stale. Campaign is currently go in > Shoot some people > Maybe die once > Restart if I died > Win in about 5 minutes. It doesn't feel interactive once you've maxed out. There should be A LOT more on the progression side of things.

As well as that, there are some QoL issues too. If you want to see your players arms and body, you can't have the arm thing enabled, so your hands are about 3 inches back from where there should be when fully extended infront of you. You can't turn with the joystick more than once on a wall run before being breought out of it (might be intentional I don't know.) A LOT of things aren't labeled in the menu. And a really annoying one that may just be a bug in general is that when you backflip by raising your hands, the perspective flips. What was on your right is now on your left and what was on your left is now on your right. Which just, not how backflips work lol.

BUT despite all of the issues with it, it is 100% worth your money and will remain one of your favorite games for a long time!","Nov 12, 2018 at 11:45 AM",5, 1,"Hey thanks for giving us a fabulous 5 stars! Really appreciate it! So yeah we get it that on some parts of the game is a bit rough on the edges and where things can be improved, we are on it. So a new patch will be dropping which will consist of a lot of fixes, optimizations, new maps and even new acrobatic stunts - so you can even perform moves like somersaults and sideflips in mid air! Additionally, you'll be able to turn more than once while in a wall run or in a jump, so the experience should be improved.

Expect this to come around the coming weeks ahead or so!"
2022-05-28 15:22:47.026843,yureveru,,"Movement makes me dizzy, I thought it's teleporting-style game. Well, it's not. All jumps and double jumps need locomotion.

Yes, deep inside options you can disable jumps, which I did first thing.

But then the initial tutorial is blocked, as first thing you need to do there is double jump.

Also, I was hoping for some swords fun like in Beat Saber, but with more then cubes. But swords don't do physics interaction with enemies at all. So, not fancy at all.","Nov 13, 2018 at 6:46 PM",1, 0,"Hey Yureveru, many thanks for playing Sairento VR. The tutorial was intended to provide players an opportunity to get a sense of the Sairento experience. We understand that the movement might not be everyone's cup of tea but on the flip side, we do have plenty of players enjoying the wide choice of movements and gameplay. The interesting thing about VR at the moment is that we can never get everyone agreeing on the best movement mechanics hence we do our best to cater to as wide audiences as we can through various options. We understand there might also be areas where we fall short of and sincerely hope you can play the game again soon come in a couple more weeks time. That is when we will roll out additional content coupled with more improvements. If you think we have done better and deserve more than just a star, we'll really appreciate it."
2022-05-28 15:22:47.042800,Hit-Bit,A good game with some minor bugs,"I personally prefer to play most VR games with free locomotion and tried to set it up for this game as well. But when moving the left stick forward or backward the movement of the character sometimes moves smooth and sometimes it seems to dash/teleport a few meters in that direction instantly and I couldn't find another option to prevent this from happening. And it happens intermittently, while holding the left stick in one direction.

But for the rest the game feels great and I trust the developer will improve the game over time to fix this minor issue.

So if you are not into free locomotion or don't mind then this could be a great game for you, but if free locomotion is a must then I would advise to wait a little longer until it is fixed. The developer really added loads of options to try to make the game suitable for almost everyone and cares about their customers.","Nov 1, 2018 at 3:49 AM",4, 0,"Hi there, thanks for giving us 4 stars! We appreciate that. Just would like to look more into the movement you mentioned?

Can I check if you are pushing down on the joystick when this happens? Clicking down on it will instead revert to the dash/jump function, which may lead to the behaviour you are seeing. 

If the issue still persists, you can always reach out to us at support@sairentovr.com and we'll be happy to assist! If it is something that is really a bug, it would be helpful for us to squash it also! :)"
2022-05-28 15:22:47.059755,MetallicTempest,"""Unpolished"" = Skydiving Simulator","This seems a lot more than just unpolished. Falling through the level has so far been the most common cause of death. I mean honestly, 3/4 of the attempts at any mission or the tutorial have ended in just falling.

The first mission is intensely difficult for a first teir one mission on standard difficulty. Unfortunately a major part of that difficulty is not being able to reload or block anything and having enemies even aim where I'm about to jump to making it impossible to dodge anything.

There was a calibration menu in the intro, but nothing I did would opperate the adjustments and trying other buttons exited it and I could never find that screen again. I can't help but think I'm falling through the ground because of the calibration but I couldn't operate it or get back to it. 

My advise for the developer if they read this is to do some basic user testing. Get random people to try basic tasks in your game and if any of them can't do it then get a UX person to offer some feedback. I think you'll find that weapons need a more generous reload area and you have got to cut some talking in the campaign. A lot of text was centered very low on my screen and was unreadable because it was under the street. Then the missions start out way too hard. Put some easy ones in there so people can get used to it. But last, you have got to fix the falling through surfaces issue. It makes the game arbitrarily much harder, and falling for several seconds at a time when you don't expect it is extremely unpleasent. At least put boundary boxes at some point where people auto die so we don't keep falling.

This game has the potential to be so cool, I will keep an eye on it, seriously. But it's just unfinished right now, not unpolished. I don't see why I should give them money to finish it. I played 22 minutes and fell through the ground/walls at least 12 times. That's just unacceptable.","Oct 27, 2018 at 1:31 PM",1, 1,"Hi there, really sorry to hear about your experience - let us attempt to get to the bottom of the bugs you are experiencing, and address the other issues.

- On falling through the level :
Firstly, if you happen to have any recordings of falling through the level, it would greatly help if you could send them over to support@sairentovr.com so that we can find out what exactly is going on. We understand that it can be very frustrating when it happens, but we need to understand if this is due to an error in the level, or a physics issue tied to the framerate, or perhaps a calibration issue. 

- On the calibration menu :
This launches at the start of the game, but you can re-access it through the ""Calibration"" button at the the bottom of the Options menu. Could you let us know in more detail which adjustments you were having issues with? The important one to note is the sliding height (this can cause you to keep sliding off edges if not calibrated correctly).

- On the difficulty :
We recommend playing the levels first on the lowest difficulty (Casual), which makes the experience much more stress-free and focuses on the fun. It is not meant to be a knock on your abilities, rather more a reflection of the kind of experience this is. Please let me explain.

At its heart, Sairento is a very physical experience - on standard difficulty, the game concept is one where you are incentivized to be physical and mobile in the play area, ducking and dodging attacks and leaping around. While rewarding to pull off, we also recognize that everyone measures fun and a sense of accomplishment in different ways. 

Blocking bullets and melee attacks is possible with any of the swords, and while it is not easy to start with, using the Accelerate (slow-mo) ability to achieve that is something we want players to do to define that experience of ""moving fast"" and being a cyber ninja. 

- On reloading :
Under the control options, you can enable auto reload, or change the reload mode to shaking upwards or downwards. This makes reloading much less of a chore, but takes away from the experience for some gamers - we think either experience is valid and it should be up to you if you prefer one way over the other. 

- On text being centered too low :
In the next patch, we are adding an option to display the text on the wrist menu instead, rather than being tied to your headset. This should help with the readability issues!

Thanks for reading this, and do contact us at support@sairentovr.com with more details as we really do hope to help you make the experience how it was meant to be."

Still haven't found a way to stop this. The movement is good when it works but so often it doesn't and immediately pulls you out of the moment.

Edit to Dev Response: Yes, the touchpad locomotion. When I start to use it my character jerks forward a few feet, then starts to move smoothly.","Oct 29, 2018 at 1:37 AM",3, 0,"Hi, we'd love to know more about this issue you are experiencing so we can fix this for you. By movement with the touchpad, do you mean touchpad locomotion (walking with the joystick) or attempting to jump by pushing forward the joystick?"
2022-05-28 15:22:50.172430,sephethus,"Nope, Still Buggy","This game has potential I'll give it that.

Feedback:
1. If you can duck by physically crouching, why can't you jump that way as well? 
2. The guns should be holstered on your hips, not in front of you.
3. Too many buttons that do the same thing. There's no need for rotation in VR either, you can just turn around physically. (see bug) It's way too easy to hit the a/b/x/y buttons while just trying to teleport with the stick. It should be one or the other. I keep accidentally moving around when I don't want to move.
4. Scrolling the menus in the DoJo is non-intuitive and frustrating. Using the trigger rather than the A button to select is annoying, the trigger is already assigned to scrollling down, so selection is difficult. Accidentally jumping around is also annoying when trying to use these menus and options.

Bugs:
1. Lots of graphical bugs with where your body is relative to where you are. The feet are inside the ground or floating above it, but never on top of it. The feet are locked to a position and the body stretches awkwardly to where you're standing, showing the body needs a ton of work. I turned it off for now. 
2. Turning off rotation doesn't stick. The setting reverts back instantly.
3. Moving to the location of an enemy doesn't put you where you think it would be relative to where he is. He ends up too far away despite the point targeted being directly next to him.","Oct 26, 2018 at 3:42 AM",3, 0,"Hi there! Many thanks for your kind feedback and we are grateful for your time spent and seeing the potential of Sairento VR. 

We do agree that there are some rough edges which we are currently working on it further to fine-tune the experience. There are some points raised we thought we could reply to.

1. With regards to the duck and jump, we did thought of that but it would run into conflict with other actions such as duck and slide. Also our game mechanics is such that the jump follows an arc so we don't have much a free jump.

2. Body and guns not holstered properly. This seem strange to us. We suspect it could be due to improper calibration. Would you be so kind as to try calibrate again and see if the problem persists? If so we would love to hear about it with a screenshot (support@sairentovr.com)

3. Moving to location where enemy's position changes. As the dash/teleport is not instantaneous, it is possible that during this time that the enemy has moved a bit so we think that could be the case.

At any case, please feel free to drop us an email (support@sairentovr.com) if you think there are more issues while we work on the rest of the bugs :)"
2022-05-28 15:22:50.189384,CMDRLawliet,I've gotta recommend this to you guys.,"This is an update on the review that I left around 8 months ago after Saireto VR had just left Early Access.

I complained heavily about a lack of polish on the game and several consistent game-breaking bugs.

However, I'm really, really pleased to say that as of Version 1.4.1b, the game has really improved.

The game's bugs, while still present at times, are very minor and nothing compared to the monstrous glitches that plagued the game before. This was a major dealbreaker for me when I first started playing but now that it's been significantly patched and updated, it doesn't really bother me in the slightest. Sure, you'll get the occasional random particle effect floating in mid-air, or the animation for your hands will break, but it's nothing that majorly affects gameplay.

I'm also happy to say that the game now feels a lot more structured and professional. The progression system still needs a bit of work, I feel, but it has come miles from where it used to be and it's still enjoyable.

All in all, I can't recommend this game enough now. Definitely pick it up if you get the chance because the devs have done an amazing job at picking this thing up off the ground and I can only hope that they continue to keep up the great work!! :DDD","Sep 24, 2018 at 7:15 PM",4, 9,"Thank you so much for giving us a recommendation.

As far as complaints go, there aren't any that take away from the experience in my opinion. There could stand to be slightly more enemy variety, but the mission modifier system addresses this pretty well. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but the art style and detail put into the game is impressive as well. It can be difficult to find people to play with online, but that's a problem with most VR games as the player base is small, and is not the fault of the developers.

The teleporting motion feels free, and the controls quickly become intuative. Weapon buffs and leveling up make the game deep, survival mode is a lot of fun.  Aside from a few glitches, I have no complaints about this game whatsoever.  Technical stuff happens from time to time, might get stuck in a wall... I just moved around til I got unstuck, and came back to the action.  I'm sure stuff like that will get polished up.
The gameplay is solid and interesting, and the difficulty levels let you decide how hard you want to work each mission.  This game is everything I was hoping for in VR.

Was excited to see it come to home as I was hoping for some native performance improvements but instead I got was weird alignment issues and an overall worse experience. Every weapon is slightly higher in your hand than in the steam version, and the bow just spazzes around wildy, yet all is still fine in the steam version. Waste of money.","Jun 16, 2018 at 11:03 AM",2, 10,"Hey Wrightboy, appreciate that you actually got this version as well.

2022-05-28 15:22:59.689974,AutisticJew,"Still kinda of glitchy, but a great game","This game can become something great, but it has some game breaking glitches. There is nothing worst than jumping around, shooting people, and having fun then you fall out of the map and complete the mission. I have exactly what are the recomended specs for the game and still run into performance issues, like random crashes, frame rate freeezes, and ect. When I do run into these issues, it really brings me out of the immersion of the game. I really do enjoy the game when it does work correctly. For $39.99 USD, it's kinda of expensive for a        non-finished game. I would buy only on sale. For the current state this game is in and price I would give it a 7.5/10. If there was no glitches it would be a 10/10.","Jun 11, 2018 at 12:12 AM",3, 1,"Hey thanks for giving Sairento VR a go! We are working on the optimizations in our current PS porting and will definitely come back togive the PC version performance a boost soon. 

We look forward for a 10/10 :) But in the meantime, we'll take a 7.5 and grateful for your patience. BTW I believe its $29.99? Not $39.99 USD."

But when I first played it, it was just weird. With the player model on the arms of the character were way too short, which made me use the hands only, Which was ok for me. But what really made me want to refund the was the jumping. Everytime i try to jump right in front of an enemy to hit him with the sword i placed me further away then it should have and is missed with sword. This problem took the entire fun away from me because I couldn't really play with the sword without jumping twice in a row. But don't understand me wrong. I still think this game is great but with those jumps I don't really wanna play it. The other bugs I encountered didn't really bothered me and I even glitched out of the first level after the tutorial within less then 2 minutes. I can still recommend the game but for me there is no reason to play it with those jumps.","May 30, 2018 at 1:08 AM",3, 1,"Hey thanks for playing Sairento VR. Like to check if you actually did some calibrate for your avatar during the initial stage?

2022-05-28 15:22:59.722886,nickdavies,Turns out being a ninja is Awesome!,"I have had a great time playing this game so far. At first it was pretty good but after I got the hang of the controls it became one of my favorite games so far for Oculus!

I LOVE the motion mechanics. The teleport style choice of movement with slow mo and then actually jumping/dashing instead of teleport is my favorite part of the game. This makes the action feel really fluid and gives a much more immersive experience compared to things like RoboRecall, Raw Data etc. 

I found the action very engaging. Jumping through the air, sliding with your sword out to the side and cutting some unsuspecting ninja in half is great. 

The only negative I would say is that the controls of this game took me a while to get used to, specifically around camera control. I have front facing (although i ordered another sensor for this game) and it can be a bit tricky keeping myself faced at the sensors without it interrupting the flow of the game.

Overall I am really happy with this game and would recommend to others but you need to give it an hour or two of playing with the controls before they feel really comfortable.","May 7, 2018 at 8:38 AM",5, 3,Glad to know you had fun! Thanks for giving us a 5 Star rating :) Means a lot to our team!
2022-05-28 15:22:59.739840,Albertthedragonchild,I want to love it,"Unfortunally the controls are horrible.
The game premise on teleporting which is my favorite. However the teleport is horrible.
When you teleport/jump you cant choose which way you are going to face. You have to manually select while you are jumping/teleporting by flicking the stick and its only left ,forward, back or right.  Im also extremly annoyed that somtime you just teleport slighty and it goes so fast you have no chance to react unless you press another button to slow things down. Anyway, Im not gonna ask for a refund since Im hoping they will fix this. The game itself looks good and the parcour is fun and intresting but it suffers because of the other things i wrote.
BE WARNED.","May 7, 2018 at 4:31 AM",2, 3,"Hi thank you for purchasing the game and we really appreciate your patience in not asking for a refund.

The amount of weapons customization you can do is really impressive and makes it feel more serious than something like Robo Recall. Bouncing around and slicing up the bad guys is really fun, and surprisingly challenging. However, in the later levels when there are a lot of enemies coming at you, and a whole bunch of bullets flying around, the performance seriously suffers. At first it's the throwing mechanics for projectile weapons, then the actual graphics stutter heavily. Mind you, my rig runs Robo Recall on hard mode, full of baddies, without breaking a sweat. I think with some proper optimization this game has amazing potential.","Apr 7, 2018 at 4:32 AM",3, 5,Hey really appreciate and thanks for playing Sairento VR. We are glad you had enjoyed it.

2022-05-28 15:23:06.035003,Marzoval,Solid VR action for ultimate badassery,"This game does a great job with mixing traditional combat systems with an innovative locomotion system, making for some slick and fluid gameplay that is very fun and addictive. 


The game's concept is pretty simple for the most part - pick a map, pick a mission type, and start killing baddies in any way you like, whether it's through guns blazing, sword slashing, or throwing projectiles, or a combination of all. But most importantly, kill them with STYLE. 


My personal favorite weapons are the bow & arrow and throwing knives as they feel very satisfying to use and make kills with. 


The gunplay unfortunately is pretty lacking - there's zero sense of recoil and power when you pull the trigger, no matter what sort of mods you add in to increase their damage. They just feel ""thin"" and styrofoam-like. Additionally, the swords don't feel that great either as you don't need to slash for the game to register hits. A lot of my sword kills feel more accidental than earned. Something just feels off about them that swinging them don't feel all that satisfying to do and make kills with. 


Other than that, the gameplay is solid when combining the different ways to clear rooms, and the various mods and skills that progress your character helps give the game some longevity.","Mar 4, 2018 at 11:08 AM",4, 6,"Thanks for playing Sairento VR! We do appreciate your support and feedback as well. Regarding the interactivity such as the weapons, it's something we are taking into consideration seriously on how to be better in the future :)"
2022-05-28 15:23:06.051958,DocRocks0,Best game I've played in VR,"As someone who'se played almost every major VR shooter to-date, Sairento is my favorite. The graphics and general polish aren't on the same level as something AAA like Robo Recall, but no other game offers the freedom of movement (running, jumping, double/triple jumps, wallruns, walljumps, back/frontflips, slides, etc.) and attacking options that this one does, in my experience. 

In short, it is like Raw Data / Robo Recall combined with Windlands. It is so much fun that I'm more than willing to re-purchase the native Oculus version now that it has finally been released!","Feb 7, 2018 at 5:13 AM",5, 33,Thank you Doc for supporting us! :) Appreciate being our first 5 star review too!

The locomotion is unique with options for free movement/turn and bullet time is well done, if you like to run along walls with UZIs/Katanas/Ninja Stars like your in the Matrix that is. Progression system is well, currently second to none with a variety of weapon stat/armor/relic upgrades as you progress through missions(single or co-op). The graphics are good but could be better IMA but they DO actively work on updates so I don't have any complaints as I know it will improve.

This game even allows for creative combat much like Robo Recall, though I do wished the game allowed us to throw an empty gun against enemies for additional damage, which would definitely allow for some sick combos.

Thank you for giving us 5 stars!"
2022-05-28 15:23:09.222478,Mayonnaiseman,The potential is beautiful,"After seeing the trailer for this game, I bought it instantly.  Let me sum up the experience really quick to see if this is something you want to go forward with -

Pros : 
You can literally jump anywhere, unlike the other FPS games where it is 'teleport only' movement.  The still have the teleport mechanic, but jumping is so much cooler, and it's not bad on the motion sickness, they did a very good job with it.
-Huge variety of weapons you don't have to unlock, so you can try and customize the loadout right from the start.
-The slow mo feels extremely awesome when you are deflecting bullets or wall running while unloading your clips

CONS
-This still feels very Alpha-esque for a few reasons.
-The hitboxes for the swords and melee range seem very off.  You almost have to be inside the enemy for it to register that you are hitting them, and when you do actually hit or shoot them, there is little to no recoil effect, (other than the hp bar lowering) so it is not very satisfying slashing someone with a sword or shooting someone in the head and they just keep staring at you.
-The physics feel beautiful, but if you play this game at all multiplayer, the model of the avatar while they are moving around is the nastiest thing ever.  Picture T-Pose models literally floating around on the walls, it is pretty horrifying. I'd strongly recommend staying away from co-op (or VS) for a while, hopefully they update the animations, because they're horrendous. 
-There's a twonky feeling to grabbing the weapons from their holsters, it seems that no matter which way you grab them or how you have your presets (even after doing the beginning arm's length and height mapping) sometimes you will grab the weapon and itll teleport back to it's holster, or you will take out your sword and it'll be held upside down, despite you grabbing it the correct way.  It makes your intense fight scene pretty comical.
It's extremely fun, dont get me wrong, Buy it ONLY for the single player so far.","Feb 9, 2018 at 12:32 PM",3, 15,"Hey kind sir, first up on behalf of our team, we like to thank you for the good stuffs mentioned are grateful for that some of the unique features such as free movement is something you find enjoyable.

I'm not sure if the following points would answer or help you with regards to some of the situations mentioned. So let's try :) 

- Agreed about the T-post avatars so that is something we are looking into.

- Regarding weapon holsters, can you try disabling sticky grip in the control options and quick weapon switching in accessibility to see if it helps? This brings in more in line with other Oculus experiences, at the expense of making weapons switching slightly slower

- For upside down swords, it is actually a feature you can disable (allow reverse grip in control options) Its really just meant for players to look cooler when they slash in a reverse manner for the fun of it. Disabling means you only draw the sword in a vertically upright position.

- Regarding hit-boxes, you have to be swinging with a minimum speed for swords to register a hit. Some emnemies are also immune to stuns and flinches in certain states (e.g, when the Bushi is charging up their sword attack)

Hopefully the above helps in some ways? While we are rolling out patches progressively, do feel free to drop us a note at support@sairentovr.com if they aren't helpful at this point so we can learn from your feedback on how we can be better.

Cheers!"
2022-05-28 15:23:09.240430,FoxyBoxes22,"Action Packed, but Awkward","So I played this for an hour or so for the first time today, and I can comfortably say that this game is cool and very interesting, but is awkward and lacks a lot of polish.

Disclaimer, I only have two sensors, so I couldn't play with 360 degree tracking and my Graphics card is only slightly above the recomenmded specs for VR.

I'll start with the good stuff:
Movement is AWESOME!
Weapon designs are fantastic.
Lots of weapon choices!
Music is action packed and also can be changed on the fly.
This game is built to be a power trip, and it in some ways nails it!
The skill trees add some much needed depth!

Now the bad stuff...
Glitchy. I fell through the floor within my first 30 minutes and had to reset the level because I was stuck under the map.
Weapons are inaccurate and you can't hold them quite right. If it says anything, the sword is held forward about 30 degrees too much and the guns are slightly off from what they should be. Iron sights are also garbage.
The environments repeat too much and some seem really uninspired and thrown together.
The beginning of the campaign was AWFUL. I could only play two chapters of the campaign before getting fed up with it. Avoid it.
The AI responds to your movement almost too well, so it makes doing movement tricks frustrating at times.
The game is easy to cheese. Just slide around everywhere with your sword out and flail it around. You can't lose that way.
The bullet time tends to stop right as you shoot a bullet, which I found incredibly disappointing.
The holsers don't seem as responsive as they should be, so when I got into really fast combat, I wouldn't be able to grab my weapons properly.

Overall, would I say you should get this game? Not now. It just doesn't feel done. I probably wont play it much more until some of the bugs and wonkiness is ironed out. If it goes on a better sale and is less than $15? Then it might be worth getting if the Devs are going to fix it up.","Feb 7, 2018 at 11:17 AM",2, 16,"Hey, thanks so much for playing Sairento VR. We do sincerely apologise if you did not have as much a good experience as we hoped. Yes we do recognize some of the points mentioned are valid and are working on improving the experience.

Regarding difficulty level, may we suggest if you are up for a challenge, you could try the Shinobi highest level. That might give you a heart pumping action as you do really need to avoid those bullets, like a true ninja!

Just past the tutorial, I realised that I couldnt turn left. Well. Now all I want to do is turn left. (Both control options of Free movement and snap turn do not work) ... How The F... Why?  I dont expect a finished game yet. But movement seems like one of those things you would want 'licked' before releasing to the wild. The patch of 2/8/2018 did not fix it. I will reassess in 13 days. Which is the amount of time I have before I cant return this game anymore. I dont care about other bugs. But this one kills it for me.

2022-05-28 15:23:12.368065,neocaleric,Great ninja fun.,"I've been following the development of Sairento on Steam for a while, waiting for it to arrive on the Oculus Store. Now that it's finally here i got it and after my first play session it was worth the wait.  There are a few thing that could be improved but as far as the first release version of the game i feel it's a great experience. It takes a while to calibrate the game to suit your body type. Many people is not patient enough to go deeper into this initial setup and that seems to be ruining the experience. For starters i'd recommend making your body somehow visible all times during calibration so you understand how the height setup affects your character. I also found my arms felt too short in-game so i had to use the longer arms option that regretably disabled the body model. Would like to have a way to have both. This made the hand positioning more accurate but still needs a bit of work. Anyway after that initial bump it was fun discovering how each weapon works and all the things you can do with them. Perhaps adding a tutorial for the various weapons with an option to spar against AI on the dojo would be a welcome addition for a future patch. Also would be cool to have japanese voices with all text and subs in english since i enjoy japanese style games like this.  I gave it 5 stars because i've seen how the devs respond to feedback and they've always worked hard to make the game into the best experience we can get. It shows in the locomotion they have achieved. That alone makes it worth playing.","Feb 8, 2018 at 8:28 AM",5, 7,"Thank you and thank you so much. We really appreciate your support.

2022-05-28 15:23:12.421921,Yoshi-Senpai,,"I would be spending more time in-game. However, my character always crouched so i was unable to jump. Couldn't get past the tutorial. Tried Rest Calibration, sensor setup, none of them worked. the game tells you your knees should not be bent; but doesn't tell you how to calibrate. Or the shorter and taller buttons don't work.

One other thing that shorten my game time, was holding the swords like pistols, in elimination. Also, you could kill these guys with a sneeze with the blades.","Feb 7, 2018 at 9:11 AM",1, 7,"Hey thanks for giving Sairento VR a go. So sorry to hear about your situation and we would  love to help you out. Can we check if you were able to jump with the shifting forward stick or the A button?

In terms of calibration, were you able to get to a screen that allows you to adjust your height n stuffs like that? 

At any rate, we would love to get in touch with you and understand better to help with this. If you don't mind, would you please drop us an email at support@sairentovr.com so we could discuss more and give you our fullest support?"
2022-05-28 15:23:12.439872,ScoobyDum,Ninja Robo Recall,"Really darn fun, fast paced action. Seems to be very buggy and Touch is not implemented very well, its just functional. Will randomly stop responding, when turning using Touch, really seems like it was made for the competitor and half ported to Home. Lots of customization options for movement, probably one of the best locomotion hands down.","Feb 7, 2018 at 1:15 PM",3, 2,"Hey Scooby, first of all thanks for purchasing Sairento VR. It was indeed first implemented on other platforms and hence there could be some distances apart but we like to assure you that it's something we are working on. We also found out that the swords weren't aiming as correct as we would love to so our team is on it. Please do give us a bit of time to work/fix this and hopefully we can give you a better experience.

Thanks for letting us know you had fun still!"

10/10 Would mess up wall again.","Feb 13, 2018 at 1:19 AM",5, 13,"Ahh, we are so sorry about the wall! Hopefully you didn't hurt yourself! Thank you for giving us a 5 star review :)

Can't recommend this game in it's current state.,"Feb 10, 2018 at 12:53 PM",3, 7,"So sorry that we are giving you a bad time kind sir.

If you can replicate it again you would be kind enough please to drop us a mail at support@sairentovr.com so that we could fix it up for you as well as other players?
