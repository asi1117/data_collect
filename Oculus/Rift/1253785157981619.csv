2022-05-28 14:15:09.786099,Nerfgund,This is a must buy for sea animal lovers,"Wow.  I've scuba dived/snorkeled with manatee, sea turtles, sharks, dolphins, jelly fish, and a bunch of other animals in real life before and this game seems extremely realistic to me.  Of course not completely so cause we are in 1st gen VR but pretty real.  

 There is a lot of variety in the animals they show.  They have educational information which is great for kids but if you don't want to hear it, you can even turn off the triggers completely.  

The controls are very well done as is the sound.  I really do get the same kind of feeling as if I was really scuba diving and moving in the water (when using smooth locomotion or the grip buttons for thrust).

For the price, I think the length of the game is good too.   It's not a long game but it is also a low price.  It's hard for me to say how long it is cause I just sit there watching the animals sometimes.  It's really peaceful for me so I will certainly be reviewing this app often just to relax.

The only thing I didn't like was the pattern the bubbles exited your mouth.  It doesn't look realistic for a scuba diver.  But that is an extremely minor complaint and this game is a must buy imo if you want to feel like you are really swimming/scuba diving with these magical underwater creatures.","Dec 27, 2019 at 11:10 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 14:15:09.802057,maxrob0001,Great simulation,This is a very realistic underwater simulation. I like that there are educational aspects of learning about what you see. It would be good if there were more animals though. I like the way you move around using your hand controls. My favourite is the dolphins. It would be good if you could take photos of the animals and view them on your computer.,"Apr 22, 2019 at 5:58 PM",4, 18,

2022-05-28 14:15:12.948243,Astrachron,An Amazing Experience!,"It is wonderful to be among these beautiful sea creatures. There is no game, just experiencing being under the sea. Virtually zero load times and a great way of moving around. The animation of the creatures is very realistic.

There are collission detection problems with a sea snake swiming through a large rock and a fish partially going through a whale and a turtle. I also apeared in the shark cage with my head sticking through the top of it. Also when going above the surface there is nothing there. (I know it's all about being under the sea, but it's fun watching dolphins leaping out of the water and it would be nice to see waves, sky and the moon etc. maybe even a tropical island).  These problems break the illusion that you are really under the sea, which apart from these is very believable.  I hope the developers will work on these issues and also make the fish a bit more wary of people when you get very close, which would be more realistic and would avoid fish etc. going through one's head.

Don't let all this put you off, It's a very relaxing and beautiful experience that is well worth purchasing.

I suggest having the option to turn off the fireworks as the dolphins go through hoops and perhaps adding some other toys, and would like to see an exploration mode where you don't know which creatures you will see rather than just selecting a creature type, and also adding some sort of adventure or quest activities would be nice, along with the option to play music, preferably my own (please add this as it would make a huge difference, as listening to a chillout album while sitting under the sea with dolphins etc. would be so cool!)

Even without any modification, it's a must have for anyone wanting to experience scuba diving or just to chill out in a relaxing beautiful environment. A big thank you to the makers! Please keep improving it and making more great software.","Feb 10, 2019 at 10:53 AM",4, 8,

2022-05-28 14:15:12.978163,nightcat.mau,Beautiful Yet Disappointing,"This is a pretty beautiful experience allowing you to swim with a wide variety of ocean animals. You can see rays, sharks and even sea snakes as well as manatees up close and personal, so five stars for all the friendly encounters and info. But it also has a dark ride experience with the great white and no info on the shark which was disappointing. You can’t even feed him and the otherwise intelligent and shy shark just mindlessly rams your diving cage.

Same with the dinosaurs. You could either actually explore or get instantly eaten. I get it, they wanted something more exciting, but a mock attack or threat display would have worked just as well.

TLDR Beautiful app, but there’s nothing educational in the great white encounter.","Dec 2, 2018 at 5:50 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 14:15:16.107895,WG1,Feels like diving,"Had to respond to the confused reviews. Must have been a big update because nothing like the bad reviews. The video demo is from ingame, and is an accurate preview, so if you like the video, that's what you get.

Using CV1 on i7, GTX 1070 system with Touch controllers, NOT a phone, OK?

Been years since I've been diving and this recreated the experience for me, plus swimming with animals I've never been close to until now (in VR :).

Amazing for under 800KB download, full of great environments and realistic sealife. Yes , there is a sea bottom with interesting features, but that is not the vocus of the experience. (someone wrote ""no sea bottom"" ? ? )

Smooth movement  with the propellors , keeping up with dolphins, marlin, orcas, prehistoric creatures, etc. 

Favorite environment is Blue shark, more shallow area with bright lighting, although the deep abyss scenes are scary and amazing.

Love the controls, B for menu, A for dropping stuff in the water, triggers for propellor, very cool.

Maybe the bad reviews promted a huge update because what they describe is not the current version. Thanks !","Feb 21, 2018 at 10:24 PM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 14:15:19.217685,jimmyaward,A fun time,Me and my Girlfriend enjoyed exploring the scenes. Some are too scary for me but she was loving it. Overall worth it if you know what you're getting - you're essentially getting several large fish tanks that you can swim in and explore with minimal interaction!,"Jan 11, 2018 at 2:10 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 14:15:19.233642,orlaag,seriously overpriced and lacking polish,"Even if it was a free tech demo (all this is) I'd only give it 3 stars at most. I suspect a lot of the 5 stars or recommendations are paid reviews. The meshes are very low detail, the environments are very poorly done and not realistic at all (they oversized aquarium models and repeated them throughout environment so it is more like a VR fishtank). The culling/collision detection is very poor to none existent and the behaviour of wildlife not very realistic nor varied. I expected more because of the reviews but it is basically quality of a 5min free tech demo you'd never go back to but cost as much as better options. Wish I could get a refund easily. Fwiw I think The Blu suffers from similar drawbacks but at least has realistic looking environment and fish reactions.","Dec 21, 2017 at 12:19 PM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 14:15:19.264559,FastLawyer,It's overall better than theBlu because,"I have and like theBlu.  It's definitely one of those beginner VR must have experiences.  However, comparing this experience to theBlu is ridiculous.  TheBlu is a seated or standing experience.  You cannot teleport or move beyond your roomscale.  Your interactions are very limited.   The experience is more like a movie as well, scripted events happen.  And the ambient mode is more like a screen saver.  In this game, you don't really have scripted events or a loop, but actual ocean life that responds differently (coded responses).  For example, whenever I tried to swim towards the dolphins they would sometimes approach me and look at me inquisitively but not always.  And if I tried to reach out to grab them, they would usually swim away quickly.  You can use your touch controllers to swim (little propellers) around the ocean area.  You will see different things each time.  Do you prefer almost photo-realistic underwater experience?  Then you will prefer theBlu.  Do you prefer exploration and spontaneous moments?  Then you will prefer Ocean Rift.  I like both.  But the above reasons is why I prefer Ocean Rift.  Plus you can grab most of the smaller fish and the pink jellyfish :D  My biggest complaint is the collision detection and how you'll go through some objects, including the dolphins or whales which totally breaks any immersion.  Still, this game is a bargain at $5 and I highly recommend this and theBlu.","Sep 29, 2017 at 11:33 AM",4, 18,

2022-05-28 14:15:22.369405,Aden777,Mindblowing,"Some of the models are inconsistant and a few look cheap, but others are almost photorealistic. The Great White encounter is AMAZING! I consider my Rift purchase worth while for just this.

The whales, dolphines and seals along with a few others are also extremely cool. Ocean Rift is something I can easy and quickly startup and relax.","Oct 20, 2017 at 8:17 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:15:22.384365,PoolfanVr,Nice educational experience,"Very immersive experience, really feels and sounds like you are underwater and being able to examine the creatures movements and characteristics up close is fantastic.  Often the experience is unsettling which is a compliment as it highlights a degree of realism.  The graphics are good enough but not photo realistic but I found did not detract from the experience.

2022-05-28 14:15:22.414286,digholm,Not quite up to expectation,"Quite immersive, even to a degree where it's a bit frightening, but not quite up to expectation. What broke immersion was the horribly low polygon count and low-resolution textures. Also, the bottom of the ocean was flat, no real geometry, and the whole experience lacked depth. The colors were also a little too saturated and the water was more that of a pool than of an ocean. Most but not all animation were choppy too. Some collision detection issues, or rather a lot. Has potential, but not quite up to expectation.","Oct 1, 2017 at 2:02 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 14:15:28.707672,Tankshell,"Pretty good, but lacks polish","Bought this back when I first received my CV1 and have enjoyed many hours relaxing and just watching the various well animated underwater species go about their business. Recent update to support Oculus Touch however seems a bit of a gimmick for the time being, no additional interactivity is offered with the fish, for example you cannot wave your hands to make them scatter, or feed them etc, bit of a missed oppotunity to do something really cool.","Dec 8, 2016 at 1:35 AM",3, 19,
2022-05-28 14:15:28.722632,solisis,Great for kids,"Not sure what people are complaining about exactly. I have a 4 year old who loves to just look at things in rift. This is a good example of something pretty to look at with a touch of mild humor. Imagine seeing a 4 year old in the shark cage. It's pretty funny. My only real complaint is that sometimes you choose a creature to view and they're nowhere to be found. Aside that, if there was just a reef mode where there's significantly more fish around just to look at and move with the schools that would be cool. The waters can seem oddly unpopulated at times.","Jan 9, 2017 at 10:34 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:15:28.738590,Bel-garath,Excellent Experience,"This is one of those top quality experiences to simply relax and enjoy the sites around you. Graphically I think it is actually pretty well done. I think for the most part they swim realistically and some of the choices are quite beautiful to swim around in.  I did see one bug where a Philisaures or whatever it is called had its head inside of the rock wall. There is nice variety of species. I like that they integrated touch and I find this much more enjoyable than with the GearVR. You basically hit the triggers and propellers appear in the palms of your hand and you use your hands to swim in any direction you want. If you have front facing cameras, you can use the thumbstick to turn directions so you don't lose tracking.

One thing some people may not realize that for some of the scenes, like the Dolphins, if you hit the button, tires float from the surface and then they will attempt to float through the tires. Its a good way to quickly get them around you. Another had a fish dropping from the surface so that whales would eat the fish. 

I'm deducting one star because I do agree with another reviewer that they should do much more with the hands. It should be more interactive. Feeding, get them to move away, moving objects, etc. Even a swim mode to use your hands to swim forward for exercise rather than propellers.

Anyway, I think it is more than worth the low price, especially since it was on sale today for just a few dollars.","Dec 24, 2016 at 9:55 AM",4, 6,
