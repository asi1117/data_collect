2022-05-28 20:22:08.898290,Goatman209,awsome game,one of the best vr games ive played and it was realy cheap highly recomend,Jul 9 at 4:25 AM,5, 3,"Hey  mosesmoore209, thank you for your comment. We’re glad that you liked our game."
2022-05-28 20:22:08.913250,DarkenedXce,1$ for this game?,This game is scary and I MEAN SCARY i never write reviews but this is just so good. The gameplay is amazing for 1$. The graphics even to the the Walking dead vr graphics  on ultra and the zombies just running at you gives you a heart attack. The 2d images are the most scariest in my opinion because of how the skin is torn and bloody. I heard a Multiplayer mode is coming and im hyped for that. The overall design of the zombies are creepy like when 6 ft skeletons come after you. In conclusion this game is worth your money at 1$.,Nov 24 at 7:08 AM,5, 20,"Hey DarkenedXce!!! Thank you for your comment, It’s very nice to know that you liked the game. More interesting updates to come to the future ;)"
2022-05-28 20:22:08.929207,Crisperdad,Impressive,I didn't expect to find a hidden gem like this for this cheap.  Obviously the developers care about vr and they worked on details that makes this game truly amazing.

Quest version it is available now (with almost pc graphics) thank you for playing Mutated Virus."
2022-05-28 20:22:08.944167,DiddlyFack,IDK why but its legitimately scary,"For $1 I didnt expect much, but something about the combination of level design, character design and enemy movements had me terrified for reasons I couldnt fully understand.  I'd give it a solid 4 stars if the graphics were better. Definitely give this one a chance.","Mar 19, 2021 at 9:30 PM",3, 2,"Hey DiddlyFack,  thank you  for your comment. We're very glad that you liked the game.For Better graphics go to options and select Ultra Graphics."
2022-05-28 20:22:08.960125,kriddest,"Its very fun, gets boring","This game fits the 5 dollar price perfectly, I got it and started playing, and I was already hooked. The fear of looking behind you and a skeleton charging you with its arms out at lightning speed is scary, i'll admit, and the graphics are not that bad! But its nothing other than just playing a solo endless level, and I heard you guys are coming out with a multiplayer mode soon, and I look forward to that greatly. The shooting is good, animation is good, but there are some parts where its kind of weird. For example, a zombie might make the grunting noise from the popular game Granny, and if you pick up a weapon it might display a 2d image of the wraith, a monster from the game Evolve. It also displays 2d images of other 2d things such as different photos of a zombie. Most of the sounds dont seem original, i've played many games and hear many familiar sounds. They are just edited with a deeper sound and reverb. When I first opened the game, I was already getting chills with a little girl singing in a ghostly voice, then this heavy metal started playing, it set the mood for killing zombies very well, similar to DOOM. I set the graphics to ultra, and pressed play. What I noticed is the reloads. They are very bad and ruin the mood. Once you run out of ammo, the clip automatically floats out of the gun and a new one floats back in. I was thinking, maybe to reload/ put a new magazine in the gun, you would need the weapon to be at your waist level (Example: mags drop out of dual pistols and you put the guns to your belt to insert a new magazine) this also works with the other guns, but I think this gives that extra layer of ""intense."" If you do not put the gun to the waist level after the clip has has been dropped, it will not reload and a new clip will not go in. I think this makes it so you do actually have to reload and not rely on your magic for the reloading. If im bored and have nothing to do, i'll hop on vr and play this game. But this game has potential.","Jan 10, 2021 at 10:00 AM",4, 9,"Hey edward2002 , Thank you for your review. We're very glad that you liked the game.More interesting updates  coming soon ;)"
2022-05-28 20:22:12.077910,rodney6587,nomad,grapics are good fun to play for awhile but just anouther wave shooter,"Mar 5, 2021 at 11:07 AM",4, 4,"Hey rodney6587, It’s very nice to know that you liked the game.We are doing our best to develop the Rift And Quest version further and make it even better.

2022-05-28 20:22:12.093866,Zanzou,Good for the price but still a bit rough,"At the time of this review the game is quite cheap and a mildly amusing experience.  Definitely not something I'll spend days on end playing but something i could jump into for an hour or so every now and again.  Most of the guns are pretty bad either do to lack of ammo capacity or lack of damage, never enough ammo unless you're running dual pistols (preferably both the blue and golden variants.)  I've gotten stuck in the vines on the woodland map as well and had to spend the whole round there while zombies swarmed me.  Those are the only downsides though, aside from that it is an entertaining arcade style horde game.","Jan 1, 2021 at 7:46 PM",4, 4,"Hey Zanzou ,Thank you for your comment. We’re glad that you liked our game, in the next Update we give more ammo capacity and more damage on some Weapons ;)  a lot of interesting updates  come in the future!"
2022-05-28 20:22:12.108826,krisvdvijver,honest review,"Maybe the developer(s) are still learning, or maybe they're just having a bit of fun, or maybe a huge amount of updates are coming (in which case you could look at this game as an Early Access title), but, in any case, I currently can't recommend spending time on it for lots of reasons.  There's terrible animation for starters (zombies slide instead of walking/running and when they're running fast, it looks like a slideshow instead of a fluent animation).  Zombies all look the same, you have 3 or 4 different types. There's no AI involved, they just run towards you.  There's no animation when changing weapon.  When you shoot, you see short, white lines, sort of like shooting in Space Invaders back in '83. Sound is not 3D/positional, so you have no idea where the zombie is coming from.  Low res textures all around. Etc, etc. Should be free.","Jan 9, 2021 at 11:48 AM",1, 3,"Hello krisvdvijver, Thank you for your feedback. We’re really sorry that you didn’t like our game. We  developing at this time Multiplayer Mode! We are doing our best to develop the Rift and Quest  version further and make it even better; and there are a lot of interesting updates to come in the future. Note! When you shot the enemies they get angry and run much faster...We have 16 different types of zombies which are spawned randomly ,Maybe this is the reason happened to come up  only 4 different types of Zompies.Did you find the game very Hard? Τhe graphics in the game are much much better than trailer video!Go to options and set the Graphics Ultra. A lot of interesting updates to come in the future ;)"
