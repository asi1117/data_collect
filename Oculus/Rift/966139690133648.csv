2022-05-28 16:56:30.718560,emilito9000,Nice game about landing toy planes,A cute game about landing toy planes on an airport. I loved specially the hellicopter. Perhaps too easy but well done.,"Feb 18, 2018 at 5:43 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:56:30.734517,FastLawyer,"One of the better early games, but ...","So this was one of the better early VR games out there.  It's nice.  It'll keep you busy with so much going on.  It's really endless play.  But at the end of the day, while playing this once may feel new and refreshing  (especially if you're new to VR), it'll soon get repetitive.  It's just busy work.  Nice game to kill a few minutes though.  If you like managing a busy airport and frantic time management with some some nice VR immersion mixed in, get this on sale.","Dec 10, 2017 at 11:14 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 16:56:30.748480,ruibalp,Can it be played while sitting?,"I really liked Pilot Edition because I could play while seated at my desk.

This one says I can play while seated, but I can't reach the runway when I do.  Is there a way to bring the ground closer to your seated play space?","Dec 10, 2016 at 4:24 PM",4, 20,
2022-05-28 16:56:30.764438,Rappelle,"Needs too much space, isn't so fun","I found that although the game had fair promise, that I needed more space than I have (approx 2m x 1m). There was no way to move or scale the game, and resetting my view didn't help much at all, which is especially painful with a 2 camera set up. Probably won't get much/any play out of the game in the end :(","Dec 13, 2016 at 2:05 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 16:56:33.897058,Roly_Poly,Stellar! Best Value Game on VR platforms,"As another player stated here if buy Final Aprouch Pilot or the touch version youl get both, right now the Final aprouch Pilot version is 10.- on Wintersale and the touch version is more expensif, but if buy any or the cheapest of the 2 youl get both, make seurch you such for ""Final aprouch"" when bought to download. it not tels you in buy proces as it does with free games linked to another. 

Hapy Costumer al the way. only i do not know if saves in cloud, but on most games on the oclus platform its wise youl leurn save location and backit up , leurn this sooner or later but you have to if not want to loose save games if there is no cloud save function!

dont know about controler suport sich i hate controllers. but do know if have touch, this title you by one year or another. very smart use of the touch controllers.","Dec 22, 2016 at 6:23 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:56:33.912018,SighClops,Unique/Fun! Better than Pilot Edition,This game is a breath of fresh air amongst the FPS and throwing object games out there.. cool gameplay and the graphics look awesome. Feels like you are controlling minatures. Much better than the Pilot Edition too.,"Dec 9, 2016 at 10:43 AM",5, 8,
