I never did get round to trying the shop in this game but I found this experience a little lacklustre with only 6 jumps and limited gameplay and re-playability. 
I never got that feeling you get from being high in VR and maybe it's becuase after 2 years I now have my VR legs.
I'm sure newcomers to VR will get a really good sensation of jumping off a high slope with this experience, and if Ski-Jumping is something you've always wanted to do then give this a try but don't expect anything more.","Jun 14, 2018 at 3:12 AM",2, 13,
