2022-05-28 20:39:29.598381,GeGe_777,Outstanding experience.,I wish more businesses in general would do vr experience apps.  This app is definitely contributing towards vr going in the right direction.  Emirates has made a new customer.,Dec 4 at 1:46 PM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:39:29.613341,Cullinarn,This is what VR is for.,"Okay, so I have to start by stating that while I love The Emirates VR Experience, and while I'm giving it five stars, this is a hard one to rate, as it's hard to pinpoint exactly which category it belongs in. That said, I love it!

The environments are beautiful and to scale. The experience includes two aircraft, and there are two easy methods of going from section to section. In addition to the seating, the experience includes the lounge and spa on the A380. You can turn the lights/sound on and off, which is simply fantastic from the perspective of replicating the flight experience. There are also little things you can interact with in the environments, which is a very nice touch. All that said, there are some challenges. The movement controls are wonky, and there is no rotation. You can adjust the direction that you are viewing, but in a way that is far from intuitive and a bit dicey. In addition to this, there are a few occlusion issues. 

Challenges aside, I am grateful they decided to make this. Like many, I used to enjoy air travel. That said, these days air travel generally means getting crammed like sardines into uncomfortable revenue tubes, and being mistreated by surly cabin staff in what has become almost a form of purgatory. I think anyone who used to enjoy air travel for its own sake has, at some point, looked fondly at the luxury of the Air Emirates experience. Travelling first class on Air Emirates is on my bucket list, if I ever win the lottery, and with this experience, I feel like I've at least captured a bit of that feeling. If I had to put this into a category, I would place it with the other Relax and Meditate experiences. I enjoy simply sitting in the first class seating or the lounge as a means of relieving stress. This is, of course, basically a promotional piece for the company, but it is one that, in spite of its flaws, delivers a lot to the VR enthusiast. It rates my highest compliment: This is what VR is for.",Sep 9 at 9:37 PM,5, 20,
2022-05-28 20:39:29.629298,exileweb,"Good concept, not near release","The main UI and scenes are decent for vr, defiantly not optimised. 

No ability to change height, no controls tutorial/configuration.

To be fair, this might not be the worst VR experience I've had; but it's definitely trying to be the worst. Not worth the time installing in my opinion.",Sep 21 at 1:38 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:39:29.643261,byteframe,Pretty posh.,"I really like all these real estate/rich people experiences that show you the high life. I'm a classist and I find this extravagance objectionable, but only in real life. I really enjoy luxory porn in VR. This is pretty good. It's blurry an old unreal engine or whatever, perhaps enough to hamper the experience, but the environment is quite beautiful. Something about being rich and dubai and having nothing but tacky stuff to spend all your money on is what this app is about.",Sep 15 at 11:37 PM,5, 2,
