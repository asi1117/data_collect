2022-05-28 14:20:06.296296,jjwluijten,Brilliant!,"When I watched this VR cartoon for the first time, I felt  the same as when I watched ""One Froggy Evening"" (Michigan Frog) for the first time. This is cartoon perfection. I imagine people in the far future watching this VR cartoon during a class of art history. They'll laugh about our time, especially about the heavy and big VR devices on our heads, but they will praise this piece of art. I hope that the creators make more of this stuff.",13 days ago,5, 1,

2022-05-28 14:20:06.341175,Kungfusaber,Perfect,"I have no doubt in my mind that this game was created by god himself (Elon Musk). This game shows what every human needs in their lives. Without this game I would die with regrets. This game is the most outstanding thing I have ever seen in my entire life. 

If you are having trouble in your life, then this game will help you. Without this game I would have a seizure. This game literally cured my epilepsy. That is why I am convinced the creator of this game is god himself (Elon Musk). When you are sad, mad, and even depressed, BUTTS will eliminate those negative feelings. 

This game is better than any movie, TV show, anime, or video game that I have ever touched. If you think this game is bad, then you are a failure and I will come to your house with a sock and wack you with the sock. 

This game is a true masterpiece. If you have a different opinion than mine I will wack you with a sock. You better be scared of my sock. My sock is filled with coffee and pennies. Do you want to be hit with that? That's what I thought. 

This is a game that I could play every single day of my life and not get bored. This game is like therapy to me. If you are in need of a therapist but don't have the money, then play BUTTS. This game changed my views on life and video games in one playthrough. Can you imagine what multiple playthroughs could do?

I have decided to contact god (Elon Musk) with this review that his game is perfection.",Nov 15 at 8:33 AM,5, 182,

2022-05-28 14:20:15.849696,Nobbie248,A Masterpiece,"I have never played a game I could truly call a masterpiece, until I stumbled upon this game. Comparing this to every other game I have ever played in my entire life, this is a true life changing experience on almost godly levels. I firmly believe that this is the pinnacle of human evolution, a result of billions of years of lifeforms mutating their DNA resulting in us humans. From the first speck of dust in the universe, a whole wide array of materials and matter was created, with the sole purpose of having a sentient, biological species create this saintly game.

Throughout the lifespan of the earth, which could be estimated to be around 4.5 billion years, us humans have only been around for 200 000 years. We were the only ones who could harness almost all forms of energy on this planet, with the final goal of creating Butts: The Experience.

This will undoubtedly ascend humankind to the interstellar space age, where we will finally cement our existence to realms unimaginable today.
Being born in the age where this game exists has truly been a blessing beyond my own fragile mind. A true god would understand the capacity of goodness this is.


I truly believe that everyone that has not downloaded this game has only refrained from doing so because they don't believe they deserve such a virtuous product... No, describing this entity with a crude and unmannerly word such as ""product"" would be an insult to this prodigious and marvelous creation.

This is truly the peak of humanity.

There isn't a sliver of untapped potential within this masterpiece of a creation. The total ecstasy that you experience while processing only the surface of what the game has to offer is enough to satisfy the rest of ones life. The fissures of euphoria you will experience while playing this is otherworldly, it is undoubtedly a full body experience.

Oh why oh why must the dirty and filthy human race such as ourselves gorge in such a beautiful creation. What an outstanding world we live in.","Apr 20, 2021 at 9:02 PM",5, 240,

2022-05-28 14:20:15.879616,iiEco,Genuinely changed my life.,"The laughs, the love and the friendship in this short film were amazing.

Before this short film came into my life, I was nothing but a mere foot massager for Charli and Dixie D'Amileo; I was underpaid, overworked and exhausted.

But after I saw this, my life did a complete 180. I felt like I had taken fourteen shots of five hour energy, and been injected with medical grade black market cocaine.

I quit my day job, and followed my dream of making Fortnite edits and uploading them to punjabi movie pirating sites.

Thank you, Tyler Hurd.","Nov 12, 2020 at 9:15 AM",5, 215,

2022-05-28 14:20:19.049775,Forsey24,A phenominal masterpiece,"Upon downloading this, I had no true expectations. I lived with a cynical outlook on life with no real true hope for the future. I was barely surviving my day to day job as porn set janitor and I was about done with my life. I was, as many would call, a lost cause, a bad apple, someone with no reason to live nor anyone to help him out of the dark hole which I had dug myself into. Upon viewing the piece, I was overwhelmed with the spiritual and emotional power that it carried. I realized the true purpose of what it means to be human, to be loved.  I never thought that something so simple, so basic to human nature, could be so compelling, so moving. I understnad that this game may not have the popularity it trully deserves, but all I know is that this game has completly changed my outlook on my life for the better, and that it got me through a dark time and saved me from the depressive state that plagued my life for so long.
