2022-05-28 20:46:11.898373,Skyfall000,Great game!,"I love this game, it is a great virtual clay shooting representation with great graphics and sounds. For some reason I am not able to stop the timer for clay release and use the 'Pull' call.  Please keep on improving this game it is really good!","Dec 21, 2020 at 10:29 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:46:11.916325,MiloNelsiano,Trapshooting at last!,"Let me start by saying that I am a trapshooter. I shoot mainly American trap, and have only done skeet, bunker trap, sporting clays, etc. a handful of times. I’ve been wanting to find a trapshooting game since I’ve had a headset and finally found this game. It has a whole lot of potential and has me really excited. With two free controllers it’s very difficult, but I will be getting a gunstock to see how realistic it can be. I really like the customization options for the shotgun. I do have a few small nitpicks, such as when playing with ai, they will shoot twice at targets during American trap (only one shot is allowed unless it’s doubles). There may be other small rules that are broken by the game in the other modes, but I really don’t have much experience in those areas. I also couldn’t find a way to start on a different post. My personal preference is to start on post 4 and not on post 1, so that option would be great. The other thing I would love to see would be the option to use the microphone to call for a target (if microphone picks up sound louder than x decibels, it triggers the target). Keep up the great work, and thank you for making this game!","May 25, 2020 at 4:35 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:46:11.931285,Red_Go,Taste of joy of clay shooting,"(Review is updated after the game's 1.2 update)

I've waited a clay pigeon shooting game for a long time and it was almost the only one I could find in VR.   As a clay shooting simulation, it does what it supposed to do in a very simple way.   All environments and graphics are great (with upper 1.5 super sample), gun mechanism is pretty solid.   

This game offers no locomation (even no teleport) but that is the beauty of this game.  Just like a racing simulation (you can drive the car but can not move your body), it feels so much like a real world because there's no artificial locomotion.  

This game doesn't have multi-player mode or career mode, even no online leader board.  Now it's pretty much just a single play game.  But considering it's a really early access, I just hope to see those features in the near future.  

I have played this game about 20 hours in a week.  I've never done real clay shooting but I feel like I already tasted the joy of clay shooting with this game.

*Recommandation: VR gun stock is essential for this game.  Try American Trap first - Trap - Double Trap and Skeet.  Skeet is really hard and confusing at first but it's the best of this game.","Dec 17, 2019 at 4:12 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 20:46:11.945247,Alex_2008,Ridiculous game.,"What happens is that when I enter Its pretty good yeah, but when I start shooting clays If I fail the first one the other ones will telll me that Ive failed and they didn't yet launch any crap yet so piece of s%#t.","Dec 27, 2019 at 3:45 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:11.960207,Slandaro,Early impression(very early),"Currently the game isnt even playable as there is no setting to adjust the gun's pitch and yaw making it not line up with my shoulder at all and a shotgun you cant line up with your shoulder and no way to look down site as a result would be impossible to aim im assuming this is super early access ill rewrite my review once this is addressed because i beleive this will be a great trap/skeet game once its possible to actually aim ;)

Thank you for playing.
We will try to apply the adjustment function to the next update."
