Well i was 100% wrong and games like this prove that Vr is the future. This game is beautiful and vibrant! The different power-ups are unique and fun. The enemies are fun and colorful, you also have boss fights which i know some people love. The controls are not complicated, but the game can be for some. But you will get better with practice and you can always switch it to easy. I give this game a 5 out of 5!",Jul 15 at 11:39 PM,5, 0,

Maybe it's a close to 100% Quest port and not a real PCVR game, but you can add tons of super sampling and enjoy higher refresh rates. There's roomscale support, I had great fun using CV1 (ss 2.0) in solid 90 fps - using a GTX 1080 and i7 7700K. It's like being inside a good old arcade machine in the 1980s - and $10 is a very cheap price for this high-quality experience. Recommended for both kids and adults, but the game isn't that easy, not sure it's good for kids below the age of 10.","Jul 6, 2020 at 4:46 AM",5, 24,
