2022-05-28 18:34:14.645688,WONDERLAMB,A Shame this game is fantastic,"A shame I bought this, its unplayable. 80% of the floor is gone throughout the rest of the game after you leave the first playable area. The locomotion wont help much. Unless you love Kona so much you need yet another puzzle above all, it is possible to pass the first glitched area by teleporting out of bounds near the car crash, and locomote your way edge by edge to the shelter. Its possible to get the tools from the car too by teleporting, but meh. This game should have been fixed long ago but it hasnt.","Jul 16, 2020 at 10:34 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 18:34:14.661645,rh_galaxy,Locomotion problem,"In free locomotion after the car crash it gets all white, like others are saying. Also crazy stuttering while moving/strafing, like that is capped at a lower framerate than drawing, since you can look around without this problem showing.
In node-teleport locomotion these bugs are avoided, but instead you are up in the air too often, needs fixing.

Never seen these kind of basics going wrong in a game for $20 before. And no update since release.

I will update the review if this is fixed. Because then it deserves a four star rating, the game takes at least 6 hours to complete so there are a lot of contents.","Dec 19, 2018 at 5:40 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:34:14.676605,swanijam,Please,"Pros:
one of the best and prettiest menus i ever did see. Got me real hype for the game. That song is a jam

Cons:
The game is bugged and I ca- yeah you see the other reviews, you get it. Technically unplayable but It was pretty enough that I'm gonna wait and see if the dev fixes the bugs before I denounce it.","Sep 12, 2018 at 9:07 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:34:14.691565,Siegfriedshead,I recommend it once this bug is fixed,"I played this game before it came out for VR and it was amazing. I hate horror games and I liked this one so that says a lot. The graphics are fine actually if you go in and tinker with some settings. Turn up the preset to the desired graphics level, turn down the gamma to about 0.5. turn off vinagrette,  turn up the detail, then go into the control settings, change it to free movement and that'll give you normal movement with snap turning. The graphics look much better and not washed out after doing this.

However, this game has a serious bug right now so I'm requesting a refund until it get's fixed. It is July 12th, 2018 at the time of this review and as other reviews have stated, there's a bug where everything is just white and you can't do anything after getting out of the car near the beginning of the game.

The developer ought to not be discouraged by the few bad reviews and resolve this issue, because I believe in this game and I can see that it looks perfectly fine in VR. So long as this bug is fixed eventually, it definitely deserves 4 stars.
So, I recommend buying it if it's been a while since this review and seeing if the bug is fixed. If not, you can always request a refund anyways.","Jul 13, 2018 at 10:40 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 18:34:14.706525,Ollof,Horrible washed out graphics,"It hurts to write this, because the game itself deserves more than 2 stars. But, no kidding, this has to be the most washed out looking VR game I've ever saw. I stopped playing and started ""Red Matter"" (great lighting!) to check if my Rift is broken, but it's not, so I started KONA again and played with the gamma slider in the options. Sadly, things got only worse. No matter what settings I've tried with the slider, the game looks badly washed out and lifeless. It's very hard to feel immersed this way and I'm considering a refund because I can't enjoy KONA because of this. Another big dissapointment is the free locomotion. It's HMD oriented only, so you're always walking to where you look at. I hate it. Another thing I didn't like was the scale of my hands ingame; they're huuuge, like gorilla-huge. And I couldn't really interact with stuff and the environment, had to point with a cursor or laserpointer at things to grab or open them. I can look past these issues (minus the HMD oriented locomotion), but the washed out look of this game is killing it for me... It's a shame, because generally the visuals are nice for a indie-game, the music is great too, the story and voice acting is also good. I WANT to like KONA, it's just so aaawfull washed out looking... :(","Jun 20, 2018 at 11:48 AM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 18:34:17.838657,ScotchmanVR,BUG??,"After the crash with the car, at the beginning from the game, the person went out of the car and then... all is white. There is Displaying ""KONA"" but only white. The Hands are Trembeling more and more. I can do nothing, only exiting the game. Is This A Bug??","Jun 21, 2018 at 10:55 PM",2, 7,
