2022-05-28 15:40:48.008604,AArevalo.01,"Love this game, it so much fun!","11/20/2019
Started playing this game about two weeks ago. Game looks great, you look down at this little worrier troll character that you control.  If you have played Lucky's Tale then you will understand what this game looks like. Its a third person type game. The environments are beautiful, the game play can bring some challenges with fun puzzles and action. If you are not a patient person, this might not be for you. 

     My 7 year old likes the puzzles but does not like the action boss fights or mini battles. My older kids and I find that each boss fight just takes a little figuring out after that it becomes fun. This game is well done and lots of fun. 

Just two thing I would ask for would be:
1. The option to run a bit faster or sprint. 
2. And for the mini map to show the whole map explored per elemental area.","Nov 21, 2019 at 3:23 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:40:48.037526,AaronHeaton,The mobile roots are showing,"This would have been okay at launch with the VR gimmick but now feels antiquated. The movement is clunky and awkward (and your head affects the direction for some reason?) and combat varies between boring and frustrating. It's a Zelda clone but it lacks all of the shine and polish of a Zelda game, with ugly environments and character designs that look like Troll dolls. Puzzles are poorly designed as well, with the intended solution often unclear or majorly underwhelming.","Aug 21, 2019 at 2:38 AM",2, 1,

Somebody did suggest that I replace the ""OVRPlugin.dll"" file.  I tried that..   that does help it a little -- when I replace the OVRPlugin.dll file, it then loads up the screen in the very beginning allowing me to select a new save file.. but I do NOT see this is on the oculus screen.  I ONLY see this on the computer monitor.  However, it does NOT allow me to use any controller to get any further.  Meanwhile, it only shows the loading screen on the oculus... I NEVER see the select save file on the oculus that is displayed on the computer monitor.

2022-05-28 15:41:00.635830,KEDCOM,Simple but fun little adventure game,"An entertaining few hours of simple puzzles and monster slaying. The characters, story and the gameplay are very simplistic by today's RPG standards, but it's all well put together with nice scenery and good implementation of the player's isometric viewpoint. It really works well in VR. On scoring it, I would give the game 3.5/5 if I could, but it's a decently made early attempt at making these kind of games in VR so 4/5 it is. A fair asking price too.

I loved the 1 room at a time approach, with a camera that doesn't move about when the character moves. I would recommend this as a good game to get accustomed to VR if you are a new oculus owner and are worried about motion sickness, and getting your 'VR legs'.
Hope there's a follow up game, maybe with greater scope and more RPG elements, I'd pay for it!","Aug 21, 2017 at 3:59 AM",5, 3,

I totally agree on the Zelda feeling. If you think VR is not for platform game then try this one.
One warning though : it's difficulty makes it more suitable to grown ups.

2022-05-28 15:41:00.680711,florianlau,Good Zelda-like 7/10,"The game has a decent length (roughly 6 to 7 hours) considering it's both VR and free. The graphics are good, vibrant but not awfully detailed and the 3D effect is only really good for things and characters that come close to your fixed view position. The fighting is interesting, with just enough variety for its length and there's a good portion of puzzling (30 to 40%). The world design is quite good, but unfortunately world 3 out of 4 is much smaller than all the others, to the point of seeming rushed. Overall a good game anyone with a Rift should try out.","Aug 17, 2017 at 12:42 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:41:03.759477,curtwjen,Loved it!,I just bought my Oculus a week ago and saw this was free.  Looking back I would have been happy to have paid for it.  I've been a gamer since 1979 and I'm blessed to have been around long enough to see what I believe is the real next evolution in gaming.  Being 100% immersed is what it's all about.  I can only hope that VR truely catches on and we see this medium embraced.  Zelda VA anyone?,"Aug 20, 2017 at 9:27 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:41:03.777428,Belwin.Ec,Pleasant Surprise,"I would have easily paid 10 bucks for this little gem.  What a great game.  As someone said, the story and characters are zilch, but that's not what makes this game great.  The pin point accurate controls, the ambiance, the puzzles, hell, even the WoW-like graphics are all great.  I felt like I got teleported to this world with the fantastic implementation of 3D.  If it had dialog and a better story, I'd give it a 5.  But as it is, it's a solid 4.

The controls can be a bit frustrating at times but overall this game is lots of fun and not too frustrating. Puzzles are fairly logical. I've only encountered one boss so far and haven't beat him yet.

The mapping system is a little confusing. I keep feeling like I'm leaving rooms behind, but I'm not sure.

Overall lots of fun and proof that not everything needs to be first-person in VR. There is room for different perspectives.","Aug 5, 2017 at 3:57 PM",4, 2,

Graphics are nice, and didn't get too far in the game, as I really couldn't get ""into it"". Again for some reason It just didn't feel ""fun"". If I had to try to guess why, was that it somehow had a ""cell phone game"" type feel. All in all, give it a chance perhaps you might like it. If you like playing games on your cell phone, you might just like it on the Rift. Again, please don't compare this to Zelda.","Feb 6, 2017 at 6:57 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 15:41:29.055817,Martind64,A fun and clever game,"Overall: A great game with fun mechanics and progress. I got the game while it was free, but after having played it I would gladly have paid $10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gameplay: Right from the get go it was a lot of fun being emerged into the world - VR suites the game very well. You see your character from above and control him while killing creatures with your sword, bow and other items you obtain through out the game. You are able to upgrade your weapon and health and you're even able to buy new abilities which I found very entertaining. It's always nice being able to tell the difference between your upgraded attacks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The story: For the games purpose it's a well written story. A bit childish maybe, but I felt like it suited the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Controls: It was my first time playing a game requiring a gamepad and I was a bit hesitant about it. I quickly came to like the controls though.
(To the developers: There should be a sprint mechanic so you won't have to run at the same pace all the time or roll around.
Another thing I would like to mention about the controls is that the switching of items should not be with the arrow keys. It should be with the LT & RT.)","Jan 12, 2017 at 7:36 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:41:29.087732,Aroefel_Mao,excellent game,"I played it on a 2.5x2.5m surface. Standing, kneeling, sitting, looking behind things while I moved the little guy around.
The game is fun, relaxing, looks very good in VR (pixel override to 2), it's not frustrating and a easily approachable game.
It took me 7h to finish and makes me long for MUCH MUCH more! There is not a single thing I didn't like in this game.
More please!","Jan 3, 2017 at 1:52 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:41:32.235314,EddieNanakase,Unexpected fun adventure game !,"The game might not look appealing when you see pics of it, but it's actually pretty fun playing it. This is not an RPG game, it's an adventure game.  The fighting mechanics are pretty good. Some enemies are challenging to defeat, making it fun to play. You acquire a good number of weapons that aid you in puzzle solving and that give you options in deafeating foes and bosses. Dungeons are fun to explore with well designed puzzles that make you use a little bit of your brain power to solve. Music and sound effects are well done.  I actually enjoy listening to the characters talking, they sound fascinating !","Dec 13, 2016 at 4:42 PM",4, 0,
