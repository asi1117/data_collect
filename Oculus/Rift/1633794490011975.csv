2022-05-28 14:19:32.322296,sp33dr4ge,Top Strategy Game! Massive Potential,"Don't stop adding and expanding this game.  The game play is brilliant.  Heck I'd even invest into your studio just for this game alone because I love it that much.  Add in more commanders, skins and units!  Keep going!  My only gripe is I wish more people played so that I could find more matches vs. others.  After a while the computer becomes too easy to beat..... need another level beyond the highest.

I also think you guys could do a battleship type game for sea warfare.  Get some marketing $$ behind this and give players a reason to come back to the game each day.  Reach out to me.... I am a CMO and would love to see this thing take off.","Jan 12, 2021 at 8:37 AM",5, 10,"Wow we are blown away! Thank you for loving our game so much.

great graphics, great gameplay, just like command and conquer in vr.
Played the game for a while now and just keep going back to it .
My only request from the developers would be that we could have heal vehicles and please create more maps .
Would be nice to know what every update is doing too .
Otherwise my advise is buy it!","Nov 6, 2020 at 3:42 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:19:32.352216,Slick1984,This takes me back...,"...to when I was a little kid. Playing with little, green, plastic Army men. This is better than that, because I don't have to get them all out or put them all away.

The graphics in this game are very well done. There are three sizes in which to choose. I like to play with the pieces/maps small. I can see more of the battlefield at the same time. It's more of a ""God"" view. If you like the pieces/maps larger in scale, you have that option.

Gameplay is just like playing Army with little, green, plastic Army men and your imagination.

I do have a request of the Dev. Please include a ""Fog of War"", for maps. Being able to see what your opponent is doing, can make the game too easy. Unless you have airplanes, that remove the ""fog"" in the areas that they are currently flying over. That would greatly increase the importance of air-superiority. Each unit can expose a certain area around them due to range. Have the artillery nearly blind and need spotters. Add a ""RADAR Ping"" as something to buy. It can expose an area for 10 seconds, at a cost of $16 - $20. Those are just some ideas that could maybe be implemented? Whadaya think?

Great game either way!","Nov 18, 2020 at 6:56 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 14:19:32.383133,Batsugun21,Debra ruined this game,In order to appeal to noobs on PSVR the game developers decided to create a super undefeatable unit. Major Beaumont. The unit is stupid overpowered. I have never seen a developer do this except on cell phone games. Every player has left this game. If you want to win only play Major Beaumont unit. There is no reason to play any other unit. I tried playing the computer on hardest setting to see what counter strategy to use. The computer can’t even beat Major Beaumont. There is no counter. Don’t buy until developers decide to fix this.,"Aug 12, 2020 at 2:17 PM",1, 8,Thanks for the feedback Batsugun21.

To be honest, I searched and searched for a compatible cable to hook up my Quest the to the pc to get The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners.... but I came across Final Assault and it intrigued me....so I ended up purchasing it to try it out. I am so glad I did! It is so much fun.. I know the Walking Dead will be purchased eventually.. It won't be in the near future though, as any time I pick up my Quest..it will be to play Final Assault.

Update. 

Still worth 5 stars in my opinion. Would like to add some areas to update.

Multiplayer queue will kick you out automatically when you play campaign or solo mode enough where it felt annoying.  

I would like to see the ability added to select your own units to the slots available for each general. This would increase replay ability and open a whole new world of options. 

Please make more maps :-). 

Please make it for the Quest.

Also in other games there have been online tournaments hosted weekly or faction wars that you could join, adding something like that would increase value for the game. I would pay more for an update with some of these features added. Thank you Phaserlock team for an amazing game.","Mar 16, 2020 at 3:39 AM",5, 19,

2022-05-28 14:19:38.668036,skybird,Amazing graphics,"Just bought this game, because the reviews and what I saw on youtube looks amazing. Well, I must say, graphical its just amazing, everything look just stunning.
When I look at gameplay, I know I am new and a rookie still, but its quite hard to play this game. I play this from my chair and what i miss is, that I can not point to something to select it, like a plane in the air or a  tank on the ground. You must come really close to select something. When it is selected, you must zoom out quickly to oversee the map again and then you must make your path to the enemy or a place near. For a strategic game, this is quite difficult (thats my opinion). It should be nice, that you can overview everthing from a point and that you can select a plane from quite a distance to tell him where to go ,or a tank or whatever. Now I have to hold the plane with my trigger and I have to pull the map down at the same time to oversee everything. May be I do something wrong, I don't know, but in the tutorial it was not shown.
I love this feature in the game brass tactics area, thats why I immediately noticed this difficulty.

But still, its an amazing game and absolutely worth the money. Keep on going the good work.","Apr 5, 2020 at 7:05 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:19:38.683993,rsiggy,Great fun!,"Update - after playing this game for several more days, I'm even MORE fascinated and impressed than before.  I wish I could give it 6 stars out of 5!  The strategy elements are just so very well done.  There are several ""commanders"" to choose from and each has different strengths and weaknesses.  Game play is nearly infinite. Get this game - you will not be disappointed!
Was very much impressed with this game - graphics are way better than in the demo reel.  The game isn't nearly as ""child cartoonish"" as the demo graphic suggests. Just like Brass Tactics, which I also love, this game is different every time you play and it will take time and reps to gain proficiency.  This is definiately not a solve it once and move to the next game sort of title.  Love it!","Apr 5, 2020 at 12:00 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:19:38.730868,El_Googlies,My First Ever VR Review,"This game deserves it. I cannot believe how good this game is.  Graphics, gameplay and replay value are very high.  I feel like I'm repeating what everyone else in the comments are saying, but it's true.  I think that the controlling system could do with a bit of tweeking, especially the gripping system, but overall it is amazing.  It would be great if they create a PC version, to increase the community and have crossplay.  I would love to see a 2 vs 2 version.  This game has a lot of potential, and I cannot wait to see what they have in store for us.","Dec 21, 2019 at 4:10 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 14:19:41.821689,Hognutts,PvP Is Broken,"Updating to 5 stars...PvP has been stable for a week now. This game is awesome, and is my go to game. Hopefully the Devs keep updating and don't abandon the game.

PvP is broken...Was fine until today, close so you can continue campaign mode and you are kicked out of the queue. Leave it on the screen that shows PvP queue and it stays there with no match starting (waited an hour at one point). Up until today the wait for a PvP match was a few minutes to the point I couldn't continue campaign (a good thing).

This is an awesome game but paying money for it and not having PvP working is not acceptable. Will change my my review to 5 stars once this is fixed.","Jan 14, 2020 at 8:13 PM",5, 4,

I don't often rate games with 5 stars as it suggests little to no room for improvement but this title deserves full marks.

2022-05-28 14:19:54.479377,Raver321,One of the good ones,"I never really review games but with playing final assault i feel i must, there are quite a few positives one being the multiplayer. Usually i feel intimidated playing multiplayer due to the fact that i am not that good at them and my name and player name is always visible, but with Final Assault i love that they bring anonymity to multiplayer so that i can focus on just having fun, and not worry so much on if i suck and having to be attacked by an online bully.

I have always been a HUGE fan of Command and Conquer Games and i love that Final Assault has a kind of C&C feel to it with the different factions you can play with, i do kind of wish that the Developers would add Backstory missions. I am a big Fan of Lore and would love more backstory missions for the different characters aside from the bio under the picture. 

One thing that i would LOOOOVVVVEEEEE to see is a base building Feature, i understand that this is hard due to the Small Map sizes but if the DEVS are reading All comments that would be my suggestion BASE BUILDING would make this game Perfect.... 

one thing i will give huge credit to the DEVS for is the Great Attention to detail, on the small view the maps look like a D and D map but then when you finally find the options and go to Large view it can actually feel like your in the battle the soliders actually breath YES BREATH which i know may be a small thing but when someone cares that much about their work to put breathing and chest motions in there characters i have to give props for the non laziness good job DEVS","May 8, 2019 at 2:05 AM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 14:19:57.610641,macro101,My favorite game,"Finally, finally a real polished, fun, solid, real strategy game. Having played now over 13 hours (in about 3 sessions) I can fell confident I can leave a honest review. The game is just sooo good. So beautiful, and entertaining. I mean, there is so many different ways to play the game. 
In campaign alone you can play skirmish and a story line, or you can just play a single battle. Then there is the test mode, then there is the multiplayer mode, then there are enough different maps to keep the randomness high...

oh... and after you have done all of that, I forgot to tell you that there are different factions, so you can do all of the above again with a different battalion that behaves quite different than the one you just got used to.

I mean, one batallion may have artillery, while others have treacherous bombers. Then another have a mean, almost indestructible tank. There is one with a mean nuke.... I mean, really? That is amazing!

But all of that would still not be enough if the gameplay was lackluster or buggy. 

Well, 13 hours and nothing. Not one bug, one crazy behavior or stupid AI.

Is there room for improvement? Sure. Being able to select multiple units would be nice, a few more maps (who doesn't want more maps?), and a few more variety of units.

But that is really nit picking. I just can't stop playing this game.

Updated review.... I have had more time to play this now. My review still remains 5 stars. This game has definite replay ability. Controls are very simple to learn and take no time to figure out.  I loved the super weapon ability. Launching g a nuke at your enemy is very satisfying ng and fun to watch.

2022-05-28 14:19:57.643553,Shitposter,Fun for a while,"The mechanics of this game are pretty simple. You have lanes going from your base to the enemy base. You generate money at a constant rate. You drag units from your hand menu to either lanes (where they will move towards the enemy base automatically) or off the lanes where they will sit unless you tell them otherwise. What the game boils down to is watching what units your enemy puts on a lane, countering it, then throwing down a unit for them to counter. There are some strategy elements like placing artillery on a cliff to rain down shells on tanks in another lane, or setting up light artillery guns where they have a far line of site to the enemy base to do heavy damage, but the basics are very basic. I've played my share of the game making it worth what I paid, but I hope to see more varied units and more complex strategy in the future.","Mar 27, 2019 at 6:58 AM",4, 20,

The controls are easy to learn, and the units allow different methods of combat with different playstyles.

I've only played offline so far, but I would assume playing online would be even more fun, challenging and engaging. I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in RTS.","Apr 3, 2019 at 9:48 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 14:20:00.766851,nrosko,Early Access RTS,"Game feels quite polished already, its fun but gameplay is quite basic. Everything is well presented, asthetic is more toy soldier than historically accurate. Options are really good, menu is well thought out nice & easy to use. Gameplay is easy to get used to easier than brass tactics.  Ai on hardest are not easy to beat. I didn't try campain yet im waiting till full release before i do. You get several maps to play on. Would give 5 stars if gameplay had more depth but happy with purchase.","Mar 22, 2019 at 6:14 AM",4, 18,
