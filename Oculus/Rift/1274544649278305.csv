2022-05-28 19:21:40.131541,Aison86,Good so far...,"Good game so far, would love to see an endless mode with some kind of enemy in it. That would fix the main problems I have with the game which is that there is not enough content and you can only spend so long destroying inanimate objects.","Jul 26, 2018 at 4:51 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 19:21:40.145504,KrenGeck,Boring,"Very few levels, you will complete the game in about 25 minutes, I was just sat waiting for the game to get interesting, hell give something else to destroy than inanimate objects.","Jun 24, 2018 at 2:50 AM",1, 12,
