2022-05-28 18:44:59.067599,Gemini000,Super Chill but Short,This is a very good puzzle game to relax with to help feed those inner Tetris-related desires! Also has both bright and dark modes depending on preference. Only minor nitpick is that it's short. After just a little over 3 hours of play time I've already cleared 57 out of the 60 puzzles as of this review. Really hope to see some more added in the future! :) (Perhaps some with large quantities of smaller pieces?),"Sep 24, 2020 at 9:38 PM",5, 15,
