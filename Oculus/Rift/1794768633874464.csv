2022-05-28 17:33:48.053009,ky4ensicgirl,Suggestion for Better Play,"I enjoy this game so much!  I have a suggestion though.  How about a feature that allows you to click on a specific hole in order to pracice.  There are some that ruin my score horribly!  If there was an option either on the hand control or on the menu (there could be a map of the course).  For instance, on the hand, you could scroll through the hole numbers until you are transported to the one you need practice on or on the menu map you could click on the hole and be transported to the hole that way.  I just hate to go back to the beginning of the whole course in order to get to the one on which I need practice.  Hope you take this under consideration.  A loyal putter, ky4ensicgirl.","Jun 2, 2019 at 8:38 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 17:33:48.067969,narF_narF,Simple but limited,"My main issue: 
There's no way to reposition yourself. If you don't have enough room space, you won't be able to reach the ball.

Stuff you might want to know:
- You can play all 3 circuits in about 1h
- After that, you're only trying to improve on your own score
- No multiplayer","Jul 2, 2018 at 2:03 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:33:48.082929,roar15,,"There is no teleport.  You can’t change how close you are standing to the ball, so you can never stand over the ball like you would if you were actually playing.  You are always standing outside of the course off the “green”.  All I could do was lengthen the club so it would reach the ball.  Not fun and not close to how you would play.","May 27, 2018 at 11:20 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 17:33:48.099883,melloVR,Good Start,"It's a good start for a minigolf game, but it looks very empty. Got no background music during playing. I'm missing a floating scoreboard, instead of the one on the putter. It is pretty hard to do accurate strong shots. On close range it's very fun to play. It glitched a few times but not that bad.
The 3 courses are a good start, but I hope there's more to come. Would be great to do own courses.","Nov 9, 2017 at 12:11 AM",3, 5,"I saw the glitch in your video. (fantasy, hole3).
Sorry about that, I'm working on a fix for that right now!
Thanks for the review and the suggestions!

* glitch is fixed in version 1.01. Also long shots should be easier now."
