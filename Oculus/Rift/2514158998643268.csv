2022-05-28 20:47:23.118883,Saebri,remove the screen whiteout jumpscare,"seriously would be a 5/5 if they just remove the screen flashing to white and explosion jumpscare. i get how you want to convey the fear and emotion, but this is not the place for that. its so cheap and desperate for a reaction. you dont need ptsd for that to just be annoying and uncomfortable, we didnt download a crappy horror game.

all the environments and story are top tier, but its not good enough to recommend over the cheap jumpscare, bright white screen flash with explosion is just dumb. remove that 1 part and this will sit up there with the greatest apps like 1943 berlin blitz and anne frank house experience.","May 10, 2021 at 7:48 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 20:47:23.132846,rocknracing,Great heartfelt experience,Dont listen to the reviews of children saying this is boring and waste of time. This is a very well done documentry. It really shows you the horrible situation some people are in through out the world. It always shows you how fortunate you are. If at the end of this you have no feelings or feel hearbreak for this family you are not human. This is not a game so kids just avoid it. If you want an eye opener about life please give this a chance!,"Oct 19, 2020 at 7:55 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:47:23.147806,grundle98,A great service to the Iraqi people,"While you often see footage of the war in Iraq, you much less so see the impact it has on the ordinary people living in the country. This free experience allows you to enter the home of a family in Fallujah so affected by war that it moves you to tears. You can literally sit down and observe this family having a meal and imagine yourself in their position, and imagine your family as their family, having to live through this horrible situation of rockets hitting the house and IEDs littering the neighourhood. Staring into the face of an Iraqi father as he tells you how the war with ISIS affected his family did far more to bring the reality of the situation of Iraq to light than any news report or article.","Sep 16, 2020 at 10:15 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:47:23.162766,dreamxdrummer035,Very Well Made,"It can be hard to watch and listen to as the story is of the loss of a man's two children and the destruction of their home after the war. But it is very educational and worth the experience. For those with PTSD, It is best not to watch as a previous reviewer stated.","Aug 28, 2020 at 6:14 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:47:23.179720,nightcat.mau,That WARNING Needs To Be On Top,"If you have PTSD, skip this one. Seriously, that warning should be on top and in the game itself. Repeatedly. Most people don't read an app's full description, but I can't stress enough that this crosses a line. This is not OK.","Aug 28, 2020 at 2:07 AM",1, 17,
