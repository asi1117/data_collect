Definitely not for the faint hearted, this game will test your skills as a gamer but you will be rewarded with some serious satisfaction when you crack those tough levels.

Graphics look great and with 96 levels this is a meaty game that will outlast most other VR titles that have only taken me a couple of hours to complete.

See you on the leaderboards 😁","May 22, 2020 at 6:40 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:40:25.611995,JSY911,Are you after a real challenge in VR?,"I grew up gaming in the 90's where games were fun, hard and challenging. They made you want to keep going back to it until you beat the game completely. Which was very rewarding! This game reminds me of those games but taking it to a whole new level in VR with 6-DOF! 

It is fun, hard and challenging! With 96 levels to try and beat, this is going to take a while - and I am looking forward to the challenge! 
Certainly not to be missed, click that buy button and get ready to play a great VR game.","May 20, 2020 at 6:54 PM",5, 4,
