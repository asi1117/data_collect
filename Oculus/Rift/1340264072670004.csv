2022-05-28 16:40:59.785958,ProfoundBeggar,Great Little Game,"There's not too much to say: it's kite flying, with some minigames to add variety. 

You have 3 different kites with different performance and different unlockable skins for each, 3 different locations, and a couple of built in minigames. The locations are simple, but each has their own quirks that makes it fun and different.

There are two ""minigames"", as it were: one is Snake, where you have to collect floating stars in the sky, with a streamer tail getting longer every time you do; if you crash or ""cut"" your own tail, it's game over. The second is Outlast, which has RC planes chasing your kite, and you have to survive as long as you can, while trying to force the pursuing planes to either crash or knocking them out of the sky by hitting them from behind.

All in all, it's not a *deep* game, but it is a fun little time waster. I got it on sale for a buck, and at that price it is without a doubt a great deal. Having played it, even if it were only available at its MSRP of $5, I'd still tell my friends to get it.

I only gave it 4 stars because I would like for it to have a little more content (more kites or locations wouldn't go amiss, nor would other modes), but it's still a solid experience and wanting more doesn't mean the game isn't already fun.

If you want a semi-casual game that's easy to just pick up and play, this is a great option, and I'm glad to have gotten it (especially at its sale price).","May 23, 2020 at 9:19 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:40:59.800918,GrahamFord,Brings You Back To Childhood,"A fantastic experience that draws you back to great memories. Flying a kite has always been a fun, simple (once you learn), relaxing action to do. Its a natural thing, like throwing a frisbee. I've also been looking into learning kiteboarding and this does a great job of helping your mind wrap around that type of physics based mechanic. You don't necessarily need to understand the wind, just be able to feel it...and you can nearly feel the wind in this game. The reason I think great games like this go undiscovered or unplayed for a while is that they aren't spread by word of mouth for the purpose of playing via multiplayer. Would love to fly a kite alongside a friend or battle against them like the plane mini-game.","Mar 17, 2020 at 7:12 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 16:40:59.815878,Georgio,Lovely relaxing experience.,"Back in the 70's a chap called Peter Powell invented the stunt kite and I bought one. Many hours were spent flying that kite and I have some great memories of hot summer days doing nothing more than flying a stunt kite.
This is a great little program, bag it while it's cheap!","Nov 30, 2019 at 5:58 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:40:59.830838,Chrono52,all i get is beach flying a kite,how am i supposed to enjoy this when i only get flying a kite on the beach nothing no other options when game loads up just beach thats it,"Dec 13, 2019 at 3:50 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 16:40:59.845798,RScullion,Surprisingly good fun,"I really didn't expect to enjoy this much. I thought the beach might be a nice simulation, however it's actually pretty good fun. Flying the kite on its own gets boring pretty quickly but the 'snake' and chase modes soon liven things up. I like the mountain and the beach scenes. The city one is pretty poorly done and lets the whole thing down.","Apr 25, 2019 at 4:52 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:41:02.980414,evilStimpVR,Quite realistic and addictive,"I initially thought there wasn't going to be much more to this than just flying a kite, but the competitive game modes are actually quite addictive and keep you coming back for just one more go as you try to climb the leaderboard.

I regularly use power kites when the weather is good and so I was pleased to see that this provides realistic physics and feedback for the VR experience when the weather outside just won't let me do it in real life.

With the music turned off, the beach scene is actually a perfect escape and after a few minutes you start believing you really are on a beach. Use a fan to blow gently on you to increase the immersion. Definitely one to pick up and it's priced well.","Mar 8, 2019 at 12:12 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:41:02.996371,mdrejhon,A nice relaxing visit to the beach too!,"Even if you didn't buy this game for the kite, the ability to stand at a calm beach with the palm trees and flying birds and the ocean -- is worth the price alone.  Even if you're not flying the kite. This is an inexpensive indie game, buy it to support this studio! Even if you never play it except to view a virtual beach.

Now about the kite -- that was a pleasant surprise how much fun I had flying it.  The kite flight is realistic like the real thing! And you get multiple kites, and locales, too. So you get more than your money's worth. And it's the right kind of game to calm my nerves after a long workday before bedtime (unlike the horror games & andrenaline games which are fun too, but um, can keep me awake).  

With the ""easy kites"", it is also an excellent ""simple"" beginner VR game too for those ""Oh no, 3D movies give me a headache"" people. They are pleasantly surprised that VR doesn't give them headaches (at least in this game).  And not much training -- you just tell them how to grab the kite strings and then they'll fly it just the real kite they've flown before.  It's that realistic.

Optionally, with the advanced kites plus a NOKIA-style ""SNAKE"" mode (where you fly the kite towards stars to lengthen a kite trailer), there are some fun arcade gamifications of kite flying too. Clever and fun!  

Or just play in realistic mode with no HUDs or gamifications -- just pure zen.  
(One welcome difference from real world though: Easy relaunch of the kite on first try simply by yanking the kite string on crashed kite)

In addition to being a game I can play to give me an instant vacation to the beach -- Perfect game before bedtime too if you need to a bit of zen calm.   And it exercises your arms, which is healthy, isn't it?  Now go fly a kite!","Mar 2, 2019 at 5:09 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:41:03.033272,TwistedErotica,Surprisingly Realistic!,"If you have flown stunt kites before, you will appreciate how well they have captured the realism. The maneuvering is very tight. :D","Mar 3, 2019 at 6:43 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:41:03.049230,DonWe,Feels great!,"I was surprised how accurate the simulation is, although last time I actually did it in real life is long ago. But it just feels right to me. Great use of vibration and sound as feedback. Three surroundings (mountains, city, beach) and different kites to try out.","Oct 2, 2018 at 11:20 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:41:06.136971,adam.ornelles,More like kite master,"Feels cool. But as someone who has flown kites for awhile it's fairly underwhelming. The kites feel desensitized and slow, and most of all I'm dissapointed you can't stall the kite to do any tricks. Can't really call it STUNT kite master if you can't do stunts.","Jul 30, 2018 at 10:41 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 16:41:06.150934,Renemouse,Relaxing,"Having apparently only played this for 8 minutes, which felt longer, I'm already confident in saying that this is a hidden gem. There's little to do or see. Not many game modes. Not a hufe amount to unlock. You just stand in one place and fly a kite. There are a few kites and scenes avaialble, and a couple of gamemodes, but mostly it's kiteflying. And it's fun! You perhaps, like me, won't spend hours in this. But it's an experience you can only have in VR (or the real world, I suppose), and it just works. Recommended.","Jan 19, 2018 at 10:53 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:41:06.165894,lad3d,Plesantly Suprised,"As an experienced kiter, I was a little dubious about this app, but the sale price broke my resistance. 
The scenes are much, much nicer and more realistic than the video previews suggest. The physics are pretty accurate (except I wish it was this easy to re-launch a kite in real life!). :)
The biggest discovery was the haptics. Kiting has the characteristic ""tug"" and I assumed that the hand controllers would, at most, deliver the typical, annoying ""pager"" vibrations. But, unlike any other Touch compatible program I have, the vibrations were quite subtle and appropriate.","Jan 15, 2018 at 8:03 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:41:06.180854,10JQKA,Great Idea,"What an ingenious idea for a VR game, I enjoyed it way more than I expected. You really get the feel that you are flying a kite and the mini games are a fun way to kill some time and relax. Also it is nice to see a realistic pricetag for once, I got it on sale but even the full price is hardly going to break the bank.

Well done to you guys, hope you keep working on this as it is such a great project.","Jan 22, 2018 at 12:44 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:41:06.195814,C1V1LWAR,Pretty darn good,"First off the kite handles well and that's very important as it's the main mechanic here driving this seemingly casual stunt kiting game. It's compact with 3 game modes played against a few different backgrounds. A free flying mode (gets dulls fast), a collect the stars score attack mode (addictive), the last a more difficult airplane attack mode where toy planes close in and need to be hit from behind to be destroyed. And therein lies the rub, it's really tough. They need to tone down the difficulty, pad out the levels as precision handling is demanded almost immediately which is off putting. Still it's good, cheap and fun to play.","Dec 14, 2017 at 5:42 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 16:41:09.305496,FastLawyer,Hidden gem,"This is a very relaxing, chill VR game.  And it's also a lot of fun.  You can just fly your kite around.  Or try to go for first place on the leaderboards in one of two different game modes.  One of them you are just collecting stars as quickly as possible to get a high as score as possible.  In the other mode, you are avoiding toy RC type aircrafts that fly a lot faster than you.  Both modes are a lot of fun even if you're failing bad.  There are three different locations: beach, city, and snow mountains.  I loved the beach and snow mountains environments.  There's also different kites to unlock.  Nice family fun and a great deal on sale for $3.","Jan 13, 2018 at 2:56 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:41:09.319459,TheLad,Great Physics,"Having flown 2 line kites before the physics of this are so realistic.  Great game, have spent lots of time relaxing flying kites in VR when the weather outside isn't up to it!  If you are having tough time controlling stick with it, it will click after a while!  Hoping they might add a 4 line kite in future update if that would work with touch controllers :)","Jun 19, 2017 at 12:59 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:41:09.334420,Holmesboy,"Fun little game, developers are helpful.","Update: They have been in constant contact and very helpful. The problem is having other controllers attached, and they are going to patch this in the future. Fun game, very relaxing and a great demo for new VR players.","Mar 23, 2017 at 2:07 AM",4, 1,
