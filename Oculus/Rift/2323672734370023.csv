2022-05-28 19:41:05.809431,Kai11011101,Loved it! Beautiful. Like a dream,So much atmosphere! I loved the lighting and the color and the characters. It's like a dream. Perfectly spooky and moody just the way I like. I wish the dev made more.,"Jul 26, 2020 at 10:45 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:41:05.823394,OctopusGarden,Not Very Scary,"I thought that there would be at least some scares in the Haunted Graveyard, but there weren't any thing that was the least frightening.   It was very short.   And althought the experience was somewhat decent, I have a hard time giving it any thing better than three stars because there was no story line and very little evolvement other than interaction with a four characters and nothing really spooky at all.   Someone referred to it as Disney like.   Yeap, that's about my take on it.","Jun 29, 2020 at 1:57 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:41:05.841346,Yadissac,,"I am having trouble with this game. I have installed it twice but I am still not getting any sound from it. I have tried other games and do not have that problem. Thoughts?

I put 1 star because I have had this comment up for a while and no one from the company has said anything.","Sep 20, 2019 at 1:44 PM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 19:41:05.856307,McNabb,Hoping for more,"This is the kind of thing I'd like to se emore of on the platform. A fun, moody, atmospheric, not too scary (except the well - watch out for the well!) adventure in the vein of the Haunted Mansion, with great visuals and even great voice acting - the whole thing is worth it for the ferryman's song alone. I'm hoping that there are more experiences like this in the future, and I'd be very happy with an expansion to this, as the experience overall is pretty short. Definitely worth the price.","May 12, 2019 at 10:50 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:41:05.870269,DisplayVRC,Very good,"Its more like a dark fairytale with a hidden message.
I enjoyed it so much that i was sad when i reached the end.
I could play this all day but the story wasnt long enough for that :(
Worth the money? Hell yes!","Apr 16, 2019 at 2:55 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:41:08.969601,Broyden,A nice little ride,"Super fun and very enjoyable (locomotion was a tad annoying at first).  Big fan of the Ferryman, my only regret is that the experience wasn't longer.","Feb 12, 2019 at 1:05 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:41:08.983564,flbldirish,Very Enjoyable Experience,This is a very well produced not so scary horror experience. When it comes to VR Horror most apps and games go over the top with jump scares. This reminds me alot of Disneys Haunted Mansion Ride and I really enjoyed it.,"Jan 17, 2019 at 4:39 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:41:08.998524,ccamachog,Highly recommended,"I really enjoyed this experience. It is like a horror passage and it is not very long (25-30 min), but it is very immersive and has a great quality.","Jan 6, 2019 at 4:01 PM",5, 10,
