2022-05-28 14:43:56.608759,Marcan37,Really Buggy grass effect in first stage,"Fantastic and very addictive game ... for sure but ...

This game is awesome, it was one of my favorites. If only it would work well with my Ryzen 3700x on Link mode Quest 2 but no it's not at all optimised, even a bit, for Ryzen according to what I see. 

I know , games are really slow to begin using max available cores but some do really well in 2020 to handle it. Not this one. I have a pretty beefy Ryzen 3700x at 4.4 peeks , clocked at 4.2 without boost ....  with 1080 GTX superclocked model ... 32 gb of RAM ... and it is only using 9% of my CPU while stuttering a lot . Whathever the way I try to use it.... I get horrible stutters all along the rides with Quest 2 link mode. .... and yes , my link works good for other quick action games. For the same same configuration with my I7 6700k , I was like .... really impressed with the fluidity but now .... it becomes pretty tough to play this game on 3700x Ryzen .  Disabling SMT didn't help ... I don't find a way to force on only 4 cores and that it uses them correctly. I'm stucked with the headset version for the moment but I'd very like to use it on the PC version as with my old 6700k from intel. 

Pretty disapointing for Ryzen users but really really good game for Intel users. I'm an IT  , my installations are very well made and I test with apps like Process Lasso . Not good results. Somethings in the code of this game is making it really really bad on my Ryzen . Well , hope it'll be enhanced a bit. It's stuttering a lot. Sometimes during the game , my most working Core is at 1000 mhz . I seen way better usage of my Ryzen even if I understand 16 cores are not typically the best for gaming. At 4.2 ghz , I'd hope better results instead with using SMT OFF or other way. 

If a EVGA 1080 GTX Superclocked is my bottleneck ... I'd be surprised cause it was not before. The first stage is tragic on stutter. I can't remove the grass , it's still there when we click OFF.

I'd really want this game to run smooth","Nov 18, 2020 at 11:57 AM",3, 6,

If there were more stars, you'd get them! 
========================================
If you like flight games for the freedom of swooping around, you need this one. This is crazy fun! I commonly play it until my arms want to fall off. (Yes, I know there are other controls, that's not the point.) 
I can't speak to the level of realism in the flight mechanics, I would guess they're arcaded up to make it more fun, but the level of realism in the graphics is pretty decent for a VR gaming experience. The tracks are cool. The AI gets progressively harder. Haven't played multiplayer yet, I'm still having too much fun solo.

My Thoughts:
This was such a thrill to play, the sense of speed, height and adrenaline is amazing in VR and the closest you'll get to the REAL thing. Gameplay reminded me of the classic PlayStation snowboarding game 'SSX TRICKY' which cannot be a bad thing.","Sep 4, 2019 at 11:55 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 14:43:59.825758,MAJ161.RED,Same account crossplay? Hands-free?,"This is a great game. It's a favourite with all my family. I have it on the Oculus Go, the Rift and now the Quest. Now for a couple of requests for the developers.

Request 1
You proudly offer crossplay.  but I can't play with my grandchildren (even though I have the game three times on three headsets) because my headsets are all on one Oculus account - I can't add myself as a friend.
Please, please, please let us crossplay together. The game Slightly Heroes lets us play with a Go versus a Rift by using a code. Please check that game out to see that it can be done.  My grandson, Teddie, really loves this game. It would be amazing if I could race him (and his dad) to the bottom of the mountain.

Request 2
I work with elderly and disabled people who sometimes have little or no movement in their hands. However, they can move their heads.  They can play this game by moving their head once I get them past the menus and they are standing on the mountain top. They can gaze to start and fly to the bottom of the mountain. They can't boost, but they still love the freedom of flight.
Can you please have a hands-free option and make the menus operable by hands-free gaze control too? Then they could control the game themselves. That would be very empowering for a person with limited mobility. The menus would be easy to make hands-free. I'm not sure about boost - perhaps a head flick or something or automatic boost areas. I'm sure you can work something out.
Great game. Please make it accessible for everyone.","Jun 24, 2019 at 2:58 AM",5, 12,

Obviously everything is better on the Rift, the visuals , the controls, the feeling flying through the air.  You can jump in and play this game for 5 minutes or hours.  
I'd recommend this as a good staple game, I'd like to see a few more things.  Custom mapping, and a leaderboard showing scores v.s. friends would be nice.","Jun 15, 2019 at 1:17 PM",4, 3,

Only major thing they could improve is the terrain, especially because you are supposed to fly so close to it to get boost.

2022-05-28 14:44:02.975501,Gecko-VR,Exhilarating and an experience!,"I was happy to purchase this game on sale as it is definitely worth the play time. The feeling of gliding through the air and flying right past trees and into canyons is amazing. You have the option to hold your arms out like you're actually flying or use your head or controllers in case your arms get tired (which they will). I haven't been able to get into any lobbies with other players online yet; but that's not really the developers fault.

The only downside about this is that the AI can get pretty difficult even on the second map out of four.

Overall great game, could be a little bit more polshed for me to want to call this an ""essential"" but it's totally worth the buy.

2022-05-28 14:44:03.006419,mdrejhon,Closest to Wingsuit BASE I'll ever get,"Although I don't BASE jump, I'm a licensed skydiver (Canada, via CSPA).  So I'm commenting this from an actual skydiver perspective.

Lots of fun even if ""arcade"" implementation of wingsuiting, becomes even more fun when you make 2nd track and beyond.

Albiet ""arcade"", certain elements of real-world wingsuit/skydiving culture here - end-of-day bonfire camaderie too. Wingsuits look realistic. ""Jump Plane Main Menu"" is neat, even if glorified/bigger than real-world. Really nice inspirations with the RUSH ""sponsor"" (spoof of existing real-world BASE sponsors GoFast or RedBull), the real skydiving-helmet-feel. 

One control method is arm control that simulates real-world wingsuit steering in a simplified/arcade way. Game has much more generous steering and glideslope capability -- which allows you to ask whuffo friends, ""Hey, wanna try it?"" to your family members -- that's the important part.  Just hard enough but easy enough.

You may have seen all the YouTube of wingsuit BASE?  Wanna at least try a fascimile (even if arcade-ified/simplified) -- go buy this game!

Graphics are average but game (speed-wise) replicates the groundrush effect to a real-world Wingsuit BASE jump (speeds look approximately accurate) and you can dive/flare/steer your wingsuit. 

Motion comfort level is surprisngly good for fast-motion flight game. (That said, parachute landing at the ending is fast & flare-less - adding a ""flare"" easter egg would make landing more realistic!)

If only I could feel wind (over 100mph of it!) in my hands, but this is the closest immersion you will ever get standing in VR.

Definitely highly recommended if you are interested in wingsuiting, at least from a casual/whuffo perspective, and to share with other friends/family members that aren't freaked out.

In the most realistic mode, your arms will eventually get tired (if you use that instead of thumbstick/look control), but not nearly as tired as during real-world wingsuiting. 

Still good exercise during winter!","Mar 1, 2019 at 5:29 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 14:44:03.022375,PhotoDeej,"""Honey, take a good picture!"" I'm dead","Rush is an absolute BLAST! The controls are intuitive and very engaging. The ability to smash into a tree, and then just teleport back to the top of the course is AWESOME! 

The only critique I feel should be voiced, is the way the head-wind mechanic works.
I think I figured it out at this point, but when I was starting out, I was thoroughly confused! You'd be having an excellent run, and get to a point where your speed slowly starts to degrade, until you're falling to your immenent death for seemingly no reason. I believe this mechanic should be improved by having the user interface explain the slowdown during the tutorial.

Otherwise, this is now one of my favorite games! It has SO many courses to run, the value and replayability are second-to-none.

I highly recommend RUSH!","Mar 11, 2019 at 3:15 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:44:06.196520,__Mortal__,Nerf gun > wing suit,"Honestly, This game feels very unpolished for $20. The flight controls are a little twitchy at times, and other moments unresponsive. I played for almost an hour and had the most fun shooting the overpowered Nerf gun at the various other moveable items in the game. Maybe an update will allow for taking the Nerf gun with us on the jumps? Maybe shooting opponents will slow them down? Also, some of the voice work...must she say bizarre things? No one speaks like that IRL. 

Also, this game needs swords, laser swords, and better music, and maybe colored blocks flying towards me at high speed.

Seriously though, I think Rush has good potential. I'd like to see a little more feedback between arm motion and virtual body motion. Maybe haptic feedback with varying degrees of intensity (stronger the farther away from neutral position)?

One last thing: Why are there so many paddles on board the airplane!!??","Dec 11, 2018 at 12:11 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 14:44:06.212477,Falcon_DS_,You just gotta have one more go...,"This is currently one of my favourite games.  Better than Mount Wingsuit, with a great feel and perfect controls.  It just keeps you coming back for more day after day and has that 'Just one more go' factor when it's time you really should be doing something else (e.g when the wife calls 'Dinner's ready!').  I just wish you could do a controlled spot landing at the end; say on a target, or maybe several different targets with different difficulty and higher rewards.  Glad it is single player as well as multi-player, although the AI seem to cheat; getting boost without flying low or close to obstacles and there boost seems to last much longer than yours, even when you've achieved max boost.

My legs hurt and I play it seated hehe. Arms hurt but it's a good hurt. Anyone who love flightsims or Superman will have a hoot with this. Can't tell you what performance is on lessor cards, but on my 1080ti literally all maxed setting and runs perfect in the 2 hrs I've played so far. I don't see or hear others in voice chat so I don't know if it's implemented yet??

Update. 
I have opened up about half the runs. The term ""grind' having been used, I thought I would mention it is no more a grind than running laps in my favorite race sim to improve my times and lines. I did think, with so many different runs it might start to get a little duplicative, but  I am finding some neat diversity in many runs as I progess.  My only complaint is my other games are suffering neglect right now, as I just can seem to stop playing this.","Aug 29, 2018 at 8:22 AM",5, 25,

I only give it 4 stars because sometimes the computer controlled racers have unlimited boost. Meanwhile you have to hover close to the ground to get boosts. Sometimes the hovering doesn't even register. I was not expecting perfection but the unlimited boost by the npcs was--- challenging.

2022-05-28 14:44:12.451636,ccdeltabeta,"Great Single Player, Not-So-Great Multi","Single Player is an absolute blast.  Although there are 4 levels, the variations you can cover on each level (around 18) brings a lot of life to this game, and I commend the developers for this apporach.
The multi-player, however, has been less than thrilling for myself.  I'm currently through 75% of all the tracks, and only 3 times out of 15-20 attempts have I found somebody live to race against.  2 of those 3 were with kids that sounded young enough to me to ask 'is your head big enough to wear the display?'; the third time was with folks that had no interest in talking.
Now the single player is great, and you can have a real fun playing it, but at times it felt lonely, and not being able to find live folks to race against on a regular basis gets to be more depressing the longer I play this game.  To be fair, I generally don't get to play until most of the family is in bed (11pm), or early in the morning (before they get up), so my timing may just stink compared to the rest of the world,but my expeience is my experience.
The control options they give you is astounding, and I was ashamed to find out using my arms as gliders got me feeling tired after 4-5 races (yes, I could be in better shape). Not dead tired, just fatigued enough to feel ashamed. My default control scheme is the rotation of the controller (arms at my side, elbows bent 90 degrees).
The gameplay is simple and fun.  Not much to it, which makes it extremely easy to pick up and play a few races.
I gave 3 stars because even though the single player is a blast, that with no multiplayer that accomodates my schedule, it eventually start to feel like a grind, which over time starts to feel depressing at times when I start playing.","Sep 8, 2018 at 11:06 PM",3, 4,

 love the idea of free falling and flying around.  However the only time you unlock any courses is when you get third place or better in a race.  But now I've hit a grind wall cause no matter what I do I come in 5th.  So I'm effectively locked out of 75% of the game.  Wingsuiting is about feeling free while your in the air, now I have to play every track I have unlocked as close to the ground as possible just to build up turbo.  The multiplayer is dead.  I left find a game on for an hour multiple times the past week, not even able to join not one multiplayer game.  

So developers, I hope you see this review, I'm recommending a few fixes:
1. if you complete a course, no matter what place, the next one should open up.
2. all 4 areas should be open from the start.
3. the AI difficulty should be toned down so you don't have to live on turbo just to make it to third place.
4. do a free weekend every month, you guys need some multiplayer races, i thought it would be fun to race people, not dead.

I love the flying, you got the flying and the motion sickness problems other games have down pat.  I commend you for that.  Just fix the other stuff I mentioned.","Jun 24, 2018 at 2:09 PM",3, 22,"Hi Scorpion - thanks for your feedback - much appreciated! We were actually planning to introduce a minimum of a point per race reward in the next patch, that way so long as you finish you'll make progress. Its always difficult to balance challenge and reward for all play types but we think this will bring it closer.

As for multiplayer, indeed Rush has only been very recently released on Rift so it's still building an online community. We're looking into cross-play options with Go and will definitely look into some free weekend events. 

Also, we are planning an Adventure mode in a future patch where you'll be free to roam the mountains and track down hidden objects at your own pace - this sounds like more of what you're looking for :)

We'll be supporting Rush for a long time to come so we greatly appreciate your feedback so we can continue making Rush the best VR experience possible. Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 14:44:15.596328,Vetkin,Shallow Gear VR game,"I bought this as part of a summer sale bundle, but would have never spent money on it otherwise. It's a port of a Gear VR game and it feels like it was developed for a mobile platform.  The graphics are pretty mediocre, even when maxed out, and the sensation of speed isn't there.  The gameplay itself, flying through rings, feels shallow, and with a bland environment there just isn't much excitement to be had. 

Being able to use the touch controllers to steer in this version is nice, but your arms will quickly tire after holding them out in front of you for a few rounds.  In a real wingsuit you would have air restistance helping to prop them up.  There is the option to steer with your head, which is the less realistic but more comfortable option. 

Honestly I can't see myself ever having a desire to play this again after my first session. There are a number of wingsuits to unlock, so that may motiviate others to stick with it.  If I had children who needed something simple to play in VR it might keep them occupied, but I've got more entertaining games to spend my limited time on.

Edit: Thanks for the developer response. I did try out the boost system and got a good feel for how it worked. I by no means mastered it in my limited play time, so if I enjoyed the gameplay more I could see myself puting in more hours improving my times.  I will have to try out the update.

Maybe if the flying felt less 'floaty' and a bit faster paced, and the environment was a bit more detailed for the Rift, I'd be more distracted from the fact that I'm just coasting through rings. I've never tried a real wingsuit, however, so maybe it's accurate.

Hopefully nobody takes from my review that I was critical of the game for a lack of real wind resistance.  I was just relating that while being able to use touch controllers is a nice addition, my arms quickly got tired. So it's a toss up between realism and comfort with the head steering option. The game provides the option so that's a plus.","Jun 23, 2018 at 11:42 AM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 14:44:15.613282,TheNopePope,,"Question: Is there anywhere explicitly talking about how to optimize speeds? The game teaches you how to control the wingsuit, but not how to race it. There's no visible method to outspeed NPCs.

Review:
I really wanted this to be a 5 Star game. Skydiving sounds like an amazing VR concept. In the end, it lacked any of the thrill I hoped for. Low thrill and simple/repeating gameplay. 4 Stars is generous, but it's new and unique for VR, and that deserves a lot of credit.","Jul 2, 2018 at 10:31 AM",4, 4,"Hi TheNopePope - thanks for your feedback. We are looking at ways to further communicate the 'grind' mechanic - that is, the lower and riskier you fly, the more boost and speed you will obtain. This is the key to victory and also the most exhilarating way to play the game. We will continue to work on this communication moving forward and hope this helps you for now :) Thanks again!"
2022-05-28 14:44:15.629240,SwirlyMaple,If it seems boring give it a few races..,"My first impression after going through the tutorial and first few races was that it was a disappointment. Felt slow, unexciting, and anticlimactic.

BUT, the appeal of this game really comes on in a BIG way after you get through some of the beginning races and unlock the other courses. If it seems boring after your first five or six races, you're flying too lazy. The game rewards you with increased speed and boost by flying closer to the ground and obstacles, which has a twofold effect: 1) you're obviously going faster because of the boost and 2) flying really close to things gives a much greater sense of speed as the ground rushes beneath you.

The snowy mountain and misty mountain levels are just wonderful, and when you get to the later stages in them it is exciting and exhilirating to skim as close as you can to the terrain while you try to outpace the other racers. The weather in the game is also great, and gives some interesting diversity and extra challenge to the courses.

Overall, I really enjoy this game. It's great for jumping into and blasting through a couple quick courses without having to commit to hours of play time. I've also enjoyed bringing my friends in with multiplayer and racing with them. The haptic rumble recently added is a nice touch to let you feel ground turbulence and speed too!

Suggestions for the devs: 1) The mic audio didn't seem to work in multiplayer. We got around this by using the Oculus party chat, but it'd be nice if it worked in-game natively. 2) Can you please change the race finishes so we have the option to fly our parachute all the way to the camp and land? Maybe it's just me, but I really enjoy the final descent with the chute and it's disappointing when the game fades out before I've had a chance to do a proper chute landing. Thanks, and also thanks for a great experience!","Jun 20, 2018 at 3:09 PM",5, 11,"Hi SwirlyMaple - thanks for the great feedback! To answer your questions, yes voice over IP for people outside of Oculus parties is coming in the next patch. And yes, while we have extended the parashooting times before, we agree that it can still cut short on some of the levels so we'll be sure to extend that for the next update also. Thanks again for the feedback :)"
2022-05-28 14:44:15.645703,friedgoldmole,Play this to feel like your flying!,"I have only unlocked the second mountain so far but this is without doubt the best feeling of flying I have had in VR to date. Once you get used to the controls you'll find youself skimming closer and closer to the ground to get those boost refills; the feeling of adreneline as you just clip the tips of the grass as the grounds falls away over a cliff is awesome. 

The screenshots/videos don't do the game justice, obviously this was originally a GearVR port which initially made me unsure of its quality, but in motion it looks really good, especially with the settings cranked up. I think this is going to be one of my favourite VR experiences for some time, its easy to pick up and play, but leaves you wanting to have just one more go. My arms did start to ache after a short time, but the game is so fun I forgot about that pretty quickly and I was playing for over an hour.","May 13, 2018 at 6:24 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 14:44:15.661660,Slick1984,"Moderate at first, then comfortable.","I just bought RUSH during the Daily Deal and these are my first thoughts. The game looks great, not realistic, but not too cartoony. There are arrows in the game that show the path to be taken. However, you'll not score well if the path is followed. I made some close passes to trees and rocks (accidentally) and was awarded a boost, so it rewards risk taking. I didn't really get a sense of flying, but I did get a sense of moving and that caused me to lose my balance a couple of times, so play with knees bent. You can play with your arms out or with your elbows locked to your side. The elbow lock way I found to be more of an extreme steering. I was able to make sharper turns, but at the price of motion sickness. Fortunately, it was short lived but lingering. The worst went away, but I was still a little off. I had to take a break after three or four races. I would guess that my motion sickness trigger is in the middle. So, those of you who are touchy may want to avoid. For me, it was a different kind of experience. I like having variety in my VR library and this makes it that much more diverse. I did ok in my first few races and with some practice, I might ""GIT GUD"". One star off for queazyness and I DID adjust the comfort slider bar in the options. ///UPDATE/// The motion sickness has improved! I am fully enjoying this game.  Adjusting my title and rating.///UPDATE///The more and more I play this game, the more and more I like it. There are 20 tracks per mountain (only have 2 mountains unlocked, out of 4). The tracks vary slightly from the other tracks on the same mountain. But each mountain gets harder, more extreme. I am getting better at it, but the AI players are getting harder to beat. Minimal movements to play. It can be played sitting down, if you wish. There aren't many people available for the multi-player races. So, buy it and race others. It's fun and doesn't take much to learn.///UPDATE/// Bug found. I placed 2nd but 3rd place was faster?","Jun 19, 2018 at 2:39 AM",5, 12,Hi Slick1984 - thanks for the great feedback. Awesome to hear you found your groove with the game. We worked hard on the comfort of the game and are glad to hear that it worked out for you. We're introducing a mutliplayer queue feature in an upcoming release that should make it easier to find a mutliplayer game as the player base grows.
2022-05-28 14:44:18.766967,PinkyFloyd,"Fantastic game, perfect in VR","I've had my rift for a few months, bought all the big hitters yet this is the first time I have been moved enough to actually write a review.   I have an intense fear of heights and when I first tried Rush it scared the wits out of me, but I was having fun so persevered.  Thankfully the fear has mostly left me and what remains is buckets and buckets of FUN!  

The game controls superbly, looks pretty nice and is totally exhilarating.  The initial jump is always a blast but the courses so far have been really well thought out and the challenge has been rising incrementally with no sharp jumps.  I've been having too much fun in single player to try the multi-player but I have persuaded my friend to buy it so will get to try that soon.

I own about 15 VR games, yet this is the one that has moved me to write a review.  That pretty much says everything right there.  Well done Dev's, thanks for a great game and I seriously hope it gets the exposure it deserves.","Jun 8, 2018 at 5:16 AM",5, 10,Hi PinkyFlyod - thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. These are the type of stories we love to hear. We have a few people in the dev team with similar fear of heights and can fully relate to your journey with Rush. We hope you continue enjoying the game :)
2022-05-28 14:44:18.782925,AlphaQ77,,"The game looks like it could be really cool, but it is constantly pausing on me. On the race or time trials after 3 seconds of starting it pauses. I unpause and it pauses again. i havent been able to do more than the tutorial. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still pauses constantly. I am sure I am not accidently hitting buttons.","Jun 15, 2018 at 4:52 PM",3, 2,Hello AlphaQ77 - thanks for your feedback. Are you still encountering this issue? The 'B' button will pause the game during flight - are you by chance pressing it while flying?

2022-05-28 14:44:18.799880,grekb,Can improve,"I highly recommend it! I was kinda bored at first mountain but the game EXPLODES on second mountain! Its super fun! I had a problem on calibration at start that i baypassed by... kneeling a little? It is a mobile game and that is obvious in the graphics. I get a feeling the depth isnt exactly right. Everything seems bigger and closer than it should be. Anyway to fix that? Game is also demanding on hardware, but it shouldnt, so im pretty sure it can be tweaked with some update in the future. Will update my rating when ill play more. UPDATE: Thanks for the fast response. Win10pro x64, RAM 16GB, Intel Core i7 8700 @3.2Ghz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060-6GB, Samsung SSD 960 EVO 1TB, Rift on USB 3.1, Sensor on USB 3.0, everything up to date. Game Options(That the game can run ok): Render Scale -1.00, AntiAliasing -4x, Shadows -High, View Distance -Ultra, Texture Resolution -High, Grass Density -75%, Grass Shadows -Off, A.F. -On, Nametags -Off, Trails -On, Helmet -On. I can play the game on this settings i dont mind that much, but i think the depth(Eagle Eye?) needs some improvement.","May 13, 2018 at 11:45 PM",5, 8,"Hi grekb - thanks for sharing those details. If your performance isn't rock solid I would suggest dropping your grass density down to either 50% or 25%. It'll still look great but you'll get a huge performance boost (the grass is really hard on the GPU). As for your scale/depth comment, I believe that will be related to the calibration process that you had some issues with. The next update will improve that process and should correct any scale issues you may be seeing. Thanks again for the feedback!"
2022-05-28 14:44:18.815837,Lavender_Lavender,Almost there....,"I was very excited to install this game. I love the feeling of movement. Flying, roller coasters, falling....  I watched the preview video & thought that it was good for me. Unfortunately;  to fly around, you need to use your arms alot. Think Superman... 
In both the description and the trailer/video, it does not describe this. I did see however, flying with arms to the sides. If I could use the buttons, and stick on the touch controllers, that would be wonderful. See... I have a disability. It is what it is. 
The other issue for me, is that the inertia does not feel right to me. I feel like there needs to be more feeling of flying, speed, etc... It is not quite there. But... in reading some of the developer's responses; I have faith that this will be better in the future. 
Other then that... it is a nice game. There is much potential. I look forward to following this developer to see what he or she does with this game as well as future ones.","Jun 23, 2018 at 8:39 AM",4, 3,Hi Lavender_Lavender - thanks for taking the time to share your feedback with us. Have you tried using the Look or Tilt to steer options in the game? With either of those you are able to control all elements of flight without the use of the touch controllers. Perhaps one of those options might work better for you? Just go to 'Options' and in the 'Gameplay' tab you'll see the other control options. Hope it helps!
2022-05-28 14:44:18.832791,Aquavemo,"Great fun, even better later on!","Had a lot of fun so far, controls are spot on! Even though there are just four maps, there is a lot of variety in the tracks. But while playing i felt that something was missing. Here is what i think it is: While you can ""see"" the speed you can not ""feel"" it - but you definitely should. I would love to see a rumble effect added for the touch controllers to feel the air resistance, getting more intense when i make sharp turns. (Similar to a real sky diver can feel the wind doing manoeuvres.) This would also be a good opportunity to give the player an additional feedback for the flight controls and maybe would make the flying even more precise and ... fun.//Cool, i am looking forward to it!//Edit: The more I play it the better it gets. The later stages are so awesome! I easily give it 5 stars now!","Jun 14, 2018 at 4:15 AM",5, 9,UPDATE: We just released the update with haptic feedback - we hope this adds to your experience! Hi Aquavemo - thanks for the great feedback. We agree! We've been working on implementing proper rumble support in many of the ways you've touched on. Look for that (along with other new features) in the next update coming soon :)
2022-05-28 14:44:21.940645,BuLLeTTooThESQ,,"I have it for both gear vr and the rift. The rift version ups the graphics and adds the ability to fly with the touch controllers which adds a whole new challenge to the game vs. the gear vr. You can still fly with head turning or tilting as well. 
  Racing your friends is always fun.

I've given it 5 stars after playing it more.  The added grass effect is crazy. It is like you are cutting the grass with your face.  The trees and how you can fly under and through them is also an added feature.  It is a worthy upgrade from the gear VR version.","May 14, 2018 at 2:46 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:44:21.956603,leontang,Stuck on Calibration right after tutoria,"Update: With the update everything works perfectly now, thanks to the developer for fixing it quickly. Great game, and it doesn't give me a headache after a while like some other games do.

The game would have been great if not for the tiny problem of not being able to calibrate. It instructs me to hold my arms out so i do... for 3 minutes until i give up. I tried sitting down and nothing happened again. I wish i could just skip it and just play since it seemed like i could play the tutorial just fine

Update: With the update everything works perfectly now, thanks to the developer for fixing it quickly.

Hello leontang - sorry to hear about your calibration issues. You should be able to skip the calibration by restarting the game then when the calibration screen comes up asking if you want to sit or stand, select 'Back' and it will skip it. If you did want to try calibrating again, you can try holding your arms further back or forward once you are in the T pose. Regardless, we are finalising an update right now that will remove these calibration issues. Apologies again for the inconvenience caused."

I had issue when Calibration for Seated or Standing position, the game didnt recognize me and i cant bypass calibration. Now its ok, maybe issue with my sensors. But could help if bypass option for Calibration added.

Thanks for Devs response, i modify my review and waiting for patch if needed for other users. 

Edit : Do you plan a new mode for Pc release ? Free course to explore , with turbo always enabled and please if possible later... Spin & Looping could be awesome ! 
Thanks for this nice VR Game","May 12, 2018 at 5:28 PM",4, 1,"Hi ModaxFR - thanks very much for your feedback. The calibration is looking for a T pose which can sometimes be a little finicky to match - try slightly raising or lowering your arms from where you think it's correct and that should help. When the T pose figure starts filling green, hold that pose till full and you'll be done. We'll be sure to revisit this in the next patch making it a bit more forgiving. UPDATE: Yes, we are planning add a free-flight adventure mode soon :)"
