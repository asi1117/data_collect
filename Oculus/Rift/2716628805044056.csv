2022-05-28 18:32:30.371584,johnny_programmer,Informative and educational,"This is great. You get to go around part of Pompeii with photogrammetry and narration. I think this experience has a lot of educational value. Navigation is through gaze control, where you have to point your head towards markers, but it is possible to move around somewhat with roomscale.",13 days ago,4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:32:30.386544,cav800,So many lengthy loading screens,"This is just a 360 degree video VR experience where you float high above the streets with 2D static images of people and the ruins of Pompeii. You are pulled along with a slightly choppy frame rate by looking at green circles. These circles also provide informative conversations about each area. However, what ruined the immersion for me were the numerous lengthy and abrupt loading screens that seemed to be everywhere. This is something to experience maybe once, but most likely no more than that.","Apr 8, 2021 at 9:19 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:32:30.401504,Angelina Starr,Worth the price of admission w/ 1 caveat,"As one other user mentioned - while what is here is pretty awesome, there simply isn't enough of it.  I'd pay for additional DLCs that covered more areas like the forum, brothels, waterfront, victims, etc.  

One minor glitch - one of the narrators identified the 62 a.d. earthquake as 1962.  Oops.

But having said that, this is still a worthy walk for those interested in such things.  THe visuals and narration was great.","Nov 9, 2020 at 3:24 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 18:32:33.562050,johnnycaps,AD 79 Not a very good year.,"2020 a much better year.  The is a very educational program (except for some of the vieled snarky political comments that take you out of the immersion) .
The user interface quite frankly is especially pathetic,  maybe not for AD 79 but for 2017 onward - not so good.  The experience is still something to behold if your willing to suffer a bit and certainly not as much as the residents of this city in 79AD.  That's right AD not CE.","Feb 7, 2020 at 11:50 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:32:33.577011,PhillipUK,Thanks!,"Thank-you for this incredible experience. To anyone wondering, it's not just photographs, it's a complete scan of some of Pompeii which you can see from angles you wouldn't be able to in real life.","Mar 1, 2020 at 2:44 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 18:32:33.606930,db12590,"So much potential, but disappointing","I visited Pompeii in 2017 and it was the most amazing experience I have had travelling. When I saw this available I bought it and initially thought this was going to be great. The photography is top notch, visually this is gorgeous. The discussions regarding the rooms are interesting, though it is the visuals that I bought this to enjoy. The handsfree interface to move around is different. I don't know if I liked it or not. For me the real disappontment is that this covers such a small area within the ruins. What it covered is great, but there is too much left untouched. No Forum, no brothel, no amphitheatre, etc. I would have much prefered more photographic detail and less audio. Even text replacing audio if the audio is making the program too large to include other areas.  This is basically sections of 3 streets including the baths, a house, some shops. When I toured it, the forum was what took my breath away. I hope in time a more complete virtual tour of Pompeii becomes available. It was a life changing experience.","Jun 6, 2019 at 10:40 AM",3, 48,
2022-05-28 18:32:33.620893,nrosko,Up Pompei,"Very well made experience, content is over an hour. 
Some of the best, if not the best photogrametry i've seen so far, proper effort has gone into making the spaces look convincing with textures & modeling that is detailed. Sound is good with some excelent music effects & info/guidence. 
Due to the amount of content & quality there is more loading than usual but its worth while imo. 
One minor critism is locomotion you can choose to float to each location which is fine but the free locomotion was a bit irksome to use i just whanted to use my thumb stick. 
If you have any interest in history, documentories, virtual tourism then its certainly worth the small asking price.","May 10, 2019 at 9:40 PM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 18:32:36.708634,Zogger,Very good - room for improvement,"Interesting commentary which is absolutely worth the low price in itself - I learnt some things about Pompeii that I didn't learn by going there. Perhaps the most interesting part of Pompeii is covered - which is the main street, the house with the fountain and the baths. There are a few small issues though, which hopefully can be resolved.

The biggest issue for me is that the scale is off. Clearly there is a very detailed 3d model of pompeii, and it is really 6dof, but the scale of it is much larger than reality, i.e. it feels like the ground is far away and if you move your head forward you don't really get much closer to the what you're looking at. Perhaps this was a compromise to hide the rough edges at the limits of the photogammetry, and prevent you putting your head in walls, but I would much rather have true scale with some rough edges than this.

Other issues include - the commentary at the start assumes you've just come from another room (clearly a decision was made after the commentary was recorded!). At one point the commentary points out vesuvius at the end of the road but you can't see it from that location because of the navigation marker in the way.

I don't mind the navigation mode, it's clearly useful in parts because it takes you up to the ceiling etc. - however it can be a little obtrusive and when listening to the commentary you have to stop yourself looking at the other markers, lest you move to a marker and then have to go back to where you were and rewind to the beginning of that node's commentary. This is tedious because there's no way of fast forwarding and some of the commentary is minutes long. It would be nice to be able to walk around while listening instead of being forced to stay in place.

But overall these are minor niggles for a largely good experience.","Jun 7, 2019 at 3:23 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:32:36.724592,Kevin_Brook,Enjoyable but strange design choice,"I went to Pompeii a couple of years ago and it was nice to get a chance to relive parts of it in this app. The photography is great and really gives you a true sense of the place, if not the scale. It truly is a massive complex and even being there for several hours I didn't get close to seeing it all, so obviously cannot represent that here. What they do show is great and the commentary is decent and interesting. The app seemingly starts you off in the wrong location however. I began inside the Pompeii Roman Baths, with the commentary telling me I was now in the final room. You then leave that room and the commentary tells you that you are about to enter the final room (obviously it thinks you are coming not going) then when you get to the street the commentary begins with 'We are now leaving the street to enter our final destination the Roman baths'. In other words the commentary is all backwards. Clearly the narration is based on you starting at the entrance and wondering some streets before finishing in the baths but bizarrely you actually start in the baths and so the narration feels like you are walking backwards the whole time with it telling you the room you are about to is..... when in fact thats where you just left. If it wasn't for this strange choice its a five star app for the price. Still recommended.","May 21, 2019 at 8:50 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 18:32:36.739552,PoolfanVr,This is what VR is all about,"I've always wanted to go to Pompeii and until I do this is the closest experience you will get to being there.   I feared it would be a series of 3d images with commentary but it actually allows you to roam around as the software remodels the photos as you move - as good as I have seen for this type of experience - Think Google Earth at groud level but with photo-realistic graphics.

The commentary is excellent and there is lots to see and learn about, nothing can beat actually being there but this APP does let you examine and get closer and spend as long as you like examining detail as if you were there without any other tourists.  To top it off there are actually areas open that are not accessible if you visit the real thing.

Well done to all involved and priced very reasonably so if you have any interest in Roman history I'd urge you to puchase this.","May 25, 2019 at 1:54 AM",5, 5,
