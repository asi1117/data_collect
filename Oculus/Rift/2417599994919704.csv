2022-05-28 18:33:32.570224,Oberon101,Satisfying shooting wrapped with CoOp.,"**UPDATE**
The issue I was having with the shotgun has been resolved with the latest update. Shotgun now almost works flawlessly with my pump vr gunstock, the travel distance required for pumping is quite long. If it was a little shorter it would be great. 

Measuring the distance required between games such as Pavlov and Contractors the pump distance is around 6cm. While games like Resident Evil and After the Fall are in the 20cm area. If this distance could be shortened it would be great. 

With the addition of character skins and a new map to play on, me and my group of friends are excited to dive back into some Snowbreed blasting.

Now if we could get some sort of MP5 smg in here it would be a cherry on top of a very delicous cake.

Five Stars!

**OLD REVIEW**
Been looking forward to this one for many years now.

Me and my group of friends are thoroughly enjoying ourselfs working our way through the higher difficulties and gathering Harvest and rarer Floppy disks to upgrade our equipment.

Only gripe so far has been with the pump on the shotgun. It on occation will not shoot because the pump is not fully extended and hence the case eject bay slightly open. 

If the sensitivity on the pump could be lowered slightly so it would not pick up the small incriments when just aligning the controllers to aim.

For me a shotgun is the most iconic Zombie/Snowbreed/Horde slaying weapon and it would be great if it was more reliable.

Hopefully it´s something the developers can patch sooner rather than later.

The cross platform play is also great, even at the sacrifice of cool lighting effect it is great to be able to share the experience with the Quest crowd.

Great game and a recommended purchase.",Mar 26 at 5:32 PM,5, 17,

The gun holstrer does from time to time not even work, switching guns trhen means losing them in the middle of a battle.
The access to the in the sleeves stored boosters also doesnt work all the time and you even dont recognize that an enemy from behind eats you alive, not even a noise to hear or a optical warning that would make it possible to react.
All in all, i regret it that i spent money again for an unfinished game. Stop the madness, never buy alpha or early releases anymore.
Finish a game then sell a working copy, comprende senor developer.",Feb 7 at 3:01 AM,2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:33:35.761689,WhyKlef,This title is one not to miss. 4* Update,"<update> I've knocked one star down for now, after playing 5+ hours. The amount of glitches is quite astounding, and not positively. I thought Steam Discussion (who warned players of such) were playing an older build but nope, it's riddled with bugs. </update>

SUPPORTS CROSS-BUY!!

With cross-play between PSVR, Oculus and Steam, we are more likely to find a community for a long time. The game promotes weapon progression so yes, while it is similar to a Left 4 Dead, it offers far more replayability. The shooting is extremely satisfying and overall there isn't much to fault this game on.

It's an amazing display of VR shooting multiplayer and one that is not the old rehash wave formula that we've seen over and over.

In fact, this game reminds me of a very underrated VR title which unfortunately, released way ahead of it's time...

This game gives me Gunheart nostalgia, versus which it offers less progression. However, it is more polished and uses a winning formula (zombie) versus one that can be ""hit 'n miss"" for some (sci-fi planets w/ giant bugs). Still, this proves that if they were to re-release the other title, it'd probably be extremely successful as this is very close in spirit.

Anyway back to After the Fall, it was worth the wait, it is early to sing it's praise, however this game has the potential for a higher retention rate than most VR games. It's fun, yet simple enough to pick up, but also with great multiplayer implementation, matchmaking, crossplay, in-game voice, in-game friend list with intuitive and easy ways to add people, lobby... They nailed the online portion which is fundamental, plus the game will release on Quest 1 in 2022.

Congratulations Vertigo Games, if Arizona Sunshine was somewhat of a ""proof-of-concept"", you showed your experience as developers with this title that improves on almost EVERY aspect.",Dec 14 at 10:52 PM,4, 56,
2022-05-28 18:33:35.777646,McNugget6750,Needs several fixes rather urgently!,"Dear Developers,
The game is indeed a lot of fun. So far, we did one session only. However, it took my group of friends about 1h to get everything set up and running together.
Here are a couple things that really stood out that need fixing pretty much as soon as you can:
- When people join a party in the lobby, voice chat is a must. It's impossible to coordinate otherwise. We spent almost half an hour to figure out why we cannot hear or see each other in the lobby even though we were all online and there. - MUST FIX
- Reloading in advanced mode is seriously broken: I oftentimes wasn't able to get the magazine into the gun without physically crashing my controllers into each other. The mags often end up outside of the pistol instead of the mag slot. In addition, many times my mags just fell to the ground or flipped back into my holster for no apparent reason. During the heat of the fight, this is kind of game breakingly frustrating! Cogging the weapon should be either trigger finger or both grip and trigger. Currently it's grip button only, which seems extremely counter intuitive. Often, the weapon then just changes hands because people were still pressing the grip button on the weapon hand, too. - HIGH PRIORITY
- Jumping of a level to another level from one frame to the next is extremely irritating as there is no feedback about what happened. I get that it might make people slightly sick when falling is done at a realistic speed but I'm sure there is a middle ground and that would be configurable in the settings! - Medium priority
- There should be a warning that you and some of your team members are connected in a party with voice chat in the oculus quest environment when entering an in-game party. This causes other people to not be able to hear the ones that are using Oculus voice as the microphone is already in use. This was a major issue and caused us to abort the first game as we could not hear all the party members. - also High Priority",Dec 12 at 11:06 AM,3, 42,
2022-05-28 18:33:35.792606,ClarkyTheSharky,"Incredibly fun, amazing potential","I'm a long-term gamer. I started gaming on the Apple II and Atari 2600, long before NES. I've played more games than I can count. After The Fall is one of my very favorite games.

Is this really a 5 star game?  My opinion is yes, if we mentally edit the game title from ""Launch Edition"" to ""Early Access"".  I view early access as a practical way for indie game studios to continue development.  It's rediculous for huge companies like EA or Activision, but very understandable for indie studios.

After playing for about 16 hours (12 on PC, 4 on Quest 2), here are my opinions:

The good:
- Very enjoyable gameplay loop.
- Plently of replayability.
- Amazing visuals on PC, surprisingly good on Quest 2.
- The guns feel good and are fleshed out (can chamber check, etc).
- Plenty of weapon mods and color/skin options.
- Ammo quantity adds another dimension of fun, forcing you to strategize and swap weapons.
- Frantic, exciting gameplay. No other VR game compares. Much more frantic than Saints & Sinners.
- The difficulty levels feel well tuned, and the gameplay is challenging without feeling unfair.
- Decent variety of enemies (slow zombies, fast zombies, floor/ceiling crawling zombies, explosive enemies, slow bullet sponges, and a monstrous boss).
- Getting this running on Quest 2 was an epic feat of engineering.
- The 5 maps are a good length and decently varied.
- It's cross buy (get both the PC and Quest 2 versions).
- Matchmaking is usually very fast.
- Automatic co-op, party co-op, and single-player are all fully supported.
- Actually has a story!
- Cross play.
- FPS is buttery smooth.
- Accessible but very high skill ceiling.

The okay:
- Could use more weapons, enemy types, and environments.
- No skill ranking.

The bad:
- If the host leaves/drops then all progress from the run is lost.
- Needs more maps and story.
- Can't pick your avatar.

This game is incredibly fun as-is, and I'm confident will grow into a must-buy.",Dec 16 at 12:49 AM,5, 33,

2022-05-28 18:33:38.892315,EthicalGoat,Almost Everything You Wanted,"It's not difficult to see that AtF has some potential to be a 5-star VR zombie shooter...but between the egregious amount of bugs and limited content, it's far from what it could be capable of.

Map clipping, server issues, weapon and item glitches...there's a lot of work that needs to be done before AtF really blossoms. Admittedly, when I first start playing, these setbacks don't seem so bad (perhaps I was blinded by the lustre and excitement of a new game)...but they can really make a difference when you start to play at higher difficulties.

Speaking of difficulties, the easier game settings lose their appeal if you're a decent shot with some minor weapon upgrades. The 5 maps are easy to memorize, and enemy spawns quickly become predictable. However, Master and Nightmare (!!) can still provide a surprisingly challenging atmosphere even for the most familiar of players and sharpest of shooters.

Despite AtF's long list of setbacks, it is enjoyable and exciting for a few hours, but is not something to write home about. With some TLC from developers, it could turn into a must-buy.",Jan 31 at 11:22 PM,3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:33:38.908273,xXxAussieBxXx,Big let down,"This game had big expectations. Super wonkey, the same thing after an hour or so of play. Very reptitive, not a long term game just something to try out.",Feb 11 at 2:12 AM,2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:33:38.923233,NodnarbDB,"Will be great, but some big flaws now.","So upon launch I'll say the game is just about up to the hype.  I have some things I’d like to see improved to really keep me coming back.  It’s worth the price, but I think it’s more of a good foundation than a completed game.    
Pros:
* yes it’s fun and awesome and plays well.  
* good gun upgrade system – unlocks higher difficulties as you upgrade and improves experience 
* maps are good overall, not a bad start.
Cons:
Folks have mentioned the bugs in more detail – no lobby chat, AFK party leaders get people stuck in lobby, if party leaver leaves a match everyone loses progress etc.  Yes those need to be fixed.

HERE ARE MINE: 
* THE INVENTORY SYSTEM IS FRUSTRATING.  Keeping items in your wrist is terrible trouble for a fast paced shooter – especially frustrating when you can’t hand rifles from one hand to another.  Trying to grab something from your off hand can be a clunky juggle of death when THEY SHOULD JUST BE ON YOUR BELT  
*no physical interaction with enemies other than shooting them – can’t push away or hit them..
* Needs a few more objectives to run through as you progress in difficulties.  Right now the only reason to want to play higher difficulties is that your guns level up and it gets too easy and to level up your guns more you need to get the disks in the harder modes.  THAT’S IT.  So the game will be hard, then easy, then hard then easy then hard...then easy..  It’s the same over and over with only some locations changing of where stuff is and where enemy waves get triggered.
** SO, have a few objectives cycle through like rescueing a lost survivor (one player unfreezes while others have to fight off waves then have to give them a weapon and keep them alive).  Repairing harvest route (blasting through ice blocking the way while waves come, forcing team to split up to coordinate an effort), Restock (have to carry boxes in one hand through to marked areas eliminating ability to carry extra stuff in hand).  Stuff like that could go a long way.",Jan 4 at 3:24 AM,3, 4,
2022-05-28 18:33:38.939190,MaXiMuM-V,4.5 -> Changed to 3,"Waited a bit before writing this review. I pre-ordered and I was waiting on this one since I got into VR and bought the Quest1. World did not make it past the 80's ? I am sold.

For me this title lives up to my expectations (mostly). They got all the hard stuff right and true crossplay is just awesome for VR in general. 

The game is fun an varied, every time  I play a level again I am constantly surprised when I think I know how a stage is going to go, and it throws a curveball at me. In some cases the change is subtle and you really have to know what your looking for, very organic high replay value.

I have played on PCVR and Quest Native and honestly the only thing I miss is the flashlight (greatly) from the PC version. 

The ""line"" is  a good example of what a Meta Portal could be, its pretty bare at the moment but  you can see the barebones framework that has many possibilities with additional updates. I think would be cool if you could free chat in the lobby, If all titles had and area like this and you could Jump between them, in an organic fashion you could really start to create the feeling of in being in the ""Metaverse"". 

Shooting in this game is satisfying and I love the advanced reload, and the fact you get better harvest for using this mode. 

Hopefully there will be a ""80's Mall"" map in future DLC/Updates. I can envision it being a bit challenging however if you freeze 80's and you don't get to harvest a mall, life is not worth living :-) 

Yes there are bugs, and a few dropped matches before you get into one. Hopefully this area can continually be improved/optimized. Its frustrating to get into a map and either its over because someone drops or ""kicked"". 

Update: 1/10/22 Changing to 3 stars until they update, this game drove me back to xbox for a while. There is nothing worse than wasting time just to have host leave, game crash etc, seemed worse after the last update.

maybe after a couple patches I will consider giving this title my time again.",Jan 12 at 4:53 AM,3, 7,

2022-05-28 18:33:42.067822,edgecrush3r,The most thrilling game you get!,"I really hope this game will set the bar for all future VR games. The graphics on both PCVR and Quest 2 are really amazing. The fact that this game is crossbuy AND crossplay was already pretty impressive. But this game actually also keeps all your progress in cloud, so unlike other games you dont loose any progress when switching. However there are only 5 levels right now, the levels them selves are at about 25-30min each, really decent and longer then i expected them for this type of game. The way that co-op is implemented in this game is really good, and because its crossplay there will be plenty of people to join your squad. Gameplay and sound design really makes this game AAA, and the co-op is incredibly well done (better than any other VR shooter at the moment). If this game came with 8 or 10 levels it would have been a 5 star, but i hope that the devs have already plan on doing more seasons. Often this game is compared to Left 4 Dead in VR, but this immersiveness is just sooo much better then you have experienced.",Dec 18 at 12:17 AM,4, 6,

Absolutely. But right now the game has so many bug the game feels like it's still in beta.

Problem is, the upgraded guns keep reverting to their basic form every time I enter a new game. Yet my currency is gone. Complete waste of time. Mics are all echoing, enemies rubber banding , you can get stuck on certain terrain, fall though the map, If the host player disconnects everyone's game disconnects.

Option one is to move your gun hand towards your body and press a button. Like an old arcade game you played as a kid. Option 2 is a more modern VR way and makes you eject the magazine, grab a new magazine from your belt, put the new magazine into your gun, then rack the slide of the weapon. Option 1 works great. Option 2(the manual reload) does not work at all. 50% of the time the magazine I reload ends up empty, so i reload twice, or I end up grabbing some random item during my reload and have to drop it, try to grab from my belt again, then try to insert. Also there is a bug that when you try to rack the slide AFTER you insert a new magazine, you just switch hands. So here you are, trying to rack the slide but you just keep swapping the gun between your right and left hand.",Dec 11 at 9:52 AM,3, 7,

Headshots are soooooooooo satisfying. The way they fall apart is great too. The mini bosses are cool to looks at, but scary good fun. I love that run actually is a run, in a lot of games when you run it’s just a tiny bit faster than walking, but not in this game. I love that you can adjust your height at anytime too.

Weapon selection is nice, 2 assault rifles, 2 pistols, shotgun and uzi. I hear there is more coming which is great. Cough cough LMG? cough. Each gun has modifications you can find during your runs and better ones can be found in more difficult runs.

In fact, I have only two complaints, this is the angle of the weapon and manual reloading.

1. Gun angle settings. It's a MUST HAVE. 
This is a very important thing to feel and enjoy playing. Since I played a lot of Pavlov and pistol whip. And I have a big surprise when first launch ""Arizona Sunshine"" and a gun was tilted 20 degrees up. Fortunately, there was an option to tilt it ""right way"". I can say that the ""correct"" position of the pistol in the game, changes quite a lot, in terms of feeling (For now, the pistol orientation is about 5 degrees up from the ""normal"" position), I'm used to a certain position of the pistol in the game. And if you can configure it so that it matches the position of the hand in reality (I searched through all the settings, but did not find this parameter, maybe I'm just stupid, tell me where it is.) it will be very good.


2. Manual reloading... Please, ad option to chenge it to triger button. I don’t know who suggested this, that you need to use grip button to take out the mag\shell and to cogging the shutter. But he\she needs to knock on the head. (no offence) . It may be convenient for someone, but in this case, add the ability to change to the trigger button.

I understand this is just a launch and maybe in the future you will add a lot and improve it. And I hope my feedback somehow influences it.
Best wishes for the development of the project.

2022-05-28 18:33:51.538491,xxxXaLiVeXxxx,Great game but....,"Pros
1. Graphics - some of the best graphics ever seen in quest 2 
2. Gameplay - very addictive and a challenging
3. Multiplayer - easy to connect with friends after figuring out how to work everything
4. Story - Good once you figure out you need to speak with the girl in hub.

Once the cons are addressed I will revise back to 5 stars. Love the game and only want to see become the best it can be. It's amazing and worth the investment. 

Currently it's my favorite game on quest/rift.

Cons
1. Getting stuck in walls or doors ( stairs etc.) Causes screen to turn black and stop you from moving.

2022-05-28 18:33:51.554449,The.Real.Mr.Breeze,Literally the best VR zombie shooter,"I've got about 5 hours in and completed the first 4 harvest runs in group play and I can honestly say that this game is fantastic.  The gunplay and movement feels really good.  No motion sickness but I do play a good amount of VR.  Using manual reload despite the extra money you receive is feels quite challenging while you're trying to kite around snowbred and can cause some panic moments :)  The harvest hordes and monsters feel paced properly and while sometimes the hordes can be overwhelming the game is a blast and feels fairly well balanced on easier levels (Haven't tried harder ones).

The handheld rocket launcher is awesome and the accesories and the upgrade/crafting are simple enough to be engaging but not too complex to slow the game down.  Would like to see some form of melee make it into the game at some point but more as a CC like Left4Dead and not like an OP zombie grinder like Back4Blood.  The bots are also not too bad on the easier difficulty settings.  I had just gotten my hands on the Carbine on my last harvest run and am excited to try it out next play.

It does have some bugs like when I got my rocket launcher and went into the next run, I lost all my guns for some reason.  The smooth movement via stick sometimes (PC Oculus as I haven't tried the Quest 2 standalone yet) feels like its moving forward and sideways and not straight forward.  This creates some confusion when trying to move a specific direction when being overrun by a hor de.  I thought it might be me but when I play Contractors, Zero Caliber, Onward, etc. movement is correct.  Pulling down on the right stick to turn 180 and sprint away from a horde is a game-changer instead of trying to angle turn or physically turn 180.  While the game has its issues and ""seems"" light on content so far, it's a lot of fun and I know with updates this game has a ton of potential to get even better.  Kudos devs!  I am actually enjoying this more than AZ Sunshine but it could be I enjoy this genre more!",Dec 10 at 12:55 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:33:51.570406,NukeJockey,Phenomenal Cooperative Shooter,"Excellent game, looks and runs great on modest hardware (GTX1070 on a Quest 2). game has several difficulty levels which are very challenging and fun. There are a bunch of weapons all with a heap of upgrades that you unlock through playing, with the idea being that you are a runner, you start in a subway below the ground, which acts as your lobby, you can see dozens of other players running around and interacting with the world while you are there too. You can then join a public match or create a private match where you can invite friends. The gameplay loop early on is already rewarding and addictive. Can't wait to play more. Very solid game all around.",Dec 10 at 11:45 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:33:51.586363,Raishiwi,VRs BEST NEW MULTIPLAYER GAME,I don't write reviews. I have been playing VR since the launch of the HTC vive in 2016 and since then have played 70+ VR games on different platforms. This game is hands down the most replayable multiplayer game for VR ive ever played. All the charm of L4D and Back for Blood with all the immersion and anxiety that VR can bring.,Dec 25 at 11:15 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:33:51.602321,joshoftheflame,love it. needs some polishing.,"Love this game so far, however, there are a few issues I should point out. There are a lot of player lobbies that never start because of an afk host. very annoying. also solo AI could use a bit of a combat tactics buff. and a few glitches here and there like a graphics glitch or getting stuck in a wall. aside from that I enjoy the weapons and the game mechanics. Love the level design. Personally, I'd love to see more weapons in the future. I enjoy being able to tweak weapons. might I suggest the ability to zero sights in the future? might be fun, idk lol. thank you for making the game devs =)",Dec 22 at 10:41 AM,5, 1,

2022-05-28 18:33:54.734942,Kravitch_cz,Good game but...,".. to much bugs..

- AI members are stupid. The constantly runs in your line of fire. And they often do nothing. Just standing and watching being killed. So game is unplayable in solo on higher difficulty.

- Sometimes your gear can completely vanish after you return to hub. And not only weapons, your harvest can vanish too.

- I already unlocked top tier upgrade (red floppy) laser sight. But it is not available ingame :D",Dec 17 at 5:28 PM,3, 1,
