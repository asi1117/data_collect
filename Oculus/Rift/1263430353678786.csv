2022-05-28 15:45:15.022973,Willard007,Update this for Quest controllers?,"I really liked playing this on the Rift.  After completing all the levels of Spacefolk City on the Quest, I decided to try your game again.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to recognize the Quest controllers.  It highlights the gaming controller but not sure how to get that to work with my Quest yet.",Feb 18 at 11:05 AM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 15:45:15.036936,Ryanagon,"Fun, but can be frustrating","It's a fine game that needs some tweaks imo.   There are tedious parts to it that really aren't necessary imo.   Why must I constantly hold down a button the whole game so that I can suck up spirit energy?  It just seems like an unnecessary thing... have it collect automatically.    Also, if I make a peep a farmer I would like them to seek out fields on their own, prospectors, miners, etc... have them go do what they are meant to do unless I tell them otherwise.      If they fight, I'd like them to resume what they were doing after.   These micro things are simply not fun and detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.","Mar 5, 2019 at 2:53 AM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 15:45:15.051896,Nonebetter,Great game - fun in and out of VR,"This game is super fun and cute, plus its nice to feel like a god sometimes.

It can be really hard in the later levels, too hard for me, but I still have a ton of fun playing the levels I can handle.

Lots of ways to strategize, combine units, be careful what jobs you send guys on, always try to upgrade things.","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:46 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:45:15.067853,shminkey297,great game lacking a couple things,"This brings back the feeling of the first time a played command & conquer or populus.  It is a feeling that I havent had in a long time, as most games dont have the variety from the normal to make me feel that way again.  crawling your way around the world adds to the feeling of being there.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it lacks some things that need to exist in these types of games.  you only can direct one peep at a time, and you cant hot key specific classes (like warriors or miners).  Having these features would make it easier during the intense times and move faster through the dull times.  Also I want to be able to hold the peeps and maybe set one on my shoulder as I go around on my god duties.","Sep 19, 2018 at 2:38 AM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 15:45:18.209450,slewis7,Excellent god game,"Very cute graphics and plenty of depth.  The tutorial teaches you the essentials, but there are plenty of things left to discover.  While some of the touch controls seem slightly clunky when introduced in the tutorial, they do a great job of allowing you to jump around and quickly get to helpful viewpoints.  This is a really great game value.","Jun 4, 2018 at 1:10 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:45:18.223413,prisoner1369,Bad Support but User Tip Helped,Downloaded the game. Does not load in Rift. Screen locks in headset. Launch came from desktop and it shows the menu and to put on headset. Put on headset and screen goes blank. UPDATE1: using the ALT+TAB I read in another review worked. Once I have a day to play more I'll update my rating. Too bad the dev support was not responsive to this common issue.,"Mar 2, 2018 at 6:51 AM",2, 19,
2022-05-28 15:45:18.238373,Tyboderek,"To much work, not enough Play.","First hour is fun but as you advance nuisances drag the game down. The premise is: harvest resource, defend from monsters at night. However, you can only control units individualy. Once your settlement reaches 10+ units, it really becomes work: you zoom out, move the map, zoom in, rotate, select unit, move map, select new destination. Or if they are perfectly in frame you can skip to selecting one unit at a time giving command and then rinse/repeat. I don't know, i wish i could capture how tedius it becomes in words. Another example: you can specialize a unit into a certain resource gatherer like farmer, lumberjack, warrior, etc. But overnight they scatter while fighting enemies and do not resume their jobs. You have to look at each character individualy, identify their specialty and then send them back to work at the correct location. When you have 15 units and you want to find the one miner to put back on the quary, it becomes a real headache.","Feb 28, 2018 at 1:14 PM",2, 19,

For anybody currently having troubles getting this to run in VR, I had similar issues, what fixed it for me was to alt tab between Oculus Home and the game then back again, it then springs to life in the headset once more.","Feb 28, 2018 at 1:08 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:45:21.387949,SengirShowsU,Cute Game with a great Blueprint,"It is a very cute ""little"" game with plenty of polish for the money. The VR mechanics work great and the scale of the world and the changing of it while ""zooming"" is a great blueprint for other VR titles. A lot of fun for old and young alike. Just do not expect a highly complicatet rts. It is more like creatures meets settlers.","Mar 19, 2018 at 11:23 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 15:45:21.416872,pij,All in all a pretty dull experience,"Gather resources during the day, fight monsters at night, expand your base. Rinse and repeat. Tethered comes off as a cozy and child friendly game, and while the goal of the game is very simple, the poor mechanics for managing your base actually makes it quite hard, fruitless and frustrating to play. All in all a pretty dull experience. With this in mind, not to forget your Peeps actually commit suicide if you don't do things right, it certainly isn't a childrens game. But if you are looking to kill some time (and Peeps) I suppose this is as good an option as any. Two stars for the nice graphics and a nice but poorly executed idea.","Mar 1, 2018 at 4:56 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 15:45:24.536528,NintenDex,"Unfortunately, the game doesn't work","I was quite excited to get into this game, but what I found instead was a bunch of technical problems. The game window will open, but as soon as I put on the headset, the screen freezes. I've seen no one else online come across this issue, so I hope this is something the developers can fix in the future. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm running this on a laptop? If the devs could help out on this, it'd be great.","Feb 24, 2018 at 4:24 AM",1, 8,

A classic RTS in the tradition of Clash of Clans, Black & White or Populous (if you're old enough). I really love it and it's great to watch someone else play, which is rare.","Oct 9, 2017 at 4:24 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:45:30.849642,74Loki,"Fun, cute, sad at times ..... Hectic","The Peeps are pretty cute and the gameplay is engaging albiet hectic. At times you feel very hurried and harried trying to keep everyone busy and alive. It's sad when you have a Peep commit suicide. The first time I saw that I thought, ""How very dark of them to have the Peeps do that"". 
It's a strain on your touch controllers batteries as you are using them constantly and I do mean constantly. You are forced, at all times, to do one thing or another which can be maddening but also what makes the game fun.","Oct 4, 2017 at 8:47 PM",4, 3,

It's one of the most fascinating games on the Rift, it does feel like playing The Settlers all over again, but the graphics are beyond my wildest imagination! You simply can't go wrong with this game! Touch controls work like a charm. 
I read that some persons had problems starting this game, but it works perfectly on my PC - I'm using the good ol' Forceware 391.35 if that may help.","Dec 2, 2018 at 7:48 AM",5, 3,

It was annoying trying to keep up with everything and I felt it derailed the flow of the game for me.. It felt more like a brain workout game, than actual fun for me.

2022-05-28 15:45:34.051080,jpwatler,Now with save!,"Update: The devs added save check points on every map. I just played for a bit, quit the game and picked up where i left off. yay! Its a good game. If you like this sort of thing, pick it up, its worth it! (now)

old review: Great game if only you could save and quit and then continue when you come back. As of right now you have to play every island in one sitting (taking between 30 and 90 mins). Check ""save during island"" on the discussion forum on this game's steam page.

As one developer put it: ""the game does save your progress each time you complete a level <island> - we're not complete monsters!).""
Joking that as least we didn't make you play all 13 in one sitting. Im also not a monster so Im giving the game two stars. Add any sort of save option and this we be a 4-5 star for sure.","Apr 13, 2017 at 10:59 AM",4, 9,

When I beat one it does not show up on the leader board even though it would be second place. My times are still on the leader board in first position but its like the game doesn't know that it's me. :( not sure who to contact to fix it. That aside, this has been a very entertaining game.

2022-05-28 15:45:37.208634,WryZed,An enjoyable little romp!,"Ported over from a PSVR title, this charming little game is not, as some would suggest, a Black & White(ish) game, but much closer to the likes of Cultures from the old days of gaming.

The graphics are impressive, sound is pleasent and the options cater for a number of control settings.

All in all a serene, slower paced game, although it gets a little hectic toward night.

Having only played the tutorial so far I can't account for the later levels, but it does have many and it looks as though this will take many, many hours to complete.

All in all, it's about time a god-like(lite) strategy(lite) game came to VR!","Feb 28, 2017 at 5:35 AM",4, 20,

2022-05-28 15:45:40.348237,Duncan_Disorderly,"Still good, despite being so cute.","I hate cute. Cute is the last thing I want a game to be. This game is cute. Gut wretching, stick my fingers down my throat cute. Yet, somehow it didn't bother me, not one bit. In fact, the smaller you make the game, the cuter they got. The reason why the cuteness was bearable had to do with gameplay. It's not exactly like Black & White, but it's along those lines, just to give you an idea. Basically, collect resources, set tasks, build things, protect the community. I loved the barracks because these little guys are adorable as little soldiers trying to look all tough and kill things. The graphics are brilliant. It's like looking at a tiny live model.  

So, if you hate cute like I do and think this game doesn't look good because of the sugary cuteness, reconsider. You'll probably be in for a surprise.","Feb 28, 2017 at 3:34 PM",5, 25,

- A lot of levels which will keep you occupied for awhile, as well as some interesting map designs
- It's a little hard to manage your villagers, I wish there was a clear UI to tell who was doing what, especially since at night things get frantic and I move guys around a lot
- I think there's only one type of enemy, more diversity would be cool!
- Interesting buildings and there are some good strategies that open up.
