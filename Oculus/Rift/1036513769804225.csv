2022-05-28 19:11:09.865278,natmaxex,bad head position,When I start the game I'm looking in the wrong direction. I can force it to look forward by going into the menu while playing turn my head and reset my forward-looking direction.,"Mar 9, 2019 at 1:30 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:12.970972,TeacherAuthor,,"One of my favorite ""roller coasters"" until the update several months ago. Now the view is skewed to one side and the ride is very choppy. And the designer does not respond to emails.","Jul 25, 2018 at 2:50 PM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 19:11:12.999894,Aden777,Not the best graphics,There isn't really gameplay so I expected the graphics to be a bit better. They were ok but a bit disapointing expecially because this was a paid game. If it was free I would have given it more of a pass.,"Oct 20, 2017 at 9:41 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:13.014854,r0b1nw,Created for cinema/ motion platform,"First had this experience at a theme park (Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight) - it was a '4D' experience. Basically a small cinema, 3D (with polarised glasses) and the audience (around 80 per sitting) all seated on a motion platform. While the movements were fairly crude and not particularly well syncronised with the video it added a lot to the experience and the 3D effect was more pronounced than it is in this VR version. My kids loved it and went three or four times on the same day. It's a relatively cheap way to make some extra revenue I guess, adapt for VR and charge some money. 3D is headache inducingly 'off' at times, frame rate is low, resolution is low but that's true for the majority of 360 content at the moment - 'We are Stars' being a stellar exception to the rule if you run the Ultra quality version, have a decent GPU and get the LAV Filters installed and configured correctly. Having said all that I bought this specifically as a 'nostalgia' piece for my kids and they enjoyed watching it again for that reason. So, 3 stars from me.","Jul 5, 2017 at 3:46 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:13.029814,ProphetBlind,An unplayable video,Don't be fooled. This is just a video. It also stutters like crazy and is completely unwatchable from my machine which has no problem running actual games like Robo Recall. Waste of money.,"Jun 20, 2017 at 8:29 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:16.101598,im.visualcortex,Cool & Very Original,I hope this game will be released in 3D some day. 360° video barely has depth what ruins immersion considerably.,"Jun 19, 2017 at 10:18 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:11:16.118553,beatet,Not good,"If this app was rendered instead of a crappy 360 video, it will worth it.","Apr 19, 2017 at 9:38 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:11:16.134510,Sinsei,Not Recommended,"The idea is neat and it would certainly be a great experience if the technical side of it wouldn't be so horrendous.
It feels like it is a video and not something rendered on the pc. This would also explain the framerate. The framerate is stable.. but feels like it is stable at the 20 fps mark, like they just didn't render it higher if it is really a video. 
Certain parts were looking.. strange? i would say. Like something that should be obviously be in front (the wall) when you look at it, looks like it is behind something else (the sea behind the wall).
Last but not least the resolution. It doesn't look like the demo-video (on the developers site)/screenshots at all, looks more like 480p (on the normal pc screen). But there is nowhere an option menu to be found and also nothing to change in the installation folder.","Feb 5, 2017 at 4:07 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 19:11:16.150468,cybernettr,Roller coaster on The Great Wall,"This is basically like a roller coaster experience. I didn't have a problem with the frame rate, but the experience was slightly fuzzy, like I was watching a video rather than actual computer graphics. Clever idea but the execution was sadly lacking.","Jan 23, 2017 at 1:39 PM",2, 3,
