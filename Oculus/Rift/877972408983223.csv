2022-05-28 19:54:23.511600,byteframe,Looks cool.,"But I didn't have a controller to play it, and the emulation on my Quest wasn't working. From the features and aesthetic glean-able from the main menu, I wanna rate this a 4.","Jun 8, 2021 at 12:15 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:54:23.527065,tamoore,Great game!,"The recent update fixes the rumble issue!  Thanks for that Dev!.

This is a cool game with stuff for everyone.   Want to race?  It's there.  Want to bomb around with an RC car in open environment full of jumps and obstacles?  It's there.  Want to time-trial?  It's there.   Want to knock into exploding basketballs?   Sure, that too.   

This is just VR fun.   Recommended.","Dec 7, 2020 at 6:41 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 19:54:23.558980,emdoyle,Xbox 360 controller keeps vibrating,"As reported by MarquisDeSang on Jul 18, 2017, the Xbox 360 wireless controller vibrates endlessly during a race. On Jul 21, 2017, developer Rod said he would add an option in the next update to turn off vibration. Is that update still forthcoming (almost a year later)? Apart from this issue, it seems like this would be an enjoyable game. Would the developer consider implementing support for Oculus Touch as a gamepad? This ought to give the game broader appeal today.","Jun 19, 2018 at 7:12 AM",1, 3,This has been fixed.  I am looking at adding Touch controller support.  Thank you for the suggestion.
2022-05-28 19:54:23.573940,pabe05,Too Cheap,"What alot of fun.  Just racing around and jumping and knocking into objects is well worth the price.  Signing in if you want is painless.  Email isnt even asked for.
Your view can be from almost anywhere including from above on a tower.

Also have vibration issue with a xbox one controller.

2022-05-28 19:54:26.725066,MarquisDeSang,Controller forever  vibrating,Impossible to play because the controller will forever vibrate and never stop until I close the game. I am asking for a refund. And there are no option to turn off the awful music.,"Jul 19, 2017 at 9:37 AM",1, 0,I apologize for the problem.  It was not affecting everyone.  It has now been fixed.
2022-05-28 19:54:26.740027,Mike1304,Wonderful game!,I enjoy this game so much! Would be cool if in the graphics menu would have more options; for example the possibility to raise the pixel-density. In this game this is important so that you can see your car in the far distance better...,"May 6, 2017 at 2:15 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:54:26.753989,Astromarkus,"Simple, Fun and straight to the Point!!","RC playground has everything going right, Great amount of tracks to start off with, Has a progression system by beating times to move onto the next track, Has a mini game built into the freeroam/playground area. The RC physics are as well very precise, it has a very natural feel to controling a real RC car. The implementation of being able to move to certain vantage points to veiw your car is a great addition, aswell with the idea of being able to see first person perspective on a ipad in game(GREAT IDEA). Another plus is that the Developer has said that more tracks and touch support are to come, this is a Great buy for the price and with online ranking built in you cant go wrong. Cheers!","Feb 3, 2017 at 2:14 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:54:26.769952,azm88,Add Controls Configuration,The game is really fun & realistic! I only wish that the controls configurations can be changed. I am used to playing racing games using the left thumbstick for steering & the trigger buttons for acceleration & braking.,"Feb 9, 2017 at 6:32 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:54:29.850295,aeonblack,"Simple game, super challenging, fun","This is one of those rare games that truly challenges you with it's core mechanics. The cars are not forgiving to drive, but they reward practice by giving precise control (the same way a real R/C car does). I really like the online leaderboards, as it gives you goals to shoot for on each level. The environment design is fun and makes it feel less like punishment when you mess up and when you pull off a sweet jump or nail a set of corners, it totally makes you grin. 

Simple, fun, challenging and with a good price to match that.","Nov 18, 2016 at 5:35 AM",5, 6,
