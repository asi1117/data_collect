I love how many options there are, I prefer to teleport but there’s also smooth gliding walking options too. 
There are some achievements to earn along the way and I loved the immense atmosphere in every scene you play.

2022-05-28 12:38:34.114610,shane.creamer,Don't bother for a year 2020/21 player,"I just came into the world of VR and my first experience was Half Life Alyx.  The graphics here are at least 2 generations old as in the 2017-2018 timeframe and are very hard on the eyes.  Looking through a Quest 2 headset or even on my game monitor this looks like PlayStation 1 graphics.  The controls do not feel intuitive and have been long surpassed by better games.  

If you want to see what a 2019-2020 Science Fiction VR game in space is all about I highly recommend Lone Echo instead.

So: Do I hate this game? No, in fact I would re-consider this game if it was remastered. It just is a game that is long past its prime and made for much earlier revisions of VR gear.","Nov 25, 2020 at 4:01 PM",3, 14,

2022-05-28 12:38:37.280742,JackDuk,"Not bad, but not great for the cost","After playing a few other VR titles like Half Life Alyx and Lone Echo (released a few years ago now), I was a little let down a bit by this title. I'm all for Indie games, but not at premium prices. At the time of purchase, Lone Echo was just £10 more than this game, but is considerably more game for your green. 

Red Matter is OK, there's just no story to the red matter, or very little story at all. The controls and movement are a little clunky and take a bit of getting used to. Transportation would have been better than ""floating"" over to your next position. But I guess the longer transition was designed to add some length to the game because it isn't very long at all. 

I don't think I got more than 3 hours out of it, which for £18.99 isn't on par with what I'd expect at that price. There are no other characters in the game, the only interaction is a voice in your ear, and some spooky dude who doesn't speak. I was a fan of the old Red Faction games, this is nothing like it so don't be fooled.

There is some attention to detail, but the depth just isn't there. In Lone Echo, the planet looked like a planet, whereas here it looked more a 2D projection in a 3D space. Textures were basic throughout and the physics was a little un-natural. 

Still, it was a playable game, the puzzles weren't that difficult but lacked a little cueing here and there. I did have to check a walk through at one point, but overall, I just wish the game had more interaction and a little more of a story with a background and a much better ending as I still wasn't sure the ""simulation"" was, or why I had been subjected to it. 

Don't pay more than £10/$10 for this game. It just isn't worth it.","Sep 30, 2020 at 4:44 AM",3, 11,

I got about 6 or 7 hours of gameplay out of it but I was playing it a little slower because I was really enjoying feeling like I was really there.

2022-05-28 12:38:40.464831,Pan_Daemonium,A superb little mystery game,"I just finished this game and honestly, I loved it. The atmosphere was amazing, a lot of detail has gone into telling this story well, and into the art which is really pretty. I loved the fact that you had to translate everything and look for clues to solve the puzzles, and I have to say the puzzles were aimed really well: Not completely obvious, but not head-scratchingly impossible either. As a sci-fi universe, it's easy to get into (the ""cold war"" vibe helps to cut out a lot of unnecessary exposition). There are no real NPCs in this game, or enemies to shoot, so if you're looking for that, try Half-Life: Alyx etc. This game is for puzzlers.

The controls are nice and intuitive too, and you can wander in the game but it won't let you get too lost, which is a bonus when you're not just instantly teleporting places. The use of thrusters to move, with continuous movement instead of instant teleporting, did take a while to get used to, but I did adjust to it after a while, and I actually think that's a useful experience for a VR player as well. 

(Tips for motion sickness: a) Try imagining that you really are floating around: Face in the direction of travel as much as possible, bend your knees when you touch earth after a jump etc, and if you move slowly, the effects are a lot less; and b) repeat: do not thrust yourself backwards while standing or you might fall over as I nearly did, it's a lot more disorienting than you expect X) )

The only complaint I have about this game is that it is shorter than I might have expected, I think there's about 3, 4 hours gameplay maximum. That said, good experiences always leave you wanting more, and I would seriously buy some sort of sequel to this if one were written; it has the potential to be part of a bigger world.

I highly recommend this as a few hours of creepy fun, to newbies or veterans of VR, who are into the 'atmospheric puzzle' genre. You won't be shooting zombies or aliens here, but it's not necessarily a relaxing game!","Aug 4, 2020 at 1:35 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 12:38:40.479792,ericvrx,Ok,"Great VR experience, the visuals are great, love the Soviet era imagery, architecture and all that.  As a puzzle game, middle of the road, not in the class of I Expect You to Die.  Very repetitive.  Turn the power on, turn something to line up with something else.  You need a code, find the picture on the wall that has three things in the room that have numbers on the bottom and boom, your code.  Or find the thing that sticks out like a sore thumb in the room and looks like something else that sticks out like a sore thumb.  The earth-satellite bit is ridiculous.  There's no indication of how exactly precise you have to be.  I had to look up the walkthrough because I thought I had it, which I did but it didn't work, and the guy in the walkthrough had to email the company because he figured it out too but didn't know how penny ante exact it had to be.  You solve the puzzle but it doesn't work because line A is everrr so slightly off of line B.  That's the fun of video games!  The people in this game have mastered intergalactic travel but they control satellites with a circus game and a gigantic earth model.  Every thing that needs to be turned only turns with both hands and sloooooowly because that's what's fun about VR.","Jul 1, 2020 at 9:10 AM",3, 8,

The puzzles were not particulary hard but did take a little thought to work through. My biggest negative was that the game is too short and did not represent particuarly good value.

Starting as a standard ""agent infiltrates enemy base"" game, over time it evolves into a psycho/mystery story that really captures the player. The puzzels are something to think about but always fair and solvable.","Apr 13, 2020 at 6:08 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 12:38:43.661354,KillerOfGiants1974,Not bad just not great either,"Bought this game based on reviews and the price point, and to be honest if I had paid more I would have been dissapointed, its not that the game is bad it is not, but its not great either, the graphics were just ok, there are far better looking VR titles out there as old as this that look better, the puzzles were again ok but got repetitive, restore power, push some buttons, move a lever or two, twiddle some dials..... next room, locamotion for me was very clumsy there did not seem to be smooth rotation only snap turn, which always seemed to leave me facing slightly in the wrong direction (played seated), there is also some very odd physics behaviour and lots of clipping, picked up a pot and stacked it onto another and they both clipped into each other and went flying of across the room !  also the puzzles were a bit buggy on occassion not triggering once solved also put my scanner through the peepy hole ! to scan the room on the otherside as I figured range would be an issue and it did not work leaving me stumped as to how to solve the problem, however the solution was correct I just did'nt need to reach inside the hole, such inconsistencies broke my immersion the scanner should have worked just the same whether my hand was through the hole or not, the safe puzzles also made no sense, brute forced them all, the biggest issue was that the game was just too short, 3 hours for me (only because of the picky scanner and hole debacle) it just felt like it ended just as it got interesting. So pick it up on sale just go to mars and look out of the window its worth it just for that, Cheers","Apr 10, 2020 at 11:45 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 12:38:43.677311,mdrejhon,Fantastically immersive game,"Well worth the game experience! This is right in the territory of the sci-fi VR recommendations I give to others, ""Get Robo Recall, Lone Echo and Red Matter""

It may be more expensive per hour than a non-VR game but AAA-quality content on the Oculus Rift is sometimes hard to find. I could have finished the game in four hours or less but I took eight hours because I was enthralled by the environment.

One suggestion to the developers (since I am a deafie) is that the subtitles could instead be displayed on the pop-up Translator Device (as an additional screen that I can also backscroll).   Looking at text on the handheld screen is better than floating subtitles -- but I am appreciative that there are subtitles in this game which is not even found in some other games (e.g. Lone Echo).  Since subtitles at least exist, there is no docked star even for an imperfect implementation of subtitles.  Everything else though, felt perfect though on a comfort/immersion perspective.

I did download and use Oculus TrayTool to force 1.6x Supersampling since that made graphics much sharper/better in Red Matter, so if any players have sufficiently powerful systems (1080 Ti Extreme or RTX 2080), they can up graphics quality via this external utility.

Oculus Store gets docked a star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does. I heard through a friend that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.

However, Five stars for Red Matter for going above-and-beyond!","Feb 2, 2020 at 6:38 AM",5, 23,

2022-05-28 12:38:46.812499,Romdryl,For puzzle lovers only.,"Normally I'm not a huge puzzle fan, it's just not my thing but this game looked great. For starters, it IS very well executed with regard to imersion, interaction and clever use of the controllers, once you get used to the movement. And the environment and graphics are great.

It can be pretty rewarding to figure out the main area puzzle, however I found that in some cases the clues were just not helpful. For example, in the habitat, trying to decipher the small abstract model and the symbols on it?! Even after being shown the matching symbols, having to finally go and watch a walk-through, they still didn't make sense at all. The small art object symbols looked NOTHING like the larger sculpture. I still don't see the visual connection. I just ended up pressing the wall object as shown in the vid. This means, I'd likely never have figured it out. Same thing with the locker containing the red pawn. The EIGHT looked so much like the ZERO that I went around and around trying the combo with a zero, which of course it didn't work. When the walk-through said it was an eight, I was like, ""Never mind.""

I get they want to make it challenging while still rewarding but I found the clues to disconnected to work for me.

2022-05-28 12:38:49.952207,Elgsdyr,Not nearly as good as expected,"Play time: 3 hours

Story: 2/5
Never really liked the story. I found it to be very clichéd and with a strong indie feel to it (in the bad way). Also the ending was very disappointing to me.

Gameplay: 3/5
Generally somewhat decent gameplay. The puzzles themselves were fairly logical in the literal sense but often didn't make much sense in the context - they often felt very much like artificial and simplistic game-designed puzzles and not like something you'd naturally encounter in the environment.

Visuals: 4/5
Generally beautiful visuals and well optimised (generally small indoor spaces probably helps a lot here). Lacks a bit of detail and polish here and there, though.

Controls: 2/5
The movement mechanics were weird and felt unnatural to me in the low-grav environment. Also the control layout and the way you interact with the environment is just weird. It works but feels clunky and unnatural.

Satisfaction: 2/5 (not recommended)
For the full price of $25 I really cannot recommend this game. I got it on offer for $15 and would still rather have spent them on something else.","Oct 9, 2019 at 3:06 AM",2, 11,

I got some horror vibes from the trailer, but its really not scary. It does get creepy at some parts, but there aren't jumpscares.

The lighting is beautiful and all the environments are so beautifully designed. The tone of this game is more ominous than outright scary, which is good news for those who scare easily. Puzzles weren't complex but were satisfying enough to piece together. Voice acting sadly wasn't the greatest but music was incredible. The story was cool, the pacing was great and there's a lot to be learnt by scanning the items around you.

2022-05-28 12:38:56.296389,Goffik,"A good, but short, experience.","I really enjoyed this game, and it's one of those that show the strengths of VR. It puts you in another world and creates an atmosphere like no monitor-based game can, and then uses it to tell a story.

The gameplay is quite straightforward, in that you explore a deserted, typically cold war-esuque style base trying to work out what happened, while solving environmental puzzles along the way. Everything looks good and the puzzles themselves are good though not particularly challenging. The story itself is interesting and has a nice twist.

My only real complaint with Red Matter is it's length. Most VR games are far too short compared to their monitor-based counterparts, but this one is short even by VR standards. I explored everywhere and didn't rush anything, yet was done in around two hours. For me a game of that length just doesn't justify the price, though thankfully I picked this one up in a sale.

So overall a very good experience, but loses a star because it is much, much to short for the (full) price tag.","Sep 16, 2019 at 11:46 PM",4, 2,

The controls are from hell. I don't understand why VR developer always have to reinvent the controls over and over.

""Free"" locomotion   is possible by pressing the grip button. And there is only one direction to go - forward!! That makes navigation nerv wrecking.

Both way to move - click and jump and smooth moving. While playing you may interact with many objects, some of them you need for completing quests, some just for fun.
If you interesting in original story, puzzles and smooth gameplay this game is for you. Some puzzles may take some time to resolve ;)
It took about 9 hours to complete the game for me, but if move fast and solve puzzles more quickly you may hit the end in 4-5 hours. But i don't advice to do that - stand still sometimes and look around - game is really nice looking and has good atmosphere and a bit creepy sometimes.
I absolutely recomend this experience for anyone who like quests. Others can find high immersive into atmosphere here and take part in interesting and original story.

First of all, thanks for your kind words about Red Matter :). Seems that you have indeed encountered a bug. We'll try to reproduce & fix this issue as fast as possible. Meanwhile the solution would be to load the entire chapter. In order to do this, go to the main menu, click on ""Load Game"", then select the slot you are playing in (probably slot #1), and then select ""Chapter 2"". This will load the chapter right after you exit the elevator. It's not ideal, because you will have to solve 2 puzzles again, but knowing the solutions to them it should not take you more than 5 minutes. We are very sorry for the inconvenience and the inmersion breaking bug. As soon as we have the fix we will release an update to prevent the possibility of future players encountering this unfortunate bug. UPDATE:The bug is already fixed :)"

Just completed it after 5 hours gameplay.  4 stars because of its short nature.. It really left me wanting more and an explanation of what just happened.  Thankfully there are some perceptive folks on forums to help explain it all.

 The graphics and audio are highly polished.  The smooth teleporting option is a new experience for me and I like it.. alot.

THERE IS A WEIRD TELEPORT BUG which shipped me onto the next chapter and took me by surprise...  Whilst in the area prior to the lab (chapter 4) the dog (real world) started barking to go out so I quickly put my VR to the floor to go and let her out... when I got back id been transported to Chapter 5 outside te quantum lab. How that happened i've no idea... I carried on only to find I really did need olgas Security code and got stuck in the lift without the code :(...  So went back to chapter 4 to start again... phew!

The gameplay is intuitive  as are the controllers which appear as cleverly devised multi gadget tools (with action icons), it's very easy to pick up how to navigate between them and use em.  The mechanics of the interactions with various objects has been well thought through and add to the the realism

For me it delivers on immersion and atmospherics if i'd paid full price id be feeling short changed on the amount of gameplay but its defo a bargain worth getting whilst discounted.

The story and subsequent mission tasks are challenging enough without leaving me hunting for online tips and if i'm stuck I don't mind the extra time it takes to explore for solutions.

I'm gonna say make sure you're fed and free from commitments when you load it for the first time coz you'll be wanting to spend quite some time there. I forgot how many times i was just going to get to the next problem before I quit.

At first the scale seems to be a little bit off.  Some objects stick out more than others. Not the end of the world but a but annoying.

Apart from that the gameplay itself is fairly interesting and keeps you going with clever little pussles that are not too easy but also not too hard.. I'm not supersampling but I can run this at High settings with my GTX 970 (including dynamic shadows etc.).

2022-05-28 12:39:18.432048,ccdeltabeta,Mind Games In Space,"The game comes across to myself as a discovery-type game, with some plot twists that fall somewhere between a spy movie and the Twilight Zone.  The ending left me thinking of what happened, and I wound up with 2 possible conclusions (with either one being valid to a point). If you are looking for complete closure, you may be disappointed, or more likely, just smarter than I, and wondering how I could be that oblivious.
Gamelength was 5+ hours, and that was because I took my sweet time, except when I was in a rush.  So that came out to just over $5/hour of gameplay.  If I had paid $15-$20 instead, I would likely be singing its praises.  Yes, I'm cheap.
The atmosphere of the game is very well presented, and is like a steady tension, wondering if a monster is going to pop out somewhere.  The environments are very well done, both inside and outside, and gave a wonderful sense of scale and scope, similiar to playing such VR-injected games as Alien: Isolation and Doom 3 BFG.  Seeing Saturn from the moon's surface was quite the treat.
The controls are sufficient, and work well to get the job done.  Locomotion movement is similiar to the game Detached.  It was a very nice touch how the game presented the touch controllers as actual tools in the game.
When I completed the game, I was hungry for more, which to myself, is a a sign that the game did its job.  Once you finish the game, unless there are some clues or messages I missed, there is really no significant reason to go back and play it again.  Now if they had a Lone Echo exploration of the moon's surface, for example, I would go back for that.
Overall, I am not disappointed with the game, but if you try to go through the game fast, you may be disappointed by the gamelength vs. cost tradeoff.","Sep 6, 2018 at 1:55 PM",4, 27,

2022-05-28 12:39:24.760405,Fwak,Exactly the game I was hoping for!,"After Lone Echo I wanted more and this fit the bill perfectly.
-Interesting story, slowly piecing together what happened on this abandoned base.
- Puzzles about the right level. Not as hard as as a proper puzzle game like Talos Principle where puzzles are the whole point of the game, but rather just enough to force you think a bit, maybe for a few minutes, sometimes more, and its a balanced part of the whole experience. Got stuck twice but both times figured it out just before giving up.
- Graphics about as good as you get in VR
- Level design/art work/architecture/overall look of the base/moon all excellent
- Personally thought the locomotion and controls were fine
- Creepy unnerving atmosphere without being flat out scary
- Perfect length for me. Took me 3 good length play sessions to get through it. That for me is perfectly enough for a good VR experience. Wouldn't expect much longer, didn't feel it was short/rushed/cut short suddenly (if anything was surprised how much longer it kept going after I'd expected it was going to finish),  but then I often don't get to the end of games, and I know I'm in the minority here.

Only improvement would be, the ending (which I did like), I kind of understand what happened, roughly, but not completely. Maybe it's meant to be a figure it out yourself type thing, maybe if I think back over everything I saw I could work it out, or maybe it could be a touch more spelled out.

By its nature there's prob not much reason to play through a 2nd time once you know what's coming and have solved the mystery and puzzles, but the first play through is a fantastic experience.

Played it over slowly, replaying some rounds multiple times just so I better understand the storyline. I've looked at everything in the game, and my twitch streams totaled nearly 7 hours (I was streaming even during the moments when I was just standing still trying to decipher what the posters say - they are in latin btw, with some letters being replaced with cyrilic or greek letters, while some being flipped upside down- and reflect on the storyline. FYI, I stream as ""prometery""). Needless to say I was enjoying my experience so much that I tried to stretch it in every possible way. I even found a few bugs and had to restart the game because of them - in the first level I managed to teleport through the locked airlock door of the unpowered airlock and couldn't get out. In the habitat I managed to look through the chessboard and it triggered the door being locked behind me - so I was trapped in that room and had to restart.
The game performs well on high graphics settings on my GeForce1050Ti (a mid-range video card) with a all shadows on (including dynamic shadows).
I was confused by the abrupt ending at first, and did replay the first level (including the breefing) to beter understand it. I also replayed from the lab level through the ending several times, specifically paying attention to what the monitors say... and right before it ends the monitors display a few important messages that I find helpfull to understand the ending.

Not sure what I can say about replayability, but the fact that I replayed several levels multiple times should tell you something! I found it similar to re-reading books - while re-reading you catch details you've missed during the first read. Same is true for this game - the ending isn't 100% clear the first time you play, but replaying the game knowing the vague ending makes you pay attention to the details that you have previously dismissed.","Jul 22, 2018 at 1:41 PM",5, 6,

The execution of this game just isn't as polished as those other titles, from the level design, to the puzzles and other things, this feels a few steps below what other similar games are offering.

It's on the shorter end of things, and not a bad ride, but I wish they did a better job with the control scheme, voice acting, and how you interact with text/reading objects. The latter felt more like a chore than an experience.

Anyway, some of the environments are very nice, and there some are solid things going for this. Worth playing, but not going out of your way to do so.","Jul 17, 2018 at 11:25 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 12:39:31.069332,Grombald,,"- Great graphics, runs smoothly on a GTX 970 with max settings
- Great setting, superb 60th sovjet style
- Good but not overwhelming gameplay
- Unnecessarily complicated input. Think you can move with the right stick smoothly? Nah, better press the grap button. Oh and grap with the trigger.
- Some parts of the location can not be visited, although they would be interesting and the story would have benefitted from them.
- Unsattisfying plot elements in the later game they would better have left out IMO and continued the story as it already went on.

Recommended for everybody who likes impressive architecture, sci fi games and can live with the absence of the great controls of Lone Echo.

2022-05-28 12:39:31.085797,whitefantom,,"I'm a huge fan of this studio's first VR game, Daedalus (for GearVR/Oculus Go), so I had high expectations for this one. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed!

The movement controls took a little getting used to (in addition to teleport, you can also use the grip buttons for smooth forward motion with snap turning on the right stick; the left stick is used to select between tool options for your left hand), but I ended up not minding them terribly, though I would have prefered standard movement with the left stick, or even the ability to remap the controls entiirely. 

I explored everything, took my time, read everything, enjoyed the atmostphere, and I ended up with a play time just under 6 hours, so it's not as long a game as I would have liked, but if you don't simply zip through from one objective to the other, you should get at least 3 or 4 hours out of it (I do think the price is a bit high for that amout of content, but that seems to be a common problem with VR games in general, not Red Matter in particular). 

Because the play time is 6 hours at best (and a couple of hours at worst), the story doesn't go into as much detail as I really wanted it to, but what's there is interesting and engaging, and the puzzles fit the narrative and the environment well. There's just enough of a creepy factor to add some interest, but don't go into this expecting an outright horror game, because it's definitely not. It's more of a sci-fi themed adventure game (in the vein of Myst or Obduction) with touch of creepiness .

So my high expectations were met pretty well with this game, which means my expectations for the next one will be even higher. Don't let me down, Vertical Robot guys!","Jun 20, 2018 at 2:05 PM",5, 14,

Basically they tried to do something novel using the left stick as a tool selector but which then forces you to have to move using the right stick and grip triggers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ --i.e. making everything cumbersome and less functional for no good reason. To fix: move the scanner tool and flashlight to the 'face buttons' (now unused), grabbing should *always* be with the 'grip triggers' and available *at all times* (instead of a mode you have to switch between), and locomotion (whether teleport and/or smooth) should *always* be with the 'left stick' (not right) or non-dominant-hand with a handedness toggle (have they never played a game with either a controller or kb/m before?).","Jun 7, 2018 at 4:20 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 12:39:31.134666,thomasnb2,Great game,"This is a quite short, but quite nice story-driven puzzle game. The puzzles aren't really challenging, but the story behind it adds up for it. The game has some quite creepy sections and moments, but there are no jump-scares, and you are never in any ""danger"". I found this nice, as I'm not the type of person that likes being scared (especially so in VR!)
This is a nice intro-game for people who are new to VR, and has some interesting mechanics that I haven't seen before. There are two types of movement, where there's a difference between short-movement and long-movement. Short movement is the traditional blink-to-location, but long-movement is (by default) an actual thrust with jetpacks. I see some people in comments didn't enjoy this, but I found it a nice and logical way to integrate movement. And, if you didn't like it, you can just change it in the settings :)
I made a walkthrough/tutorial with permission from Vertical Robot on the game, which you can find here: https://youtu.be/zzGULMdwCrQ. Here you can see that ""running"" through the game takes about an hour, but if you take the time to actually involve yourself in the story, and figuring out puzzles the first time around by yourself, it probably takes closer to 3 hours (the youtube video was not my first play-through of the game...)
I recommend this game! Worth having in your library.","Jun 2, 2018 at 7:42 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 12:39:34.223530,ZettaiNi,Disappointed,"The controls are funky, movement is horrible and the physics are wrong.

I thought I disliked telephoning but slowly floating to my desired location, my god, is that fun...  They have attempted try to give objects a sense of weight by making your in game arms move slower than you real ones... Every object seems to have vastly different gravely, for instance paper falls faster than a big barrel. Lighting is at odds with itself, ie if you point the in game torch at an already lit area you can make it darker and the environment lighting doesn't hit objects you move around(I tried to get a better look at something I was holding but found the lights not to work) 

Couldn't really get into the story I'll try it another time if they fix the above but I doubt it.

 if this was intended to be a puzzle game  there are far to few of them and what puzzles their are you could sleepwalk....of float semi weightlessly through your just far better off playing Xing the land beyond,

 if its a story game it's pretty bad you barely get a handfull of letters to read to understand these people were anything but vauge stereotypes bfore they died
 just play Lone Echo even the railshooter Archangle for that.

if it was truely trying to be a horor game um well it failed 100% flat on its  face in low gravity slow mo as due to their being no way to actually die in game you quickly learn you can litteraly rub your face in suposedly leathal space fungus with no repricussions.
