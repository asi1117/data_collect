2022-05-28 18:24:30.529473,Storm_Dragon,Amazing interactive storytelling,"If you're looking for another challenging puzzle game, move on, this isn't it. If you're looking for a beautifully-crafted yet very simple story that you can participate in and customize, I'm not sure it gets better than Luna. The experience is very immersive and calming, with just enough puzzle to make you think but not so much you start stressing.

While most of it is very linear, the ""building"" portion of the game allows you to express some creativity while piecing things together. It all comes together perfectly for a very unique storytelling experience. We will definitely be playing this again!","Feb 24, 2020 at 8:15 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:24:30.549420,RuneSR2,A unique experience not to be missed,It's a creative game like nothing you've ever seen or tried before. You more or less solve puzzles using Touch controllers. The game works flawlessly at 90 fps even forcing super-sampling 2.0 on an oc'ed GTX 1080. Try it - you won't regret it - or else there's the refund option.,"Aug 24, 2018 at 5:30 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:24:30.564380,FastLawyer,Perfect VR for young and young at heart,"It's true.  There's not a whole lot of game here.  The puzzles can be repetitive and not very challenging, especially for a hard core gamer.  You can speed run the game and if you do, you will probably not enjoy this game very much.  But this is not really a game.  It's an experience.  It's a work of art.  This is one of most beautiful VR apps/games you will come across.  You will want to share this beauty with kids, family, and friends.  This game is perfect for the non-gamer.  It's really about relaxing.  Enjoying beauty.  Exploration and experimentation.  Letting the game take you to an idyllic VR dream getaway.  Lose time.  Forget about getting to the finish line.  Enjoy the journey, enjoy the moment.  And the end credits are just magnificent as well.  I smiled a lot throughout the experience.  Nice break from the hardships at work or from the violence out in the world, or politics.  Thank you devs!","Feb 21, 2018 at 2:43 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 18:24:30.579340,esdin,Delightful and Playful,"Luna is that rare VR game that doesn't aim for wish fullfillment, but rather, brings us back to the freedom and wonder of childhood. Each of its tiny worlds are a playspace for you to place environmental building blocks, changing the sizes, colors, and shapes of trees and bushes to build your own wilderness diorama. 

Luna is a must play for folks who enjoy more intimate, slow-paced experiences, and is a great addition to anyone's Oculus library.","Oct 18, 2017 at 7:07 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 18:24:30.594300,netshaman,"A really nice experience , but too short","I was waiting for this neat piece of experience for a bunch of months and i was very delighted to play it, very zen, but it is too short, just about 2 hours of playtime, but the pro is you can replay infinitely because the levels are redesignable at ease, and it is so relaxing to play it, i had passed a very neat moment :)","Oct 19, 2017 at 8:20 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:24:33.706975,OoaliceoO,Sweet Meditative Game,"Very cute game, love it, well worth the price for a unique experience. I do not mind the repetitive elements, these fit to the meditation-like spirit.","Dec 4, 2017 at 6:58 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 18:24:33.721934,Deeperbeige,"Original style, yet short and repetitive","A beautiful setting and playful interactions throughout don't mask the limited number of puzzle types and the way they are repeated over and over with little to compel you onwards. I enjoyed my time with Luna, but I suspect many will find it poor value for money when they realise that every new level is essentially identical to the last.","Oct 23, 2017 at 1:53 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:24:33.735897,rh_galaxy,A fine story...,"but too short with too little contents, and not really a game. Not worth $15. Also low framerate in the story animations (not smooth). No gamepad support (yet) opposed to what is stated.","Oct 18, 2017 at 7:46 PM",3, 3,
