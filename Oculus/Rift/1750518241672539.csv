2022-05-28 12:49:25.541437,SlicedNugget,Latest Quest2 Update Makes It Unplayable,"I absolutely love this game and will continue to sink hours into it. However, I can't right now. Ever since the latest Oculus Quest 2 update, the ""reset view"" doesn't work. So the Red box you're supposed to stay within doesn't move, and it automatically sets itself up outside of the guardian. Hoping for a fix soon. 

Regardless of that, the core gameplay is great. It's a lot of fun but fair warning, it will get you sweating. It has multiple opponents, multiple difficulties for each opponent, different custom settings for fights, different side activities from speed bag to a dummy. It's honestly a fantastic game. My only currenty issue is that it will not work with this latest Quest 2 update, which isn't even a fault of the developers. Hoping they fix it soon.",Apr 1 at 6:42 AM,2, 22,"As you noted, the problem you're experiencing is because of an issue with Link and is not something that can be fixed in TotF. Since it sounds like you otherwise enjoy the game, please reconsider the low review score.

In case you're not aware, TotF is a Cross-Buy title on the Oculus Store, so because you purchased the game on the Rift Store you can download the game on the Quest Store for free to play natively instead of using Link. The Quest version is very similar to the PC version, and there's a beta release that's extremely close to the same beta version on PC (and has 90hz support!). To get to the beta, view TotF's store page in your Oculus phone app or on the Oculus website (while logged into your account), scroll down to the ""Additional Details"" section, click the version number, and choose the PUBLIC_BETA release channel.

Quick note, though, that the tracking is more accurate on that Quest beta version due to an Oculus SDK update, and that might make the game feel more difficult until you get used to it. The Rift version of the game (and the main Quest release) have some drift on fast punches that make your arms feel longer than they actually are."

I guess a recent oculus update caused this problem. I am using Rift-S and all I see is a black screen when run the app. Please help me to fix this issue.,Apr 19 at 8:31 PM,1, 6,"Hello! I tried the game on my Rift S today (on both LIVE and PUBLIC_BETA release channels of TotF), and it worked with no issues. You might try uninstalling and reinstalling the game, and if that doesn't work send me an email at ian@sealostinteractive.com, and I'll help troubleshoot."

And after that on the 3rd minute I hit the wall and hurt my hand. Looks like the game doesn't work with the Guardian correctly anymore.  That really sucks! Dear developer, you can tell yourself whatever you want, but it's your responsibility to make your game safe and playable for the players. My hand hurts and I'm really frustrated.",23 days ago,1, 2,"I'm sorry to hear about your hand. I'm not aware of any issues with the Guardian or play area when playing with the Rift S. I just jumped in and tested on both the main release and beta branches with a few different Guardian boundary shapes, but I was unable to find any issues with the play area placement or size. The boundary issues you're seeing other users mention are from using Link to play the PC version of the game on Quest. If you're playing natively on Rift S and the in-game red rectangle is positioned outside of your boundaries, please send me an email at ian@sealostinteractive.com so I can try to get more information about how to reproduce the issue. Thanks."

2022-05-28 12:49:28.701083,jimythedrummer,Best $10 I have ever spent!,"This game is great, it has several levels of difficulty and each one of them makes me sweat. There are also multiple warm up and training options like training dummy heavy bag, and speed bag (which is in my opinion more challenging to grasp than the real thing)  There are a few comparison videos up on youtube, compairing this game to other boxing games. I ended up buying it because the general consessus was that this game is the most realistic and the best workout. I did a tiny bit of golden gloves boxing in high school and I can say I almost feel like im actually there. (and by the end of the match im sweaty as hell and out of breath.

2022-05-28 12:49:28.730512,musashidan,Knockdowns?,"Have the opponents' toughness stats been changed? I haven't played in months, but when I used to I was knocking opponents out quite easily on normal. Now on normal it's a LOT harder. I've often hit them with 6 or 7 liver hooks and they just stand there. I was fighting the Irish guy today and it took 6 rounds to knock him out, having knocked him down 8 times in the fight. Other times in 3 round bouts, I'll have 94% of 500 damaging punches landed without knocking them down. 5 or 6 hit full force combos all landing with the blood spray, rolled eyes, grunting, and big orange 'POW' effect and........nothing. They just keep fighting. It's become very unrealistic. Even the fat sparring partner doesn't budge, whereas before I could knock him out in 30 seconds! :D

Update: today I tested it on the first opponent(after the fat sparring partner) 6x3 min rounds. 1000K of damage on him and 94% of 700 damaging shots landed. Nothing. He didn't ever even look like he was going to drop. 5/6 hit power punch combos and 6 rounds of accumulated damage.......I must have hit him in the liver 200 times at full power and he just stands there as if he's waiting for a bus! :) This really does detract from the realism. I have a lot of real life martial arts experience and used to fight full rules Muay Thai, so it just seems ridiculous that the very first opponent can take that sort of damage without even getting dropped.",Dec 16 at 7:36 PM,4, 32,
2022-05-28 12:49:28.744475,vTxpv,Fun but could be better,Its hard to knock people out sometimes but it would be extremely fun if there was multiplayer added and has true realism effects this will make the game alot more enjoyable and possibly a league to play in like competitive and casual multiplayer match making or with friends.,Jan 14 at 6:16 PM,4, 6,

Are you playing the game with a Quest over Link? If so, Link on PC doesn't fully support the Guardian and play area features needed for room scale gameplay. This has never worked properly, but Oculus/Meta made changes in v39 that completely broke this behavior. You'll need to use the native Quest version on the Quest store to play TotF, as it's the only supported and functional way to play TotF on Quest. Because you purchased TotF from the Oculus Rift Store, you also get the Oculus Quest Store version of the game for free."
2022-05-28 12:49:31.900633,YSLMixable,I want my money back.,blocking physics suck. whenever they throw a cross at you you put your hand in the way to block it from the side but their hands get all glitchy and hit you anyway and its stupid. they really need to redo the blocking physics so that you can block and counter without getting knocked out because it goes through your hand. you can feel your controllers vibrate as they do when you hit them or you block but sometimes you feel it vibrate and you still get hit no matter how good the block was,Nov 23 at 2:40 PM,1, 10,

2022-05-28 12:49:35.045361,PandethMegatera,Only Game I've Played For Months,"Been playing this game daily since December.  When I started I would be killed after just 2 rounds against the easier boxers on the easiest difficulty.   Now I fight the most difficult boxers at the hardest difficulty- and set it to a custom match with 12rounds.  This game has improved my cardio immensely and has given me a whole new appreciation for boxing as a sport. 

Recommended for anyone who uses their quest for exercise.  This game gives me the most intense workout in the least amount of time and battery usage.",Jul 28 at 7:40 AM,5, 19,

But if you've had martial arts training, it definitely helps you play better. Real-life boxing techniques work very well in the game (e.g. combos to the body make the opponent drop his guard, so you can go for that hook to the chin). 

It's also a great cardio workout. If you immerse yourself in the game, a 4-round match will have you sweating like crazy. All while having fun and unlocking new opponents. I highly recommend this title!",Jul 11 at 3:07 AM,5, 9,

2022-05-28 12:49:38.193060,Meekies,Needs updated,"This game is really good and has many pros for its minority of cons. 

However, I would like to discuss some changes that would near perfect this game. Starting off the knockdown system needs to change. Why? You may ask, well if you want to win by KO good luck, this game is based on TKO wins and a KO only happens in late rounds, unless you change some settings that make it very unbalanced for the opponent. I'd like it so it's a randomized chance and based on power and counter hits, this would make the game so much more enjoyable.

Secondly, the game needs more knockdown animations. In boxing we see boxers fall in many ways, some stumble then fall, some immediately get floored and some get sloppy and lose ability mid-fight making them an unconscious punching bag while standing. This would be satisfying so the player could get extra hits in before the AI falls.

Referee and Coach, during my hours of gameplay in this game the coach and referee just seem so plain. The coach clearly needs some voice lines to cheer you on or to give random advice. It would also be nice if he was in your corner telling you something to add to the realism. The referee should have the same introduction as every boxing fight in the real world, what I mean for those who don't know is that a referee will talk to both fighters facing each other face to face in the middle of the ring.

Finally. More opponents would be awesome or maybe a multiplayer? The AI is really cool and could do with a bit more animation/styles. Maybe the different fighters had coaches in their corners, or maybe having them sit as well which seems simple to do. Other small but big details would be adding blood on the canvas depending on AI cuts or how about a stoppage by cuts after a couple of rounds? Anyways this probably won't be noticed by the devs but, if so. PLEASE DO THIS! Your game will be so much better!

EDIT: Just found out they are coming out with a new Thrill of the fight 2 so updating this wont be on their list.",Jul 5 at 5:46 PM,4, 11,

Starting off with number one, i would totally give this game a 5 star rating if it had a multiplayer, number two is the game needs a little more dialogue becasue the coach never talks and it is a quiet game aside from the crowd cheering and number 3 would be the game needs more content as for maps and fighters because there isn't a whole lot of fighters and not very many maps which is a little disappointing considering how fun the gameplay is, the game just needs a few fixes and add ons and it will be a very great game.

My girlfriend wasn't interested, but I told her: just try. 
I must say she was scared of the fat guy at the beginning, but she started to practice on bags.
Then she wanted more and more, I told her you can start the match, don't need to be scared and you can punch him as strong as you want and with all your anger ;-) For example if I do something bad you can punch him so strong, (better than me!)
OK she said, I'll try.
She was so happy when she knocked him down WOW. OK next guy, than another one...

3. No Stupid Stamina Limit 
4. Its just a better game 
There is literally only 2 cons one doesnt even really matter 
Main and basically only con is that there isnt multiplayer other than that animations and graphics could be slightly better

In any case if you are seeing this review and are deciding between creed and thrill of the fight, thrill of the fight is definetly the way to go (even if you think you want a more arcadey game trust me thrill of the fight is better) but yes overall this game is amazing literally only 2 small problems","Jan 14, 2021 at 6:10 AM",5, 26,

The game doesn't limit you like other boxing games. I played creed rise to glory for a little but this game blows it out of the water! The best difference is, in this game, you stop hitting when YOU get tired. Not your in game character. So if you have great stamina or want to work up to it, this game will definetly get you there and will NOT hold you back. In certain difficulties, blocking the guys punch is so much fun!

possibility to practice bag, pear, ball workouts, all free without those annoying goals, just your fatigue and the result with the speed and intensity of your strokes.

The only really functional way to play on Quest right now is to play the native version (which you have access to for free since you purchased TotF on the Oculus Rift Store). It's very similar to the PC version, and there's a beta release that's even better and has 90hz support. To get to that version, view the TotF store page in your Oculus phone app or on the Oculus Quest Store website (while logged in), scroll down to the Additional Details section, click the version number, and choose the PUBLIC_BETA release channel.

Quick note, though, that the tracking is more accurate on that Quest beta version due to an Oculus SDK update, and that might make the game feel more difficult until you get used to it. The Rift version of the game (and the main Quest release) have some drift on fast punches that make your arms feel longer than they actually are."

I practice my techniques on these VR opponents and then I use it in the gym. You can practice a lot of head movement and timing drills in this game. If you're getting hit by these opponents on normal settings, your defense sucks in real life. Avoiding punches from a professional boxer is much harder, trust me. 
On normal settings, you can hit the opponent several times (even with your hardest shot) and he won't go out. You might then get dazed from the first shot they throw. People might not like this, but if you want to train for boxing, this might be the best way to go. If the CPU is getting KO'd by all my shots then I won't be getting any training in. 
I generally turn the CPU's speed and aggressiveness up, and then I turn their punching power down. This allows me to continuously practice my defense and counters as much as I want. I have seriously improved my timing, balance, and speed with this.","May 18, 2020 at 9:20 PM",5, 78,

2022-05-28 12:50:03.517716,corkus67,A Must Buy if you like boxing and.....,"This SIM/game has the ground works to turn into something great. In it's current state I would still highly recommend buying if you like boxing and a good workout. Make sure you are DR approved to workout LOL. Almost any level of fitness and boxing knowledge can play, but it will take practice to get good punches to land and your endurance up. Overall the game (really more like a SIM) is simplistic in it's structure and graphics, but challenging in game play. 

I jumped right into a fight after a few minutes on the heavy and speed bags. I fought normal level which was 3 rounds. The graphics were decent and game play was smooth, fun and talk about a workout. I really felt like I was fighting someone. The second time I played I stole my daughters form fitted hair towel to wear under my Rift-S because of how much I was sweating during the first fight. Worked great. I fought three 3 round fights in a row and it reduced the amount of sweat soaking into the foam part of the headset tremendously.  I went 2-1 all by decision.  Tip: Learn and use combination punches and pick and choose when you punch. Throwing 50 to 100 punches every round will wear you out.  There are some stats at the end of the fight, a the scorecard to review and how you did damage wise in each round.

I've read good things about this developer and I really hope he continues work on this game. So what could make this better: 
*Ability to create a profile and store stats.  Fights, Wins, Losses, KO's, Rank etc
*More AI boxers with different fight styles
*A 10-15 fighter ranking system to fight up to Champion then defend title fights. 
*PVP (with separate rankings and stats)

I've read some people want a story mode and other complicated stuff, but this isn't an EA game with their funding and pricey development team.  

In conclussion: at $9.99 you cannot currently buy a better SIM that let's you step into the ring and box it out to the peak of your endrance level. A must buy VR game.","Jun 13, 2020 at 12:17 AM",5, 15,

I don't have enough space for roomscale but even in front facing mode, it's extremely fun. In fact, I'd be willing to argue that front facing is a bit more intensive since you have to consistently deal with in fighting and stay in your opponents reach(you can step back but Ai will follow to 
 keep you in their range). At $10 this game is a complete steal.  I'm in what i thought to be pretty good shape, but two three round bouts in and i was beyond gassed.  Game scales too, so the first couple of fights aren't bad, but as you get higher opponents bob and weave, move when hit, and counter punch sometimes really effectively.  As long as you've got a solid 3x3 area where you can fight without punching a wall or something, you can play this game and have a blast.  Finishing a workout with this at the end, is a great way to exhaust yourself (rounds also increase as you go higher) and build stamina as well as some hand speed, timing and balance. Great job by the Dev and i wish my Oculus wasn't having the freezing/black screen issue so i could play more(Ignore time played, reinstalling oculus and games changes that).","Jul 3, 2020 at 12:00 AM",5, 2,

Negatives: 
- AI doesn't ever take a step back, even when severly hit; would make things more realistic, since not all boxing matches are 10min non-stop-bralws 
- Multiplayer would be incredible, but, for its asking price, there's no better value for money. 

Highly recommend, wish I'd bought it sooner.","Jul 2, 2020 at 12:55 AM",5, 1,"Thanks for your review! I just wanted to mention that the AI will step back, but they won't do so if it would make them leave your play area. They also won't circle you so that you don't get your headset cord tangled. This means that if you back them into a corner of your play area, they can't escape, and so then they get a little more aggressive to try to back you off. You'll need to give them some space to avoid the nonstop brawl situation."

This game has great emphasis on what boxing is about: throwing punches, landing punches, and defending against them.  Damage is based on intensity of the hit and where those hits are landed.  There are lots of different ways to train, but the best way is to simply fight AI.

The easy one was fairly easy.  Easy to counter, great way to get a feel for boxing and know where openings are when you block an attack.  It helped me break a sweat.

The normal fighter was noticeably tougher.  He landed more successful punches, whereas I was throwing a whole bunch of them that didn't land.  He was also faster and staggered me multiple times.

Devs, great work on this game.  If I were to add anything at this point, it would be a sparring partner to help you practice blocking punches, as well as learning effective combos.  Maybe later down the line, have the coach analyze your performance and critique you, like telling you that you are fighting too aggressively and try to make each punch count or something.

Will be playing this game a lot more since I don't have much else to do during sheltering-in-place.","May 4, 2020 at 1:22 PM",5, 7,

To play and win it takes sweat. To understand how to win you have to keep an eye on your opponent, parry his blows, respond with power.

I mean, literally knock him out so that the fight is over after that one knockout. I increased my power to the max and literally went through almost all the fighters and each one had a standing 8 count. No knockouts. Is it possible to get a KO without having to deal with the 2 other standing 8 counts?","Mar 3, 2020 at 12:12 PM",5, 39,"Thanks for your review. You can get KOs, but it's intentionally a bit challenging to do. In order to get them, you really have to nail one of the weak areas - the side of the chin being the most effective. It helps if you're worn the opponent down for a few rounds, too. As far as increasing the multiplier goes, when you're already hitting hard, increasing your multiplier will effectively only bring up the low-end of your punching damage, but it doesn't make your top-end hit harder. The way to make your top-end hits more effective is to lower the opponent's Toughness stat. Note, though, that doing this will also mean the opponent will generally get knocked down easier, even if it's not for the count, so it will also increase the likelihood the ref ends the match by TKO from getting 3 knockdowns in one round."

I wasn't disappointed.   I started out practicing on the bag, the dummy, the ball, etc. to get a feel for the gloves.  Then I moved on to my first opponent in a one-round sparring match.   I easily beat the guy, but i felt a tad winded, was surprised how much energy this game can take out of you.  But that was nothing compared to fighting the first opponent in the game on medium difficulty.   I was dominating the guy midway through the first round and started feeling tanked because I wasn't pacing myself.   I was doing the full Philly Shell defense, jabbing to set up gut shots and being pretty aggressive.  But again, I wasn't pacing myself.  I was wanting the end of the first round to come to an end and was gasping for air, unaware that my wife was watching me play.  She told me ""You'd better stop playing that or you're going to give yourself a heart attack"" lol.   I was starting to sweat a lot.   If you're younger, you might not get winded so quick. but you probably will sweat.  Pace yourself and drink lots of water.   It's a very well done boxing sim/game.  The graphics aren't phenomenal (if you've been playing something like Alyx) but they are still very good and especially good for a $10 game.  Lots of options to adjust things.  It's a roomscale-based game, but as long as you have roughly a 5' x 5' area, it will work.  What it does is it takes your guardian settings and puts that section down as a marked area that you're standing on in the ring.  If you don't have much physical space to move in the real world, you'll let your opponent come to you and then fight him once he gets in your box.  Hit him to back him up, or lean in to grab onto him so the ref splits you further apart.  I've got about a 6' x 6' area and it worked fine.

The doctors tell me that I shouldn't take another shot to the head anymore thus ended my career and dream. Boxing was one of the main things that I specialized in and I really do miss it. This game is pretty much the closest thing that we have right on to simulate a real boxing match. Don't get me wrong, it cannot match the actual feel of real fighting or even real boxing however it is the closest thing that we have in VR right now to it and it more than scratches that itch for me. The training feature actually measures your power and hand speed and the fighting is the most realistic that we have available to us right now. I am able to slip punches, bob and weave, shoulder rolls and practice my various other styles in the ring. Hand tracking could be better for some of my movements but that could be an issue with my headset[Oculus Quest] and not the game itself.

2022-05-28 12:50:22.618608,AverageNick484,Boxing Reborn,"You find yourself in the ring, the crowd cheering, and your opponent standing in the opposite corner ready to brawl. The adrenaline starts rushing and you get ready by doing some warm up punches. After practicing and warming up you are ready to fight. You grab the mouth peice and in a flash the fight is on. Jabs, hooks, bobbing and weaving, you start to tire after the first round forgetting to pace yourself. The first round is over and you are back in your corner, ready for more you grab your mouth peice. You begin to pace yourself, then all of a sudden WHAM! You land an enormous hit which knocks your enemy on the ground. The ref starts counting and your opponent doesnt get up. Despite the exhaustion and the chaos you hear the bells ring, the fight is over. Standing next to the ref and facing the crowd you are announced the victor, a smile appears on your face. Sweating and tired you take your headset off only to realize you are drenched in sweat. You go to bed and get a great sleep from the workout, the next day you feel sore and you go to work to be dissapointed you cant bring your headset and play more.

Rinse and repeat.

Gameplay: 10/10

Graphics: 8/10 - the crowd and settings are alright but the immersion is ruined by seeing the same 4 people in the crowd, but in the fight you dont notice.

Physics: 8/10 - my main problem with the physics is that the headset cant keep up with the fast punches. Yes its not the games fault but the experience is still effected.

2022-05-28 12:50:25.760856,FinalAppeal,What a surprise!,"Wow! This was one of those purchases I thought I might regret because the only other boxing game I had heard about was Creed, but the reviews from some MMA fighters convinced me to give it a shot. I am so happy I stumbled upon this game. There are so many things I like about this experience- I shouldn't really call it a game, because it is more like a simulation. Just as real boxing is exhausting, this game really tests your endurance, because the intensity with which you punch translates into the game. If you want to knock someone down you really have to strike hard and if you haven't managed your cardio well throughout the match, you might not have gas left in the tank to do so. However, when you do it is a great and never a cheap feeling. So there is no stamina bar like there is in most boxing games- what stamina you bring to the real world is what you bring to the game. This  workout you get from playing this is a fantastic benefit.  Your abs and core from dodging and weaving really feel it.  The graphics might not be amazing, but it is all about gameplay and they nailed it here. The physics are spot on, you never feel like your body is ""floaty"" and you never pass through the opposing boxer, like you might pass through walls or objects in some VR games.  I am adding this game to my workout routine and know this game is never coming off my hard drive. You can't beat what you get for the price.  You even have the option of hitting various training bags, like the speed bag and heavy bag if you don't want to box an opponent. These are very realistic physics wise too.","Dec 28, 2019 at 6:07 AM",5, 9,

My coach is a freak and the audience are dead-eyed clone-zombies, but my opponents show spirit and give a challenge. The battery on my right hand controller ran out in the 3rd round against whatshisface and I had to finish the fight with only my left in play, might as well as I needed to hold my side with my right anyway, still managed to score a KO at the final quarter, this felt good, very good, and the gratification of it justified the pain I felt from exhaustion. Judging from how hard this game makes me draw breath I should probably quit smoking. A carreer mode with multiple venues and weight classes, ending at the top with a thick belt on my shoulder in Vegas would allow me to give it 5/5. The price is right; I don't think you'll be disappointed. Nice one, Mr.Fitz, very nice.","Dec 10, 2019 at 12:19 AM",4, 11,

I'm no boxer or any kind of martial arts person irl so the first few times i played i went all in and then realised how fast i was completely exhausted, this game has no stamina meter, YOU last as long as YOU physically can, if you don't pace yourself you end up begging for the bell to ring so you can catch your breathe back! Fantastic workout for sure.

Warning though, if you are like me and hardly an ""active"" sportsperson irl then just be careful first few times you play, remember with vr you are swinging at thin air and if you go a bit too much too quickly you will have a couple of days of very aching and sore arms!","Dec 1, 2019 at 9:55 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 12:50:28.920030,platypusrancher,Alright for cardio,"If you aren't excercising regularly, i'm sure this will give you quite the workout. Even still, it should get you breathing a bit heavier. What was frustrating though was the game's inability to register punching speed properly. I've been in the martial arts for many years, yet the speed of my punches were being registered as light jabs. My punches were teleporting to just short of the opponent before being delivered. Granted, it could have been the Oculus Rift's controllers unable to handle the faster motions. Secondly, dodging and weaving is the only way to avoid your opponent's punches. Blocking will unfortunately get you nowhere quick. Note that the game registers your height for the punch multiplier, so even if you're a heavy puncher, it won't do you any good unless you have the height to match. Thankfully, you're able to change the multiplier in the settings, but you will still have to deal with my first point given. Despite these shortcomings, the game is still worth the price tag.","Jan 17, 2020 at 8:31 AM",3, 1,"Thanks for your review! Hopefully I have some info that will help you enjoy the game more. First, it sounds like you're experiencing a tracking issue. I'm unsure from your review if you have the original Rift CV1 or the Rift S, but what you're describing could fit two different common issues. The first is that with very fast punches, the spring in the Touch controller's battery compartment can compress and cause the battery to lose contact, which will cause tracking to drop out momentarily. Users that have experienced this problem have fixed it by inserting a stiffer spring, using a conductive shim, or putting something in the compartment to help keep the battery in place (like shelf liner or by putting a rubber band around the battery). The other potential cause would just be for the Rift S, and can happen if your guard is tight enough that the cameras can't see the controllers well, and when you fire out a punch the system can't reacquire tracking fast enough. Regarding blocking, if any part of your fist or arms touches the opponent's fists at all (or if your fist or wrist touches their fist or wrist), it completely stops the damage from their incoming punch. The primary issue is that the game doesn't really know where your arms are, so you may think you're blocking, but the game doesn't trigger a collision. You have (invisible) in-game arms that come straight out from your gloves (as if your wrists are tightly wrapped and inflexible) to your elbows, so if you're flexing your wrists at all then your real-world forearms won't line up with your in-game forearms. The elbow to the shoulder isn't as precise, though, since the game can only guess your body position. Regarding the punch multiplier - your height reading doesn't affect your multiplier or your strength level at all. All the height scaling does is makes sure you're a height the AI can handle fighting based on the distances they're designed to stand at. The multiplier (with the automatic adjustment on) is calculated based primarily on the impact velocity of your punches, and it constantly recalculates based on the hardest punches it sees you throw. It's also important to note that the game has been optimized around boxing, and trying to bring in other martial arts might not work so well. For example, boxing punches tend to be lower velocity, higher mass punches. The game can read the velocity of the controllers, but doesn't know how much mass you're linking into the punch, so if you're mixing in high speed, low mass strikes, they will instead be seen as high speed, high mass strikes, and the automatic force adjustment system will adjust based around those devastating hits. If you were to then throw some low speed, high mass punches, they will feel weaker than they should or than they would if you were only throwing slower, high mass punches."
2022-05-28 12:50:28.936985,Premat,Amazing game!,"I really love this game! I am a professional MMA-Fighter and now during corona quarantine there is really no way to spar with anybody. This game does a good job at simulating fights. I love that you don´t have some stupid ""stamina"" already programmed into you and instead you can just push the pace for 4x3 minutes in a fight. Also I enjoy the way they made headmovement so realistic.
The only thing I have to criticize is that my punches sometimes just pass through the opponent, which I cannot really explain but I 100% know they would have hit. This especially happens with my overhand right, but it doesn´t really matter that much since it maybe happens 2-5 times in a whole fight.","Apr 20, 2020 at 7:06 PM",5, 0,"Thanks for the review! I just wanted to mention that the misses with your overhand rights might be caused by a controller tracking issue that causes the controller to drift outward away from you a bit when you throw really fast punches. In that case, your real-world hand might be going to the right spot, but the tracking is telling the game your hand is going behind the opponent's head. There is an in-game option you can try in the Settings menu called ""Drift Protection"" that was added to help with this. What it does is uses your height to estimate your body proportions and doesn't let your hand travel farther away from you than your arm length should allow. If you set it to ""Simulate Wrapped Wrists"", it gets even more strict (possibly too much, so be cautious with that one). Since it's based on your height, make sure your floor level is set correctly (and if you correct it while you're in the game, make sure to go back to the weigh-in because that's where your height gets read). I'd also love to hear more about how you're using the game, so free feel to drop me an email anytime at fyiandev@gmail.com."

The reason I only give 4 instead of 5 stars:
No storymode, not enough opponents. Sure, after you knocked out every one of them, you can begin again from beginning with higher difficulty level.... but the early opponents still lack skill. I'd appreacate a (free :P) DLC with more opponents.","Nov 18, 2019 at 9:01 PM",4, 4,

I am an active person, but you should remember that any time  you do physcial activity that is different than you are used to, you will likely be sore, regardless of your level of conditioning.

Things that could be more polished but are acceptable as an early access title are a boxing tutorial, and a trainer with training pads/gloves to teach/practice punch sequence.

Not having to hold back and actually have to cover up and dodge to not get hit badly is a new experience for me, that normally only happen with newbies (not yet fit to measure and aim their strikes) and (semi)-professionals, whose 30% hit like 100% of me if I do my lucky strike ;-).

Just did some of the trainings of the App and then fought the first three opponents. Was able to TKO the first two ones rather quickly but the third I only could knock down once and won by points. I did use the minute of rest between rounds to get the best out of me. Really need to work on my uppercuts, they usually landed on the opponent's chest, not his chin. 

I recommend this to everybody with at least the minumum space required for roomscale and at least a slight interest in Boxing.

2022-05-28 12:50:47.897336,Blackshire,100% Worth It,"I downloaded this a few weeks ago after looking for a good VR fighting game. What drew me to this was that people generally said that it's more realistic than Creed and a pretty good sim. Not only is it good, it's awesome.
I started out with weak, clumsy punches. I was gasping for air after two rounds. Ugly Joe wiped the floor with me. So I watched some boxing tutorials on youtube, praticed a few combos on the bag and dummy, and then jumped back in the next day and knocked Joe out cold. I've gotten a real sense of accomplishment over the last few weeks from learning real world boxing strategies and applying them to the game to beat the harder fighters. On top of everything else, this game is also a killer workout. You can go from struggling to battle through three, two minute rounds to punching your way through two or three, four round fights at a time pretty quickly as long as you play and practice semi-regularly. 
One addition that would be helpful is some kind of short tutorial or a little bit of advice for people who are new to the sport, that way you don't need to go outside the game to learn the basics. A practice mode where the trainer uses boxing pads would also be a really cool addition.
Overall, this is one of my favorite VR games and I would definitely reccommend it if you are at all on the fence about purchasing it. 10/10 would fight again.","Sep 6, 2019 at 8:32 AM",5, 7,

It gets the workout you need quickly and efficiently whilst having so much fun! It is probably the best VR boxing game that is on the market right now and it tops creed as it has more realistic features such as liver shots and precise punching for vunerable spots on the opponents body/head. 
I have been playing this game for 3 days straight and it has completely wrecked me. I always come out of VR drenched in sweat and satisfied that this 5-10 minute workout has trained me as much as, if not more than 20 minutes on the heavy bag. 
The price is great for the experience. 
I would like to see some more features added to the game in the future such as better AI (I can do long combinations to the body a lot more than to the head), and also the AI could also backup and use better footwork.","Oct 1, 2019 at 8:23 PM",5, 1,

This is something I've tried to be extremely up-front about in an attempt to stop people without enough space from buying the game and leaving a negative review. The very first sentence in the game's store description says you need 2m of space front-to-back and that the game has no artificial movement. The game is listed as ""Roomscale"" in the ""Additional Details"" section, which has a pop-up definition from Oculus that says you need a play area size of at least 6.5ft by 5ft. The main menu screen of the game lists both the required play area size and your current play area size as sort of a ""last chance"" warning for you to go back and request a refund if needed and if you missed the requirements in the game's description. Note also, that you can use the positioning reset to turn the game left or right if you have more space in that direction. If you feel you have a large enough play space, but things still aren't working for you, please send me an email at fyiandev@gmail.com, and I'll be happy to help you get things configured to try to get the game running as best as we can within the play space you have."

The only thing that really gets me is that the ""Critcal hits (in other words green light ups when hitting them in a spot)"" are very small and you have to be extremely accurate. I tested it out on the dummy and no matter if my gloves hit the dummy to where it covered up those main spots the light up was not there. Then i also compared it to a match up and realized those spots were probably coded in the same way since i get a ton of blue and yellow hit markers. Maybe those hit boxes were to be a bit larger or even made into sections in my opinion so that when the gloves impact/cover those spots its not to difficult to make a good hit, but not large enough to the point where its to easy. Other than that i really do enjoy the workout and all of the time you guys spent to make this game. One of the best VR games out there for sure.","Sep 9, 2019 at 12:12 PM",4, 1,

1. Make the training a bit more fun, have a combo teaching mini game like in Creed, so we dont just hit the bags and see the force meter, I will engage people more to train ;)
2. Kinda contiuning from the 1. point, have a rewards system where if you train enough you unlock certain items
3. Have a stats VIP system where you can study how you fight, where you can see where the average of your pounches land and the power and see where you get hit the most
Besides that the game is a very , very good building block, all props to the dev who did an amazing job. Hope to see this or any other features added, I can speak for myself that this game is worth way more than 10 bucks ;) so price to content and quality is a easy 5 stars ;) great job :)","Aug 8, 2019 at 3:07 AM",5, 4,

I love how you can tune every aspect of the match and computer opponent.  I like to use a Polar  H10 heart rate monitor to verify how hard am working out, and can regularly hit the orange and red high intensity regions while playing this game.  I really lose track of time and can work out much harder than I would using ordinary HIIT workouts.

You can precisely control the # of rounds, length of round, opponents offense strength and speed, defense  speed, how much stamina your opponent has, how aggressive your opponent is, and the relative strength of each different kind of punch, and a bunch of other settings.

I like to modify the settings to have a 6 round match with 3 min rounds where I can just barely knock out the opponent in the 6th round.  At first, I set the opponent to have high stamina but very slow offense and defense.  As I started to knock the opponent out faster, I speed up  the opponents offense/defense until I can just barely beat the opponent by the last round.  As I gain more stamina, I add rounds to the match.","Jul 22, 2019 at 11:10 AM",5, 7,

My brother who's military trained even admitted to how the fighting was pretty good and could see himself doing that as a cardio workout.  The best part about it is just the fact that there's no arbitrary restrictions or ""gamey"" nonsense such as a stamina meter or power hits.  Your stamina is literally your own stamina.  Other VR games should take note that sometimes people just want to have a mirror of what the real world is since they might not always have the time, money, or guts to go to a boxing gym and really learn.

He he, well, here is the thing.  This is the kind of game that is made by a boxing enthusiast back in his garage, where he has his own ring and some old equipment used by one of the late great boxers.  And some people will swear by that method.  He doesn't care about pretty or name brands, all he cares about is sweat and tears.  Trying to beat his boxers will send you to the ER faster than any other game, he he.  Creed on the other hand is a multimillion dollar high tech showcase made for hollywood that would impress even a person that was never interested in boxing a day in their life.  The boxers, the annoucers, the rings and the gyms are as life like and as real as current technology will allow, and you don't have to tear a rotator cuff to beat one or two of them.  In fact Creed has sort of a built in safety factor by having you run out of energy on the more difficult opponents.  Also there are certain things you can do in creed that you can't do anywhere else, such as when you are in a gym you can move around the gym as you run in place and expericne the feel of actual jogging.  And after you knock some one out you can actually jump down on them while they are laying there and pummel them.  However, as you see, I still give this game 5 stars, because variety is the spice of life, and to be honest, I actually play this game more than Creed, but I feel that is an absolute must that you own both.","Aug 12, 2019 at 2:30 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 12:51:00.605354,Sub7th,Early Access But lots of potential,"Definitely some hits that didn't connect for some reason, but most did.
I've been in some form of martial arts since I was about 15. TKD, Goju, Shotokan, Judo, etc. So I def know how to throw a punch.
All of my jabs and crosses land consistently but any uppers or hooks seem to still be spotty.

On the rift S if you pull your hands too close to your face the gloves glitch out, but this is a rift issue as far as I know. Unfortunately it occasionally lets a hit through. But I have this issue in Creed as well.

Overall this game was loads of fun. I really appreciate that the game didnt cap my stamina like Creed does and there weren't any amazing 1st round knock outs... yet. ;)

I do feel like my hits are underwhelming at the moment. Tried adjusting the auto force but I'm not sure I used it correctly and all of my hits were landing like mosquito bites. I'm sure with some tweaking and some further development this game will be a ton of fun.

Right now it's pretty bare bones but I already enjoy it.","Jul 20, 2019 at 1:19 AM",4, 1,"Thanks for your review! As a martial arts practitioner, you've probably noticed the AI is really easy to hit compared to a trained human. To sort of make up for this, the automatic force adjustment system sets your range of strength so that you're basically required to aim for the opponent's weak areas in order to really threaten them. This system works great for making sure new players are hitting hard enough to be competitive, but it can break down a bit for highly trained players with fast hand speeds. I recommend you first play a quick match against the sparring partner throwing at the natural intensity you want to play at, then go into the Settings menu and turn off the Automatic Force Adjustment setting. Two sliders will appear that will default to the values the game adjusted you to based on your previous match. Leave the automatic adjustment off and leave the sliders set as they are by default and go try another match. If you're still feeling too weak, go back and increase the values of those sliders until you reach the level of strength that feels natural to you. I hope that helps, and please feel free to email me at fyiandev@gmail.com if you have any questions or feedback. Thanks!"

Unfortunately, the tracking does not work optimally if you have your hands right in front of your head.

But that's a problem of tracking and not of the game.

Unlike all the other boxing games this actually registers speed and power of your punches. The computer opponents also seem to use real skill to cover up and find openings in your defense.

I've had people that actively participate in combat sports tell me something was wrong, go grab a recording of themself to show me what they're doing in the real-world that's not translating over, and then say ""nevermind"" because they weren't doing what they thought they were and had let their form slip. I agree with the need for a tutorial, but I'm a solo dev with limited resources and haven't found a good simple way to tackle it within my means.

The colored impact effects were the solution that came from discussions with my users to try and help with this (and for those that want even more realism, you have the option to remove the color or turn them off completely). Blue hits are light hits that didn't have much of a permanent effect, red hits are highly damaging hits that likely left your opponent at least somewhat dazed, and the colors that blend in between from blue to yellow to red fall somewhere in between those two end points.

My fitbit is registering 600+ calories/hr burned, so it seems very feasible to help with weight loss and as part of an overall cardio/fitness program. 

And, its just plain fun, to boot.  

This title would easily be a bargain at twice the price and I cant really understand why it isnt more prominently featured in the Oculus store - I only found it searching the interweb for boxing titles.

The developer has a very active user forum and it appears he is constantly tweaking and improving the game, as well as personally answering questions and responding to feedback.

I wanted to drop in and mention that there actually is a way to customize your gloves and shorts. It's just me developing the game, and I'm limited in what I can achieve alone, but I was able to provide a quick (for me to add) and flexible way to do this. However, it's sort of a hidden feature and may be difficult for users to do if they're not used to working in image editing programs. Basically, in the game's files, I provide templates for the textures I use for the gloves and shorts, and I let you provide new textures that will override the defaults the game uses. This lets you customize the gloves and shorts with anything you can manage to come up with in an image editing program. To do this, you'll want to find the game's install directory in a file explorer and look in the totf_oculus_Data/StreamingAssets/CustomGear directory. You'll see the two template files as well as a readme.txt file with instructions (including how to use two different textures for the left and right gloves). If you have any questions about this, please feel free to email me at fyiandev@gmail.com and I will help out however I can. (You can also put .ogg files in the totf_oculus_Data/StreamingAssets/Music directory to play custom music!)"

I got Creed first, but the stamina component was irritating because your character gets tired while you still have energy. That was the main thing that lead me to this game and boy does this game let you get yourself tired. It's definitely not perfect, there's nothing more irritating than being exhausted and throwing a hard punch just to see the glove lag behind and do no damage, but it's good enough that  I enjoy putting in 30 min to an hour every day just to get my cardio in. Haven't touched Creed since I got this game. I do wish there was an online PVP component to this game though.

I love it when people with real-world experience can pick the game up and find that it works like they expect it should! Please shoot me an email at fyiandev@gmail.com, and I'll try to help troubleshoot the tracking issue you're having. The most common issue people report to me with the Rift is that when they throw very fast punches, the battery inside the controller can shift position and lose contact, temporarily dropping your tracking. Since you have real-world MMA experience, you're probably throwing fast enough to cause this problem. People are fixing it by adding conductive shims, adding stiffer springs, or by putting sticky shelf liner in the battery compartment to keep the battery in place."

I am in to this game.

A couple things I would like to suggest after playing this game for just a couple days are:

1: I really like the training aspect of the game. It would be cool to see more. For example, having a training partner stand in front of you with the striking mits [not sure of their technical names being a boxing newby]. If the training partner gave you verbalized tips like a real coach while training that would be a sweet bonus as well.

2: I find that it is too easy to block your opponents strikes by simply holding your hands up in ways that in reality seem like would leave you open to being hit. I find this takes away from the realism a bit. Maybe tighten up the precision needed for blocking. It also doesn't seem like body strikes/blocks are factored in very much. 

One last point. If you could see your arms that would be good. But maybe that wouldn't work?

I love how the speed and power of your punches is factored in! Really gets your heart going and gives you a taste if the intensity of a real fight.","Mar 28, 2019 at 5:38 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 12:51:25.949889,Avitar_Z,"""Physically motivating""","To the point, while this game as it stands is shy of a complete game as it's missing any story line, greater goal other than moving up to the next fighter.  That said, it still instantly draws you in, challenges you physically and spurs you on to do better next round.  Both my wife and I enjoy this game and recommend it highly.  At $10 it's quite a steal...

To the developer: Lovely game. If my wonderfully rendered coach would do more than grimmace at me in silence, like I dunno... coach me, that sir would IMHO complete this game.","Mar 18, 2019 at 11:50 AM",4, 2,

Picking the higher difficulties is effectively reducing your strength and making you weaker. You can't point box in TotF - you actually have to hurt the opponent in the eye of the judges to win by score, which is somewhat but not completely reflected in the ""damaging punches"" stat - so making yourself weaker is going to make it an extreme challenge to win. This is why I've named the higher difficulties as ""Endurance"" and ""Extreme"". ""Endurance"" should be a longer fight than playing on Normal since the opponent is more durable and ""Extreme"" is meant to be an extreme challenge where you really have to struggle to pull out a win. Please play whichever difficulty level is the most enjoyable for you, or use the customization menu to really dial in exactly what you're looking for. Don't pick the hardest difficulty just because you have prior boxing experience, because the hardest one is meant to be unreasonably unrealistic by design as a one-time challenge and not as the regular mode you would pick up and play."

I didn't realize that it was made by one person and when I did find out, it made me love the game even more. I honestly feel bad for you because I was reading some of the rude negative reviews on Steam and they can't understand what a beautiful game this is. I tried becoming a dev of my own but I couldn't because of difficulty understanding the engine I was using. I have some stuff that you might want to take a look into because it would make the game more fun. I would recommend adding an secret mode after beating everyone on all difficulties for people to play for and after you would beat that difficulty I would recommend adding in Cheats for you to use against the opponeants. Reason I say after beating the entire game is because people might use it to their advantage to cheat the game out and to beat everyone before they play this game in all it's glory! A gameplay mechanic that I seen on Youtube seems to be removed. You use to be able to hold someone and the round would end. Now the referee just says ""get off of him"" or something like that. This is a feature that I think should be added back because it mixed up the gameplay more. I think that there should be some type of Story mode added in to make the game feel more polished up and I also noticed that sometimes blocking doesn't work. But this is an early access game and it's a great one for being made by a team of one person. I wish you all the best and I hope you continue working on this game because I know in my heart that it is going to be a masterpiece once it's completely finished. :)","Jan 1, 2019 at 10:48 AM",5, 0,

The only things missing is training for dodging, and mitt work. It's still in early access, so I'm guessing it will be added eventually. Also, when fighting on the higher difficulties, scoring seems to be a bit messed up. Had an issue where I had more punches, and a slightly higher accuracy in all categories, yet still lost 8-10 in every match.

Also big pro is that developer is listening to his customers and game is updated frequently.
For VR IMHO are in games sports best, beside of racing where one have haptical experience using stearing wheel with force feedback, boxing with roomscaling is another great thing for VR. You cant feel punches but it is solved as far as it can in this game.","Oct 31, 2018 at 11:17 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 12:51:45.027624,UglyFish819,Fair game,"First I want to point out that this game has very little to do with boxing. The mechanics are not in any way realistic. Body punches do not seem to have any effect on the oponent. Openents have infinant stamina, and very litte skill is required.  The opponents dont actually move, there is no foot work needed and its more like a early 1900's bear knuckle 'to the line' fight (a theme they should have gon with given the mechanics). In the end the only thing that you need to do is a  lot of wild hooks and the ocasional uppercut to win.

Beyond that there are some bugs with the cammera, its often off center and way to close, and there is no way to adjust it in the game that I was able to see. When starting a match the opponent instantly teleports to a few inches of you swinging away, there is no delay or transition from the countdown to the actual action. This means you often start off getting hit.

Despite the fact that this has absolutly nothing to do with actual boxing (so please do not think you are skilled if you can win at this game), and has a couple of minor quirky bugs it is still fairly fun to play. It should also be noted that swinging this wild hooks and upper cuts is quite a work out.

I give this game a fair ratig, with the $10 I paid for it, but definantly not an actual representation of boxing.","Sep 21, 2018 at 11:15 PM",3, 3,"Thanks for your honest review. First and foremost, I need to point out that TotF is meant to be a room scale game where you physically move around your space within the Guardian bounds you traced out, and it has a minimum required play space size of 7' by 5' / 2m by 1.5m with 2m front-to-back providing the best results as mentioned in the store description. You can use the Oculus recenter option to rotate your space or you can use the ""In Match Turn Direction"" option in the in-game Settings menu to rotate your space only when in a bout if that will get you more room. The menu gym works best with a wider space, and the matches work best with a deeper space. The menus and bag placement are all based around providing the maximum workable space for the minimum place space size, so the bag will be angled to your left and the menu angled to your right so that you can reach both within your play area. This will let you face diagonally toward the corner of your play area and should provide more usable space. When you start a fight, you're expected to stand back in your corner with the menu in front of you, and not in the middle of your space reaching behind you. That should prevent you from starting within the opponent's reach. To further help with this, the beta version of the game currently has a couple seconds of delay before the opponent will attempt to swing, and I should have that pushed to the Oculus Store in an update soon. The AI doesn't use any footwork due to space and cable constraints, but nothing is stopping you from using footwork if you have room to do so. Opponents will move in and out your reach, but only if they have room to do so since they always stay within your play area. Body shots count for scoring purposes, but there's no opponent stamina system at the moment because the AI already tends to be too easy to take down as it is. You're correct that you can play this game and throw wild hooks and uppercuts that would get you floored in real boxing, but sadly that's how many are going to play it and expect success. I think you'll have more fun if you choose to approach the game like real boxing yourself, and most of my longer term players treat it like shadowboxing. Ideally, I'd have a more complex and capable AI and guided tutorials that demonstrated how you should be boxing and then mechanics that forced you to do it properly with no exploits, but as a lone dev with no funding I just don't have the resources to add much polish. I'd love to hear more feedback from you, and I'd be happy to give tips to help you get more out of the game, so please don't be shy to email me at fyiandev@gmail.com. Thanks!"

Firstly this is easily the best VR fighting game available, and in many ways the best implementation of VR I have seen. It's not perfect yet, but take some time to configure the game right and it becomes a natural feeling experience that's extremely rewarding to play. The game features a decent roster of opponents and environments that keep growing, as the developer gives regular content updates and is always receptive to feedback.

Secondly, the benefit of having a very intense conditioning trainer in your own home that's also fun to use cannot be overstated. Sometimes getting to the gym was a bridge too far for me - now I don't even go because I get a better workout in my living room. If you too struggle to excercise, or never liked the idea or expense of a gym in the first place, this game could literally change your life. When I first picked this game up less than 2 years ago, 3-6 rounds was a challenge. Now I box 12 rounds most days.

The devs have been super responsive and helpful. I re-purchased this game as soon as I found out it had an Oculus store version.

Here are a few of gotchas:

1) The Rift was designed for moderate workouts at best. If you think Beat Saber or BoxVR are heavy workouts you're in for a surprise :). That being said, I needed to buy a new foam insert for the Rift (VR Cover), something that could be wiped off with Lysol wipes. The basic black foam will stay gross for hours after a workout.

2) You may lose tracking, again The Motion Controllers were made for moderate workouts.  The battery inside will move if you swing too hard and will temporarily lose contact which will cause temp tracking loss. Some people have been inserting foam to try and make the battery tighter in the motion controllers.

3) If you're struggling at the beginning make sure you click ""customize"" under the fighter and reduce his speed, chin, power. Then ramp up the difficulty as you improve.

Again, this is the BEST VR workout.","Jul 21, 2018 at 3:15 AM",5, 13,

First the boxers are way to close to you, making you move completely out of your safe zone. Even with a full room to play in a person still needs to be able to find a way back to the center. Otherwise you will work your way into a wall or corner especially how you have to throw wirlwind punches from all directions. And may I remind the Devs that when inside a headset with headphones you don't have a sense of the room. Yes I know its VR but its also a game and if you use the virtual aspect against me then I will say the graphics and physics need a huge boost. This game is basically a bad attempt at making a quick dollar off the growing VR community. Since most of us are new at VR we get sucked into buying these titles and thinking that we got an awesome experience out of it. Even in the virtual realm of the game there is nothing that can give you a sense of where your at. For instance the coach is way out of reach, if you try to walk up to him you will hit a wall in reality, Your gloves go through the turnbuckles and the ropes, To start the fight you either step back and lean forward to touch the mouthpiece or once the fight begins your opponent is actually blending into your gloves because he is so close, You can't block punches or knock the other guys hands away, You can't grab or hug an opponent which means no ref breaking you up and restarting the match, no coaching, no ring girls or round cards, no bright lights, no flashing cameras, You can barely tell if you connect with a punch because the graphics and physics are so bad, No intros or music, no customizing your gloves or shorts and I could go on and on if you want to say that this is a game... As far as a workout there is no metering or real punch stats that could qualify this as a excercising platform. All in all if you want to excercise then get Box VR.","Sep 8, 2018 at 6:10 PM",4, 1,"Thanks for your honest review. There's not a good way to have a back-and-forth discussion on the Oculus Store, but if you want to email me at fyiandev@gmail.com, I'd be happy to  answer any questions you may have about the game or hear any additional feedback. I'd love to help you enjoy the game more if I can, and I'm always happy to chat with players and make changes based on their experience.

I have priced the game with this in mind, knowing I won't be able to provide the polish and content that bigger and better funded teams can.

The Thrill of the Fight was created to be a room scale boxing game where your play area acted as a miniature boxing ring that you are expected to move freely around in. I try to be very upfront about that and list it in the store description along with a minimum play area size, and I repeat it in the in-game text. The red rectangle you see on the floor in-game should be fully contained within the free space you traced out for Guardian and represents the area all of the in-game action will take place in. If it doesn't appear to be accurate then you may need to re-trace your Guardian bounds due to sensor movement. The red arrow on the floor marks the center point of that space and points in your forward direction. The coach is outside of your play area only if there's not room to squeeze him inside the play area with you. With larger play spaces, he is moved inside of your play area. You are expected to step back and reach forward to start the match while standing in your corner. Your opponent is placed immediately within your play space (and stays within it during the action) so that you don't swing outside of your safe area. If you stand in the middle of your space and reach behind you to start the match, you are placing yourself too close to the opponent when the round starts.
--
You absolutely can block punches, but the opponent intentionally tries to look for openings in and around your guard. You can hug an opponent to tie them up until the ref separates you, but that only happens if there is room for you to separate (so if you've cornered the opponent, you need to be the one to step backward).
--
You also absolutely do not have to throw wild, whirlwind punches. You can make them work, but it's more effective and far more enjoyable to throw good form boxing punches. If you crank up the difficulty and round count, you'll likely fall behind and wear yourself out trying to throw wild punches the whole time. TotF is basically a sparring or shadow-boxing simulator where you get out what you put in. I agree that the game fails to coach players, but I and the game's community are eager to help. Check out this video from a Rift user who is trying to improve his form and is documenting his progress: https://youtu.be/NZltYM-fkHI"

Getting set up was a bit tricky for me since i'm a VR novice. But once I had everything figured out I decided to practice. I started with the training dummy, speed bag, and heavy bag. I liked how it measured my stats out. Then I punched the coach. That was fun.

I tried the special opponents but couldn't figure them out. They looked cool though. 

I then tried a real fight against the training partner. draw. tried again. won on points. ok cool. first real match against ugly joe. I threw 800 punches, landed about 500. knocked him down once each round. I'm tired and sweaty now.

I'm running a gtx 960, and the game still runs great. It's very well optimised. 

I got a few criticisms though. I wish I could change settings to add a bit of distance between my opponent and me. That may be due to my limited play space, but still.

I figured since Fight Night dropped the ball years ago, it was a no brainer.  Aparently I was on my own because all I could find was low quality games with boxing gloves.
I got this game in pre-release, and all I can say is FINALLY.  After the first few bouts I found myself mentally preparing for the ring.  I feel the tension of being toe to toe with my opponent.  None of that signal-reaction nonsense.  This game does a great job of having the opponents behave like boxers.  I love the room-scale, I can actually move around - If only that chord from the headset wasn't holding me back.
Make no mistake, you will sweat, your lenses will fog up, you will need that 60 seconds between rounds to recover, and you will feel tension in that ring.  Overall this is the fun, exciting boxing experience I have been looking for.
The game is still in pre-release, but in no way do I feel I haven't gotten my money's worth.  What I hope to see in development:  a career mode where you have to fight your way through some opponents to gain rank.  Some customization, where I can choose my colors, and my look.  Some reaction from the crowd and that trainer guy who just stands there staring at me.  Maybe some skill building, a little nudge in the controller when I connect with a punch, and possibly mixed movement so I can get around the ring more.

In some ways. it's a risk putting this on the Oculus Store, as many users have only a front facing two sensor setup, and a limited play area, whereas this game is proudly roomscale only. To fully enjoy it you need enough room to be able to move about safely. This means more than just clearing furniture out of the way. The Oculus cable itself is not long enough for proper roomscale and I yanked the cord out and toppled my pc playing this a couple times when I first played it. Don't let that put you off though, this game is what true VR is meant to be about! If you don't already have one, invest in a rear sensor, and if you have the room, buy extension cables for the Rift. so you can move freely around. The game will reward you with both a fun experience, and a brutally challenging fitness session. The opponents all have personality and variety, you can customise each fighter and even fight full 12 round fights. If you want to lose weight, get in shape, eliminate stress this is the game you've been waiting for! If you are the kind of gamer who moans about having to stand up to play VR then please don't buy the game, or if you do, don't leave a negative review because the dev has made a game specifically to help people get more active. Just know what you're signing up for before commiting to purchase, a gut bustingly hard workout that will have you covered in sweat, but will change your life if you stick at it and do it a few times a week.

The computer apponents are fun to play against, not clumsy at all. The actual fights are intense and, like the other reviews stated, its quite a workout.

Room scale is an absolute dream with this game. You can move around the play space in your VR arena without really worrying about punching the walls. One of the best implementations of room scale to date. 

All in all this is a great early release title to this stage. I do hope the actual full release game will have more depth. I would enjoy a more robust training section. The sparring partner is a joke, he just stands there while you beat on him.

I would love to see a progression system, where youy start out as a rookie and work your way up to be come champion. 

Well worth the money.","Aug 1, 2018 at 10:51 PM",5, 1,"Thanks for the review! I'm glad you're enjoying the game. I wanted to reply to give full transparency - this isn't an extremely early version of the game, but instead it's fairly close to being finished. It's just me working on the game, and it's more than 2 years old at this point. I will be adding in a couple more opponents, adding a new venue or two, and making smaller polish changes (like updating the sparring partner fight), but there might not be much beyond that. The price has been set with the current scope in mind and won't increase with the full release. After that, I'll continue to work on the game and add whatever I can as long as I don't have a new project to move onto. There are a lot of features and mechanics I'd like to add or improve (like guided training and more game modes), but can't due to resource limitations, so I'm currently trying to find a partner to make a funded and fully-featured successor."

You start in a lobby where you can select different training modes (including heavy and speed bags). Lots of variety of things to do - and even though my wife and I go to the gym daily, we were sore in new places the next day after playing this. Very fun, addicting, and a crazy workout that had us gasping after each round. Must buy for any VR fitness buffs!","Jul 30, 2018 at 7:42 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 12:52:00.975230,safiya,Really Good Workout,I loved this game and have used it for a nice morning workout. It really feels like you're fighting and when you pummel with a rally of punches it really gets the blood pumping. I might need to increase the difficulty to >100% now that I've beat all the AIs.,"Jul 28, 2018 at 4:25 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 12:52:01.022105,grekb,Needs a lot of work,"The game seems to have problem with player position and the menus. It wont adjust to the players position but it demands from the player to move! Im not gonna move man from my play space, you need to learn who is the boss here and obey my commands! Also the menus pop up in your face and you need to take steps back to see it. The same happens with the opponents. Also, you cant move with the controlers, unless you move physically.  I should be able to move with the controlers if i wanted. You must give me that option.  Its nothing that cant be fixed so i expect some patches soon because right now its unplayable, but i can see real potential in this game with some work.","Jul 20, 2018 at 2:52 AM",4, 4,"Hello! I really appreciate that you still gave me 4 stars despite the problems you ran into. Your criticism is more than fair, but I do want to note that the store  description states that the game requires room scale with a minimum play space size and that there is no artificial movement, and the details section of the store reiterates that as well (only room scale marked). The opponents stay within the play space you defined during Guardian setup, so being able to have the play space size to accommodate them is definitely necessary. I understand that joystick movement would be appreciated by many, especially here on the Oculus store, but the game was born with the premise of being a room scale boxing game where your play area is the ring. I'll likely be looking into a standing mode in the future, but no one should make their current purchasing decision based on that future possibility. Thank you."

The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is becasue I don't want to ruin the ratings of a good game that I just can't open. It would be nice if I could get some help opening the app so I can play what seems to be one of my best vr games yet.,"Jul 24, 2018 at 4:58 AM",5, 2,"I'm sorry you're having this problem.
