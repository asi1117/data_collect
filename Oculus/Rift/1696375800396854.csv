2022-05-28 12:52:09.946013,jdukeOculus,Latest Update Removed Features,"Update Review: My favorite map is still missing so Im knocking a star off for that. However the custom music algorithm seems to be great now. My personal tracks make me sore the next day again. Years later i still start this game up to play a few of my own custom tracks. I cant vouch for the rest of the game however but if you want to have custom tracks this app is pretty decent.

Old:
I am having to redact my previous 5 STAR review for this game. This has been my favorite music collider game to date for its simplicity and personal track creator. 

A: You took away my FAVORITE MAP!!?? Why?? Whyy? The one with the colorful walls. That map got me into the zone every time. Now there are only 3 maps instead of 6. Idiocy.

B: Music Algorithm. You need to stop messing with this or get it right. You used to have left and right hand stance which changed the way it played. Boo! My hardest personal song (which is 10x harder than anything you have created) is now much much easier. I used to break a sweat. Now its lots of bending over and waiting for bricks to go by with a couple of swings here and there.",13 days ago,4, 0,

2022-05-28 12:52:09.975933,KiwiGav,Excellent for keeping the heartrate up,"This is my favourite VR game because you forget you're actually exercising. There are classes available for every fitness level. After playing it for more than a year, my only criticisms would be the lack of an ""add to favourites"" option, so if you find a class you like, you'd better remember the name or it's gone forever. I know that many other players have asked this already, so it's surprising the game developer still hasn't offered this option. Also, it would be good if there was a ""difficulty"" rating or a description next to each class explaining which areas it focuses on (more squats vs more punching, etc).
I sincerely hope the developer reads these critiques and offers simple solutions to make the game better. 
Otherwise, I'd gladly recommend this game as a way to stay fit as you get older or can't get around as much.",Feb 13 at 4:43 AM,4, 8,

Now you are required to sign in an email to exercise. Why? Who are you selling our info to?  They've also moved to a subscription model.  If you see old reviews praising the amount of workouts, that's not the case any more.  A lot has been cut out since 2017, and now if you want variety you have to sign up for a $10/month subscription.  Yes, not a DLC pack here and there, straight up subscription.

This is besides the fact that the game gets more bugs every update too. So many times the game will start to freeze up if you get too many combos. Some people can barely move their arms and the game gives it a max force rating. 

Used to be called Box VR where you boxed.  Now they're slowly changing to to a whole fitness app and covering up the name with FitXR.  Problem is they're not giving you BoxVR that you bought years ago.

2022-05-28 12:52:16.355003,Amoutsukasa,FitVR update.,"I've rejoined as a newbie since it's been awhile. 
Obviously people are not happy with the subscription model. The only gripe is the amount they are charging for it. If it was half the price it would be more motivating to pick up but even then that isn't enough. If I rate just based on someone who joined before the sub model I be mad, which I am but if it's a perspective of those who are going to join it's just too expensive for what little it gives.

I've never seen an update make a game worse?
The ability to go through the list is so much worse. It looks modern but what is the point when it's so much more frustrating. I love the tally of daily goal but they completely got rid of that for no reason. Just progression bar helps in this game.

Another gripe is the streaks in this game is much harder. I understand that more effort needs to be put in but if you are just joining it's frusting that you aren't streaking. Actually demotivating. The calculation is a bit punishing because maybe it was just luck that you hit hard at one point. So the way you want to streak is make sure you hit lighty from the start. Maybe add it a layer for intermediate level, make it optional higher points for it. Or don't punish the first time you don't hit as hard. The model is just a bad idea, really turns me off on playing it.

Just heading in the wrong direction. 

Positive is that you are adding dancing and HITT is coming. New things are great but if you just ruin the basics not much to go back to. Probably wait for next big patch but truely do regret buying the game with these removals and addtions.

Rift version: Has three venues to choose from.
Quest version: One venue only.

Rift version: All music tracks are listed individually in a library and you can do the pre-made workouts, or select a group of your favorite tracks and make custom playlist.
Quest version: No playlists, no individual tracks. We're stuck not only with fewer tracks than BoxVr but we have no control over them. We're stuck with what they decided was a good playlist. Some are. Many are not that great.

Rift version: When your workout is over, it gives you a screen of information telling you how many hooks, jabs, upper cuts, dodges, etc. you successfully hit. 
Quest version: You get nothing like this.

Rift version: When you hit 200 punches/dodges in a row, you get a 200 streak.
Quest version: Unless you are a very strong person, you get no streak unless you pound the orbs very, very hard. Way too hard for people who buy this to get into shape, are rehabbing, older, or want a solid workout without having to try to be Mike Tyson in his prime. It encourages poor form.

Rift version: My personal favorite: You can import your own MP3s into the music library and choose Easy, Medium, or Hard and it will generate a chart for you to hit. It's not perfect but there are tweaks to make it awesome. 
Quest version: Zero. No custom anything. 

Now mind you, I think the new version looks gorgeous. I love the color scheme of the background and the orbs but look at all the stuff (above) that was removed from the game. We got dancing. That's nice, I guess. The devs said that the new version was built from scratch which I get, but I wish their time and resources went  into rebuilding all the features that they took away before a dance expansion.","Dec 6, 2020 at 12:21 PM",5, 63,

2022-05-28 12:52:25.866886,tyruspeace,An excellent boxing workout,"It'll pump you up, wear you out, and you'll feel great. Most of the 10-20 minute workouts have a great pace to them. Some of the older tracks set an *extremely* fast pace for squats. That may be a pace that shorter, smaller people can do easily, but it just doesn't work for taller players. New tracks don't have that issue at all!

The Quest version's FitXR graphics overhaul is gorgeous! The effects for power hits really encourage you to put out some extra effort, and they feel excellent. The online play + live leaderboard is definitely a bit motivating, too.

I don't understand how scoring works and it can definitely be frustrating to have perfect power streaks while still being 50,000 points behind the leader. Perhaps speed matters? It shouldn't, at least not past the ""hard enough for a power streak"" threshold. Perhaps turning no squats on makes it easier to get high scores? It shouldn't. BUT! Just ignore that. You're here for a workout. I still find the leaderboard motivating, but play ""offline"" if you don't.

I recommend some kind of wrist brace or wrap if you really get into this, especially for hooks. The game gives you good safety recommendations for more restrained punching, but punching nothing while holding the extra weight of controllers can be rough on your wrists without a touch of extra support.","Dec 3, 2020 at 1:21 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 12:52:29.001691,Macros746,Some steps forward.....and others back,"Let me start by saying I'm a guy who loves lifting and HATES cardio.  I've tried most every 'exercise' game in VR and I think FitVR (Formerly BoxVR) is the best thing on the table.  It's fun.  It looks good.  It is usually responsive (more on that). And most of the upgrades in the new version are welcome upgrades....

Now the negatives that I HOPE will be addressed.  On the technical side, there is a recurring glitch with uppercuts and blocks.  With the uppercuts, especially after a series of uppercuts, it seems to be a frame rate issue where it decides you did make contact after it's already past you.  If you are working on a good streak, this is very frustrating.  The block is just plain hit or miss.  MANY times I've had my arms up in plenty of time only to decide that my arms weren't in position.  This was not an issue with BoxVR, so it must be with the new engine.  Finally for the tech issues, there are still FAR too many tracks where the beatmaps don't match the music.  This is just inexcusable.  I don't understand how this wasn't the first thing fixed from the old version.  

These are all aesthetic issues and opinions.  I like the futuristic studio, but would like the option to have other, more old school studios depending on my mood.  I like the idea of engaging with the virtual trainers, but their in game comments are so stupid and canned that it's impossible to take them seriously.  They rarely have any context to them.  It's pretty common for them to compliment my awesomeness just after I messed up.  
I hate, hate HATED the new streak system until I got good at it.  Now I have to say it definitely makes you hit harder consistantly....but....there should two tracks, a power track and a streak track.  Maybe different points boosts for each? Finally, it really needs an offline mode.  Something along the line of In Death where it saves locally unless it's online would be the way to go.  I love FitVR....but please clean it up.  Until then, buy it.  It's great.","Sep 28, 2020 at 12:17 AM",4, 17,

In general, this game is great for working out.  Gets the heart racing and the body moving.  I'm not a fan of exercise for exercise's sake but these sorts of VR apps make it easy and fun to get in the recommended amount of cardio.

Two things that I have noticed about the game.  First, there seems to be some disconnect between the visualization of the hit and the fact that is appears to miss quite often.  When I am punching, the sound is made indicating that I am hitting correctly and the flash 'ring' shows up as well.  However, quite often  when I see this, my streak goes to zero as though I missed completely.  I'm not sure what is going on there.  It's a small detail and ultimately doesn't affect my workout but it is a minor nuisance and a little distracting.

Second is there doesn't seem to be an 'Exit' option once the workout is done.  It was there when I first downloaded it on FitXR launch but there must have been an update that removed it.  A lot of VR apps are like this where you have to pull up the Quest Dashboard by holding the Oculus Key and then quit out of program.  Again, it's a small detail but I wonder why this option is not available.  It's a clumsy way to close a program.","Aug 12, 2020 at 9:19 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 12:52:35.330430,jBlau,Value on the decline,"So, I am updating my previous very positive review.

Originally, I posted that I loved this game; I still enjoy it, but my enthusiasm for this game has greatly declined.

First the positive:  It can be a good workout

Now the negative:  
1.  After purchasing it, they removed content, including my preferred environment.

2. The scoring system is pretty close to meaningless; it is so bad as to almost be random.  There are some days that I will get a Global #1 spot, and other days that I'm getting spots near the 50's.  Because of my play environment, I have to take down and put up my sensors frequently, so I re-calibrate my sensors every time.  I find that the scoring is based far more on the position of the sensors and where I am standing in relation to them, than anything to do with my personal game performance.

3.   The interface is lacking some critical features. (a) the ability to place your standing position and orientation where you want it; (b) the ability to rate or rank the various classes; which means I have had to start a list outside of the game about which ones are good and which ones are bad; for reasons i will describe below, my list of bad classes far surpasses the good.

4.  The multiplayer interface could use a lot of improvement 

5. The number of songs is very limited, and a great many of them are really, really terrible. 

6.  The DLC expansion packs are very much NOT worth the money.  I purchased the ""Essentials Pack"" and thought it was so terrible that I requested a refund.  The workouts were slow paced and the music was just awful (it was a mixture of slow paced low quality love songs or some kind of house music that I can only describe as the sound of a thousand geese being strangled...either way, not something I personally enjoy working out to).   So it is $10 for 4 terrible classes.

7.  Building your own playlists is cumbersome and you can't choreograph your own workouts. You are stuck with whatever the random generator makes.","Jul 1, 2020 at 10:56 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 12:52:35.345390,Defink,IRL amateur boxer playing BoxVR,"REVIEW UPDATE 01/05/2020 

They worked on the uppercuts/hooks, the system feels more accurate, I like it.
Very good workout: u begin sweating after only 10minutes.

Pros:
- Its get u sweating
- Once the pace picks up it gets into a nice flow (which is a big Pro).

Cons:
- Its basicly a boxing themed fitness game: I'd love to see a mini tutorial where they show how to give proper Jabs/Cross/Hook/Upercuts
- Uploading your own song takes very long

What would make it 5/5 for me:
You're using the boxing theme: at least give it some credit.

1) Allow us to enter values for wrist weights and use in the calorie estimation
2) Give credit for form.  Game allows you to make half-hearted punches, use wrist-breaking form, and drop your guard between sequences without any penalty that I could tell.  There should be an encouragement in the point system not to.

2022-05-28 12:52:38.483608,hellokupo,ex-mixed martial artist thoughts,"this game is going to make you sweat and I have a lot of fun playing it.  I feel like I get a pretty good cardio workout but I think some tweaks would make this a lot better.  

its current configuration has you stand static one side or another.  having a mode where it switches it up allowing you to switch sides on the fly (either prompted or un-prompted) may be nice because you should be able to lean to either side to dodge.   speaking of dodge, the squats are a little dodgy (excuse the pun) as in you have to stay down just a little longer to fully dodge.

let's talk about the base package.  the classes are good but not really that intense.  I will say that adding my own songs and switching the difficulty to hard took care of that but the beat detection is iffy sometimes.  the extreme pack is great but is only like 4 workouts (but they're great).  

someone said that some tutorials would be excellent and I agree.  in my discipline of fighting, my uppercuts are a lot tighter than conventional boxing so I have to adjust timing and where it strikes so I get full points.  speaking of which, a little tutorial explaining point values might be nice as I only recently figured out how to get higher point values consistently (in which trains of same side jabs is nearly impossible to max).  

my last comment is in regards to target height.  I'm 6'5"" and all the of strikes seem to be upper and lower (nothing at eye level).  not sure if that was intended design but for me seems like if I was actively fighting, I'd be losing a little bit of muscle memory in regards to upper shots.

I really hope there's some more expansions in this as I tend to warm up with this and sometimes go into Thrill of the Fight but if we're talking pure cardio in vr, this is going to give you a good time.","Jun 25, 2020 at 11:06 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 12:52:41.614831,Arestris,"No fix for bug, known for years","I really can't recommend this game at all.
And I'm not even speaking about the fact, that they removed contents with the new patches (as you can read in other, newer reviews).  As I bought it back than, I really liked it. Especially the fact to have custom playlists. Than, after a update, custom songs didn't work anymore (generated songs are empty, without targets). I wrote the support back then, even send them my logfile, never got a solution and stopped using BoxVR.
Found out by chance, more than a year later, it is a bug with Windows using a Language region with "","" as decimal delimeter (like Germany). Sure, this gives ways to work around this bug, but it's not very practicable to completly change your Windows region, every time you want to generate some workouts from new songs.
While they know this bug and it's reason for over a year now, it's not fixed, even in their newest updates. (And my educated guess as someone, working as developer myself, it cannot even be a complex bug, that's hard to fix).
Sorry, but for sure I don't buy any DLC from a company, that gives a sh*t about it's customers and isn't willing to fix their software. Actually I would refund this game, if I could, but I own it far to long now.

So, while the gameplay is not half bad (and a great workout), I totally can't recommend, cos the devs don't care about supporting customers and prefer publishing DLC to rip off some more money instead of fixing known bugs.","May 1, 2020 at 1:34 AM",1, 12,

One complain, and thus why only 2/5 stars, what made this game so special and unique in comparison to Beat Saber, was the ability to add you own songs, which was working fine in EA, but now whenever I choose my songs, they play, but no orbs appear to punch. I used this feature the most. If this gets fixed, i will give this game 5 out of 5 stars, because it is really one of the best games on Oculus.
EDIT: So they had the time to add two new DLCs but not fix the biggest bug in their game, that had been there since one year?

My only complaint at the moment is that there is not more of a reaction from the blocks themselves when you hit them.  Innevitably you will compare this to beat saber, which on the whole is not fair or worthwhile, they are very different games with different goals, but one thing Beat Saber does so well is have the blocks themselves make chunky debris that flies everywhere after you slice them, giving great visual feedback that makes every stroke more satisfying.  This tied with the haptics makes every slice feel amazing.
The targets here feel a bit weightless both in design aesthetic and reaction, which is funny given how visceral a feeling it is to do real boxing, hitting a bag, pads or a person.  The contrast of what you expect to what you get amplifies you dissapointment, if that makes sense.
  Dont get me wrong, it is exaclty what you think it is, which is pretty great and will definitley give you a workout, I'm just saying if the devs add more heft to the experience it would to be stellar.","Feb 26, 2020 at 6:00 AM",4, 66,

2022-05-28 12:52:47.969596,Grimravven,Totally Enjoyable - and a GREAT WORKOUT,"I find reviews easier to read in bullets so here goes:

1. I love the music. Music is very important to any experience that is repetitive like punching. The variety is awesome and you can add your own songs. I'm loving the ones already on here though so not rushing for it.

2. I love how you can choose your boxing studio, numerous awesome choices of environments. 

3. The targets require you to have good form to hit them. This is not a glitch or sync issue per some reviews. This is not beat saber. In beat saber you can hit the cubes anywhere and they break. If you want to score in this game, you need to execute the correct speed and movement to uppercut, cross, and hook. And that is how it should be- gaming is about SKILL!

4. This was choreographed by real trainers to be a workout. It is basically a HIIT workout with small breaks between songs followed by energy blasts during entire 2-3 minute songs. I remind those who complain about lack of continuous songs that this game was created to focus on body composition and fat burn 36 hours post workout vs just total calorie burn in game.

5. It's fun, and half way through you realize you are dripping with sweat and exercised without the punishment of traveling to the gym.

The variety of classes and the algorithm for converting audio files to boxing tracks are very strong features. Just wish the custom playlists were easier to use. You can only add one song at a time and you have to go through an extra menu each time. You can't just play songs you've already loaded in your playlist you have to start from the beginning of the playlist each time. It would also be great if you could just have the game running and add songs to folders for converting rather than having to put the headset on, add songs, and then take off the headset and wait.

Another boxing VR game Soundboxing has an awesome feature where you can just pull music directly from YouTube. It also gives you more points the harder you punch, which I'm not sure if this game has or not.

To clarify, the decimal separator that will successfully complete processing is this: '.'

Since this depends on your language set in your PC settings, please refer to this wiki to determine if you may be affected and if temporarily changing your language will help:

Im a 33-year old dad whos a former hockey player but in on my own judgement in terrible condition right now after being retired for years.  Ive tried about 20 different length classes from shortest to longest and it really does feel that there is maybe a minute long segment in an hour that you feel like you are actually exercising and rest of it is kind of easy cooldown stuff. Gloves get stuck to your face every now and then if you are in a proper pose with arms covering your face as you would when boxing.

Actually to tell you the truth it was PokerStars that pushed me to splash out on all the gear (still my most played game today). But after Christmas and new year eating and drinking too much yadda yadda you know the drill. I ******* hate going to the gym. I barely enjoy walking out to my car to drive to my desk job. I’ve been eating well and so forth but I knew I needed to go for a walk or something.

But, no need to go out into the real world! Oh no, I’ve had this on my wish list for a while now and when I couldn’t sleep at 4am I thought, I should do some boxing. So I downloaded it and filled out my age and weight and stuck to the recommended 60 minute daily workout. After playing the first few classes I’ve just finished my first 65 minutes and burnt 500 calories (apparently.... I’d be interested to wear my Apple Watch next time and see what that thinks). 

I’m so sweaty!! My arms ache, and I feel pretty good!! The music was good and the technique is easy to pick up. I’d recommend doing this alone, you kind of need to really get into it to get the contact right every time.

BoxVR was a great example of what VR could be - five or ten updates ago. 
I bought it, while it was still in ""early release"" and a good solid game. Since then the devs have continued to remove its best features, leaving it an empty shell:
Step one - remove three of the original themes - ones I liked when I bought it.
Step two - put them back when multiple users objected, but with elements now missing - like the geometric balls in the black tunnel.
Step three - remove the ability to use your own music - really? Who thought THAT was a good idea? Most software is trying to add that feature if it doesn't already have it.
Step four - break almost everything. Now my ""game"" sits there doing nothing.

Yes, the last update made it so that NONE of the themes actually do anything. No targets fly, no music. You can stand in the theme and look around and that's all you get. You do get sound in the lobby. whee. 
I've changed settings, I've uninstalled and re-installed and it fixes nothing. I've made a new profile. I've checked the boards, etc. If the best anyone can do is tell me to upgrade to Windows 10, I'm done. I didn't break this, they did.
At least on Steam, the purchaser of the product isn't completely boned like they are here, they can backlevel to the version from before the devs broke everything and ruined the product THAT YOU BOUGHT.

The fact I couldn't hit uppercuts was actually just because my tracking was faulty so wasn't able to keep up with the fast movements of the hands required in something like this. Now I'm able to hit uppercuts and everything else, this is a great little workout app.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this two years ago and they still haven't improved hit detection so that you're able to actually hit upper cut shots with a natural swing instead of having to shoot your arm way out in front of you artificially far. Also they appear to have removed the effects that used to happen when you made a particularly strong hit - there were streamers and stuff that would show up.

All the bugs and issues before seems to be fixed now. I'm able to work out to my own music now, which i couldn't before because it was always stuck on analyzing. Im happy that the developers didn't abandon this game. Its a great workout, alot more physical than beat saber.
One thing that this game would benefit from would be more customization options in the customize workout section. Like the ability to emphasize on crossovers, squats or what ever you choose at certain parts of the work out. And also the ability change difficulty levels during different parts of the work out. Hard Mode is good, but not as fast as i would like sometimes. Maybe an extreme difficulty but then at that level for an entire workout would be too much. Hence the ability to set different difficulty settings throughout the workout. Just a suggestion.","Aug 22, 2019 at 10:23 AM",5, 1,

This game is a regular source of cardio for me and everything from the mechanics to included music is great. The one MAJOR issue I have with this game is that between Rift and the game dev (not sure who is at fault) they just can't get the detection of the fists to be fluid enough. It seems like some updates improve and some updates take it two steps back.. The major issue I see is that when the game is on hard and at maximum speed, punches that are ON TARGET and ON TIME, end up as the WOOSH regardless. The time I see this the most is after squat/block or sometimes even block in general when at max speed. The only way I am able to defeat the issue is to hold my arms in front of my body like an ape, which... yeah that's not boxing. To the devs, I love your game, but that facet is very frustrating.","Sep 22, 2019 at 8:22 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 12:53:32.380467,CYBL4DE,Punch that music,"Quite simple game, but it works well. Exercises are fun and daily goal and graph keep bringing me back.

Pros:
- simple
- good soundtrack
- variety of exercise lenghts
- really gets you moving
- possibility to add your own music

Cons:
- lack of feedback (when you hit the target your controller vibrates, but there is no hit sound. I also miss sound or vibration feedback on miss, bad hit...)
- short tutorial does not include everything you encounter in the game.

Suggestions:
- Achievements - they would really motivate players
- some kind of workshop, where comunity could create their own themes, exercises...
- detail tutorial (maybe video guide) how to do every move properly. 
- favourite button to mark exercises I have enjoyed.

EDIT:
I added fifth star for the updates. New features as profiles and achievements are cool, tons of music and playlists and I dig mapping beats in custom songs.

2022-05-28 12:53:35.476763,SoulRFlair,Update on Oculus is Great!,"Thank you BOXVR for the official release of BOXVR - it's my go-to VR app!  The Bring it On workout by LJ is the bomb.  For those complaining of hit detection problems - you must click on re-center when you start the app.  After I figured that out I had no problems at all.  I love the new rewards at the end of the workout - my first run through the new version I was delighted with my master streak level award notice...the new environments are very nice and thanks for the new selection of workouts - so important to keep content updates coming at a reasonable interval.....

Here are some suggestions:
A persistant reminder in one of the graphic counter circles about foot position would be helpful - I forgot sometimes where I was supposed to be because I add some jump rope and boxing footwork to increase the cardio level.  EDIT: After I posted this I noticed that the foot position on the floor changes - so you really just need to look down for a foot position reminder.  I just rarely look down - too focused on what's happening in front of me!

I would pay another $10-$15 for a graphic interface to help craft my own workouts.  I often want to tweak the ones that the program interprets for me.  

I love the subtle ""miss"" sound effects when you miss a cue - how about adding a subtle ""applause"" when you accomplish a streak record or some other acheivement?  That would really be motivating and addictive!

Lastly, this is a tall order - but somebody in VR development needs to figure this out - the abillity to record yourself in VR so you can critique your form and share with others.  It could be a ghost image from an adjustable virtual internal camera.

The speed is set by a constant beat in all of the workouts and the symbols will come at you at rates of 1 per beat, 2 per beat, 3, 4, etc. They do a good job of assessing if your hand was moving in the direction of the required move but they don't care if the body can actually make the moves at the speed they require them. From fully extended arms in a double punch to fully retracted and swinging up into an uppercut, back and thrusting forward into a punch and then back and forward into a hook, all within a second.

SUGGESTION- let us add a folder where our music is stored so we don't have to surf to it every time, please don't over write on updates, I lost all converted music on the last update, total bummer.

Even with the ""no squats"" option I find myself becoming very frustrated. Why open a workout with a set of 10 squats in a game called ""VIRTUAL BOXING""? Do they QA these work outs and make common sense updates?

I also ""throw my gloves off"", all the time, or they seem to just disappear and not hit the balloons. This doesn't happen with other games and it gets very frustrating. 

Also, super confused after the last update- the calorie counter is so far different, which is right? Was the old one so broken or is it this one? 

Take away these things, add a few features like maybe let me select some favorites out of the workouts? Or set a workout to ""never use, way too many squats""? Remove squats from everything?

As someone who doesn't really like outdoorsey things but still wishes exercise could be fun, this has been a great help. Not only have I been comitting to half an hour every day, I've also been doing extra sets because I'm having too much fun to stop. Being able to import my own music is a great motivator too, as I'm not that fond of the playlist - though it's great stuff for a workout and I'm sure it's broad enough to at least appeal to most.

I've also played BeatSaber and it's certainly not as physically taxing - though there's also a clear distinction between BeatSaber being designed as a game and BoxVR as a fitness app. Maybe some extra mechanics and challenges down the line would keep people engaged long term.

All in all though, well worth the money!

A few minor issues / suggestions for future updates:

I've been having some small niggles with losing tracking at times and losing my combo points, which is probably a Rift S thing - especially when blocking.

Though being able to import my own music is terrific, it does sometimes feel like the actions aren't picking up the flow and accents of the music. I appreciate that's a difficult thing to program, though it does sort of feel like it's matching pre-written sets to the tempo rather than creating the levels actually based on the music itself. Rests in the music can sometimes have intense sets, whilst when things get spicy in the song I'm feeling the anti-climax of basic one bar punches.

Being able to tweak the prompts manually and even share sets would be amazing - as would some updates to the algorithm if possible.","Jun 21, 2019 at 6:04 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 12:53:44.984219,JackDiddley,Found The Fun,"Updated review with the new update (3 star)
Tracking issue with the Rift S apparently is not going to be addressed at all.  I was told it is due to the inside out tracking and cannot be helped.  I find that hard to believe as I own many games where you bring your hands close to your face and only one other has an issue.

Also, Survival used to be fun, now it plays the same few combos over and over, plus the speed gets amped up around 8 minutes and it gets so fast that it is in no way to the beat of the music.  I was told this was to prevent people going too long in survival.  
I used to enjoy getting in around 45 minutes to almost an hour in survival, but if the goal is to get me to play the game less... achieved.   I will barely find time to play a game that is less fun than it used to be with so many other options out there.  If it goes on sale for less than $15, snap it up, otherwise pass it by.

_____________ The Old Review___________
It took me a while to find the fun in this game.  I tried it months ago on a free play weekend and it seemed tedious, especially because I was really constantly aware that  I was working out and I didn't find it very fun.
Since then I upgraded my graphics card.  Even though my old one was higher than the listed minimum, motion wasn't smooth and I was finding that I was often not connecting no matter how hard I tried to get the timing right.  
Were I FOUND THE FUN in this game was when I started loading my own music. This makes ALL the difference.  It maps the beats pretty, playing to your own music makes it seem less like a chore... if you love music I guess.  This feature brings this game from a 3-star to a 5-star in my opinion.

In regards to the height issues that you are describing, have you tried running a reset of the sensor setup (you mentioned rift settings, though I'm unsure if you included a sensor setup within that). Also, be sure not to start a workout sitting down and then moving to a standing position as the cues use the position of the headset when a workout is beginning to calibrate what height they will spawn.

2022-05-28 12:53:51.343925,Dr_Melanoma,Great for training!,"I have worked out with this program nearly every day for 45-55 minutes for the past four months, and it has rekindled a passion for exercise with me.  I have some martial arts experience, and use the program like enhanced shadow boxing.  While the program doesn't encourage development of proper hand-technique or foot-work, it also doesn't stop you from using and improving your own technique.  My left-hand hooks have gone from pathetic to scoring near 90, using short swings with my elbows in, and I know the practise acquired in the game is responsible for this.  Using my own music keeps the game fresh, and I can keep the pace at a higher level than the built-in stuff.  I really love this program, and it's my primary form of exercise now (although I just bought a double-ended bag for the garage).  I'm a 60 year old heart-attack survivor and this game has made me feel as fit as a 20 year old.  One change I would like to see is some variety in the punch sequences called for after ducking the angled beams when using my own music.  In the regular game there are some slip-jab combinations (some with the opposite hand you would expect), but with my music all I see is bob-and-weave followed by a same-side hook.  It would also be nice if there were several angled beams comming at you in succesion so that it would force a little more defensive skill.

There isn't a whole lot of movement variety, you can expect to see the same sequence of punching over and over and duck and dodge system that maybe encourages you to lean more than it does move. If your really looking to break a sweat punching things then your money would be better spent with Creed. It just doesn't excite me or get me motivated to play.

Pros: Good, clean GUI, but that doesn't make it for me. However, lot's of people seem to enjoy it, and the pace may suit those who perhaps aren't looking to sweat into the headset quite as much as others.","May 22, 2019 at 4:19 AM",3, 0,

I've had this game for a year and it still sucks. Tracking and collision detection are frustratingly bad. Still barely any content. Don't give this company your money. Nothing but half a game and broken promises from them.


Original Review from May 2018:
When I first bought this game, I had high hopes for it. VR fitness seemed like something I could really get into. I was excited about how effective the workout was.

But then I stopped playing it, because it's mind-numbingly BORING. There is no content, there are no features, there is no customizability, there is no excitement, there are no rewards, there is no progress, there is no game.

Before paying $20 for this, consider the option of punching the air in your own home without wearing a headset.

The developers seem to push pretty frequent updates, so I will probably keep the game and hope that it improves with time.","Apr 16, 2019 at 5:22 AM",1, 2,"Hi jimmyaffatigato, we had a big update release last week.

In the past year the only updates to the game have been to the UI/visuals of the balloons (which was unnecessary, but hey at least it's not worse) and 2 or 3 new workouts.

It DESPEREATELY needs more tunes, more workouts and a user creator mode. The mode to load your own songs in is useless, it barely recognises the right tempo, has no idea about where the song changes from verse to chorus and has no idea about volume changes etc to change the type of hits. It's just bad.

A user creator mode would be much appreciated, there are other games (Ahem Beat Saber) that have mods for adding custom tunes and patterns, why can Box VR not add them too? It would make the game a 5/5

At the moment there are only about 8 different tunes, which gets soooooooooo repetetive, especially as they're all cheesey house and some hip hop. Give us some dubstep, some metal, some punk etc!

Sure the first week I loved it, and occasionally I come back, but the lack of different music (cuz the custom music thing is awful) means it completely fails in it's objective, so sorry: 2/5* (add custom creator or massively improve the custom music loader and that'll go up)","Feb 5, 2019 at 8:59 PM",2, 17,
2022-05-28 12:54:07.245959,Nixucik,Game. Changer.,"When I acquired an Oculus last month, I did not foresee myself undertaking a morning workout routine that has me boxing (usually in my boxers at that) for 40 minutes, burning 300 calories.  Whether one could actually get a practical workout from a video game has been a long time interest of mine since the NES power pad. I only became familiar with VR consoles last year and from the exercise I'd get playing melee games became interested as to whether a full-on workout routine with VR was doable. I'd sampled a few titles with mixed results until eventually hearing praise about BoxVR.  

During my first workout session my arms were exerted to the point of burning and yet the game kept me going.  By the second day I came to realize how my morning workouts made me feel akin to having swam laps.  I have since remained steadfast in maintaining it as a morning routine.   

I was in the military, did wildland firefighting, was active in Crossfit.  I actually don't like to workout and tend to lack the discipline to stick with a program.  With BoxVR I look forward to jumping into a musical thrash session first thing in the morning.  Being able to incorporate my own music is a huge plus all the more.   A month later and my arms are firmer and my metabolism has picked up despite it being the dead of winter.  Highly recommend; the future of video game workouts is finally here.","Jan 11, 2019 at 1:05 PM",5, 26,"Hi there, We're very interested in your BoxVR story and would love to talk with you more.

It has been two and a half weeks since we started this game and I have to say, it is a God send! I have never been in this good of shape since I was 19 years old (I am 32 now). We tried the typical gym several times and for us it got boring, so we quit every time. With BOXVR we feel like we are playing a videogame since we are competing to top each other's scores. I just hit 100% all notes on Super Endurance 1, which is the longest workout right now and did a couple others today. In one hour I burned 765 calories. Just two days ago I made a timelapse video to support this company on facebook and they saw it and SHARED it on their page! They are very hands on! Let this be a lesson to everyone who wants to get in shape who thinks the gym is boring, THE ANSWER IS BOXVR. This is now a part of our lives and we will continue to follow the people at FITXR for as long as they are around. We are FAR ahead of our weight loss goals. (For me I went from 219 to 209 and counting). All of my jeans fit, when before I only had one pair left that I could wear. My waist size has gone from a 38 to a 36. 

The only thing I would like to see is some more of the longer workouts (there is only one that is 38 minutes), maybe some more song variation from the professional workouts, and maybe more squats in the custom song mode. 

Also, there is SO much potential to add more variation with more mini games, or even a progression (career/story mode) where you level up/etc. This may keep goal oriented people playing to activate new stages, etc. Just some ideas, being a gamer and all.

I am honestly nit picking at this point though, since this game is already worth double the asking price.

This is a great app to get someone motivated to exercise at the cost of a single personal trainer visit. 

Recommendations:
-Somebody hacked the app or theres an error for the high scores. I was really dissapointed to see that when I finally got over a million points in survivor mode, all the high score names say HIGHSCORE, HIGHSCORE HIGHSCORE
-Change up the survivor mode music and challenge every week so new people have fair cometition
-Flip the footing in survivor mode every 5 minutes or so
-PLEASE ENCOURAGE WATER BREAKS! People new to fitness are not prone to knowing their body's H2O needs and cardiac exercise requires adequate hydration. A little pause and reminder that's easily dismissed every 10 min or so of continuous playing could be a nice option to choose from in settings defaulted on for newbs
-Allow for multi-add of music. It's annoying to pick a song, go back into the file directory, pick another song, go back into the file directory, etc... This also makes it easy to accidentally add the same song multiple time. 
-On the music side of things, allow yourselfs to make more money!! Team up with a music company and sell cheap workouts paired with music. I use pandora and spotify in my car and have two CD's of music from the 90's on my computer. I'd happily pay in-app for more workout options or to make music choices easier.

2022-05-28 12:54:10.436016,KhuriDE,Great workout game!,"Update 2019:
This is not the App I play the for longest time (a session usually takes only 20 minutes), but the one I start up to the most often! :)

After several sessions I can say that I truely enjoy this game for workouts. It works great in VR!
The given workouts work pretty well, even if the music on the longer versions often seem to be same as on the shorter once, however they're still fun and challenging.
However the ability to feed your own music for a workout makes this game truly great! The analyse works fast enough and if you have several songs in the playlist you can already start after the first is done analysing, so no long waiting around.

A bit of nitpicking however, if you play during analysation I had it happen twice that the game freezes for a second, probably when it's done analysing a song. I don't know how it works, but maybe it could be put to a second CPU if available to do these caluclations?
The calories calculation seems to be a bit wonky at the moment and seem to change between updates. Right now a 20 minute workout from the given ones stating something 400 calories gave me 400 at first, then around 120 only after one patch, then 320 after another patch. My wrist tracker says something around 350, so I guess the truth is somewhere between but it seems to be getting closer :)
I also noticed that if you just swat your hands up and down it calculates about 5x as much as if you do hard straight punches. Now I'm no expert but is that correct?
It would be awesome to have the stance change more often in custom music as well. I just had 17 minutes left stance and the remaining 5 minutes of my playlist on right. Maybe it would be possible to just switch after each song or in long pauses?
And every update seems to just delete all previous stats. Would be nice to keep them.

But aside from all that the devs seem to be working on it and patch stuff, and I am really enjoying this game. It leaves me sweat soaked every time. Workout goal achieved! :)","Feb 1, 2019 at 2:19 PM",5, 2,

Note: This is, in fact, a game (not just a workout routine). The core concept is pretty much guitar hero, only you're punching bags instead of mashing buttons.

Some minor issues worth mentioning:

* Room orientation: The game is played entirely front-facing, so there should be no need for a third sensor; however, there's no way to rotate the room if you don't start out facing the sensors. You can re-center the room, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to control where the new center goes (it just seemed to jump to a random location every time I clicked the button)

* Sweaty Headsets: If you play enough to get a significant workout your headset lining will become VERY sweaty and the lenses will fog up. (That's how you know it's working!) Obviously this is purely a hardware issue, so it's not a point against the game itself, but it's still worth mentioning, especially if you plan on sharing your headset with your friends, children, or lovers.","Feb 5, 2019 at 7:03 AM",5, 0,

The music that comes with it is fine but at this point I've heard them all so many times that they grate on my nerves. I've imported my own selection of music and that's a huge positive.

What I would like to see on the music front is the abilty to completely silence the music output and just run whatever training program I choose. That way I could listen to the streaming service of my choice while getting a workout. (it's 2019, who downloads music anymore!?)  

I think someone else mentioned better feedback when you make a successful hit, I would second that recommendation. A little buzz or punch sound would be nice. Obviously make it an option for those who find it distracting but a mode wher there is just feedback and no music could be an interesting zen experience.

Seriously, I had the wii, the kinect, kinect 2.0 - This has finally done what all others have failed at.  It immerses you into a rhythmic work out, once you take a minute to match your form up with the prompts, you get an amazing workout while being stimulated enough to ignore that beginning fatigue from being lazy.

Utilizes obstacles for mixing various squats (dodge/dip) along with boxing for intense workouts.  5 mins of punch and dodge drills and my 280lb flabby self is ready to rest.  10 mins and my personal trainer vegan fitness nut friend is ready for a break.

Will be useful at all level of health, this game is a great investment.

And it gets even better - You can also use your own MP3's as your workout music, and they have an auto beat mapping software that will map the boxing and obstacle rhythm to the beat of your music as best as it can, making workouts even more fun.  It does a pretty good job, but of course the more wild and random the melody, the worse the beat mapping will be.

The bad - the game-breaker for me is the punch timing is way off. I have to punch before the orbs get into my reach zone. If I wait until it should be, I don't get a registered hit. This is annoying when I can play beat sabre and it feels perfectly synced to what I'm doing. The angled punches are even worse... it's difficult to get any hits, even in training mode. Very very frustrating. I have no idea how more people aren't mentioning issues with this, although I've seen a few.

Before I knew it I found that was able to successfully complete my first medium level difficulty after a few days (Don’t judge me). Several weeks forward I noticed that I’m more flexible, agile and a little more spring to my step which progress from physical therapy cant compare to this kind of results after several years (I’m NOT advising or suggesting that you should skip your PT classes due to my experience and story).

Now I am working out daily for AT LEAST 45 minutes, if not an hour or more. I have changed my diet and plan to lose the weight finally! Some suggestions for improvement: I hope the developers will add more long workouts. The short ones just don't do it for me. Like I said, I'm out of shape but the only ones that really make me feel like I'm actually WORKING OUT are the ""red"" workouts which are 23+ minutes. Also, when I'm in the left stance, the dodge things that are coming at me should be tilted the other way. They are always leaning right. Where are the left ones? Also, whenever I go in to my profile, it sets me to ""male"" no matter how many times I set it to ""female"". The music selection is great, but I'd like to see more songs and more workout variety. I'd love to see more environments,  maybe even the ability to customize the environment plus I'd like customizable targets and gloves.

This game has me doing anywhere from 45 minute to about an hour and 15 minutes a day. I am already modifing my diet and starting to dance again to help with the slimming down.

Love that you can import your own music, because I couldn't work out to the base EDM and pop stuff. Even my wife has taken to it which mean I now have to share my occulus (Guess that should listed as a con lol).

My only few complaints so far are when I kicked up to medium the block icon makes it hard to read what follows when it is close. It is especially irksome when you get a combo that has multiple blocks only spced by one other type of hit  between. 

Since the Dev's seem to actually pay attention, I would suggest one QoL change. If your pre programmed workouts could have the music be changable that would be amazing.

And the second thing it would be nice to be able to exclude certain things (such as Blocks or squats) in a given set.

The music importer can be a little buggy at times and the rendering of the music into target tracks at first seems really on point, but once you get into a rythym, it leaves a little to be desired.

But those are my only real cons and they are both relatively minor.","Dec 2, 2018 at 9:06 AM",5, 5,"Hi there, We're very interested in your BoxVR story and would love to talk with you more. If you are able to contact us at support@fitxr.com that would be fantastic."

BOXVR isn't quite as intricate in the movements required in Beat Saber, but it more than makes up for it in other ways unique to BOXVR. For a start, I love the way it tracks your workout stats and calories burned. It also has a pretty decent track list already included in the game - so far I've not even felt the need to try out my own music in the game (but I certainly will at some point). 

A minor gripe is that it can sometimes start stuttering meaning you lose your multiplier bonus or even have to restart, but I'm confident such performance issues will be ironed out by the developers soon [I have a 1080Ti so it's not a hardware limitation on my side].

Crucially though, I find that BOXVR really gives me a workout on the longer and harder sessions. And the longest session option (that's included so far) is 37 minutes long! Still working up to that one... :)","Jan 2, 2019 at 4:45 AM",5, 0,

A few things need to be fixed; firstly the tutorial, after finishing it I had no idea how to properly punch or stand without hurting myself. Thankfully, google exists, but a tutorial standing next to a 3D model doing the moves with you wouldn’t go amiss. Secondly; the hit boxes on the squats are super arbitrary, so those could be better defined. As for the potential, as it is right now this feels more like a workout video than a video game, but video games have the potential for constant iterative feedback and it hurts to see the developer not use it. It seems the game has the software to auto generate hit sequences (thanks to endless mode) but it doesn’t look at my data. I usually miss the first punch after a block, but I’m really consistent at hooks, if there was a way for this game to look at patterns like that and generate levels that are unique to me this would easily be one of the best games in vr.

2022-05-28 12:54:39.025981,Vyne,Great workout,"I remember when i started this game(about a month ago) and of course started with the 5minutes workouts which killed me at the end and i had to rest for like 5 mins before i went back in again,today i`ve done the super endurance 1 which is 38 mins and i`ve done it 99%jab 99% cross 94% upper and 99% hook. Almost perfect i`d say..:D Anyway this game helped me regain my stamina i`ve lost long ago so thanks for that. I`ll keep continue as it is in my daily routine to reach the goal. :P 
I would like to see more super endurance workouts with different music setup.
Also, i would love to have some more rock music workouts as i could only find one in the whole game. Now i know that i can workout to my own mental music too  but i think its not the same as the trainer made workouts. relating to this it would be nice to have some program i can setup workouts for my music, eg: if i do a playlist with 5 or more songs i`d like to make some rest points between the songs,cos currently there is no rest between them, or make it more squaty or only hooks or uppers, i hope you know what i mean. Anyway i think this is a must have  game and everyone should do this daily. you developers deserve the 5 star :)
Edit: I forgot to ask, how does the calories counter works, cos i`m sure as hell that for the 38minutes workout i burn triple the calories than the counter said. Even if i`m only walking to work i burn like 900 kcal and this workout have much more movements. I`ll buy some smart watch or whatnot to check it out.","Nov 14, 2018 at 9:23 PM",5, 4,

to the developers, I wonder if it would be possible to dynamicaly keep a player at just below their failure point for rapid improvement. slow the game down dynamicly as they start to tire and miss more until they get their score back up continually reassessing for performance and difficulty.","Oct 21, 2018 at 12:04 PM",4, 1,"Hi gibbski, thanks for taking the time to share your review with us and thanks for sharing your idea.

However, recent updates have seen a big performance drop on my game. During fast segments of rapid movements, my framerate halves itself and makes for a very jittery experience. Slow parts it's fine.

Additionally, the game seems to have changed how the points are measured. I used to be able to consistently hit 60-80 point hits with heavy, on time hits. Now, I sometimes get only 1-5 points for one hit, then the next hit (which is with the same veracity), I get 50.  

I dropped the games graphics quality and that has helped a bit with performance, but I see no reason to do so as my computer should be more than adequate.

EDIT/UPDATE:
I have a question.. I didn't realise until now.. but like, I just did the Speed one, called Stress Therapy or something, it says it will burn 102 calories, and though I got 100% in everything, I only burned like 51 calories and I know that it counts calories upon how much the headset is moved, but how can it only burn 51, when  it promises 102 and I don't even just stand still, I stand and tip/trip a little bit back and forth the whole time... ?

____________________________________________________________________
Update: 03-10-2018

Not as much an update, as it is a question for the developers (I still stand by my previously written review btw. to any new comers).

Any news upon the idea I gave you, or are you working for anything similar? maybe other ways of working out.. I've actually just quit the gym and I decide to do a project with this, I will gain muscle an stay in shape, using only calisthenics (bodyweight, simple exercises only), running and BoxVR.. not only would it be cool, it would also open up a new world for future workout schemes and ways to look at it.","Oct 3, 2018 at 8:38 PM",4, 2,"Hey PATR1CKSOMMER,

2022-05-28 12:54:51.852131,Mrshawnmars,Best by far WORKOUT VR.,"Who needs a Bowflex when there is Box VR. This is absolutely one of the best workout apps out there.  I was actually tricked by another app claiming to be fun and a workout and my gosh the comment section was actually full of five star reviews ranging from the sweat factor to how much weight they lost so far. It was garbage. So, I held off on Box VR because it seems that devs follow trends in the VR creation process and often times taking advantadge of the fact that many of us are new to VR and even the weakest experience can feel like an awesome one because its VR. This is the exception to following the pack. It's well thought out has decent physics and a good tempo, musically and graphically plus you can use your own music that has an algorythm to it so its not just random spheres and your music in the background. It's not Rock Band by any means but it's pretty good. What made me understand the thought that they put into it was that when I first started I was missing a lot of punches at the targets and I thought the game had bad physics but when I started to make contact on the targets I soon realized that the game was forcing me to use form and extend my arms. You always hear people at the gym saying lift with your legs not your back. Well in a since thats what this game was teaching me to do. Not littrerally lifting or using my legs but instead making me use form and proper punching tech that burns calories. Its not a street fight its an exercise program, SO five big ones from me...","Sep 8, 2018 at 7:22 PM",5, 1,"Thanks Mrshawnmars for taking a chance on BoxVR, especially after being let down before elsewhere.

1. Some of the workouts became LEFT only. This is a major issue and should've been caught by whoever does QA for this. Hussle for the muscle does this in the blue space.  

2. What happened to the old colour scheme? I liked it a lot better and there needs to be a toggle option for it, you already have the art, add a toggle option. 

3. Gloves keep hitching in the game and causing missed punches, not entirely sure if this is also due to the cue system changes I saw in the other reviews but its hindering performance on two fronts, doesn't happen on other games. Consider these points 3a and 3b if applicable. I have been going at it for a while and the new cues are terrible, consider reverting. 

4. The scoring wheel on the workout list doesn't do it's job anymore and straight up shows 100% even for workouts I never even touched. 

5. What happened to the categories and scrolling? Where's the nice sorted list it was before? Add a toggle if anybody actually wanted the table of workouts without knowing what it focueses on and how many workouts are available for each. 

At its current state it's not worth the money, if/when these items get addressed it will likely go to the 4.5 stars this game deserves.","Aug 9, 2018 at 1:07 AM",2, 7,"Hi WhitebrowX, thank you for writing to us.

First patch was a few months ago when hit boxes where altered to be VERY difficult to hit.  This last patch as of 7 days ago changed the hitting queues to be crap and regressed to horrible hitboxes.

**Update 7/25/2018 - I still loathe the hitbox themes forced on everyone but at least they are playable now.  You can now see the next hits punch direction behind the current queue.  4 stars because it is playable now.   To earn the 5th star we need the legacy hit boxes selectable in settings.  New ones look like vanilla ice rejects from the 80's.

**Update 8/10/2018 - Added 5th star as the vanilla ice reject hit queues are gone and the new defualt ones seem like a happy comprimise between the two.  I would still like to see the old legacy queues but I'm happy with comprimise.","Aug 11, 2018 at 1:36 PM",5, 1,"Hi RickyRockFish, thank you for updating your review again.

I feel like I wasted my money, aside from the enjoyment I got out of the game prior to the update.

 1. I do not like the new look of the ""orbs"", but I understand that is personal preference, so I guess I can just suck it up and move on, BUT... 

2. It seems as though I am missing way more punches than I used to. It's acting like I am punching too soon, unless I extend my arm all the way out (which is very dangerous) or wait for the orb to basically be all the way to me then punch. This is a game breaker for me, and the reason I no longer enjoy the game. 

(Also, and this has been an issue the whole time, if you simply flick your wrist when the orbs come then you will get a high score, so the game does not reward proper technique.)

P.S. is there anyway to revert back to the previous version?","Aug 8, 2018 at 9:44 AM",2, 4,"Hi Jhall621, thank you for your feedback.

------------------- 
I really like BoxVR but one thing I have a little annoyance with is the hitboxes for hooks. Every other movement seems to register fine but hooks seem to be way off. Perhaps its me. Also the ability to reset the room position from within a workout would be great. A bit annoying to have to go back to the main menu to adjust that. Overall though highly recommended.","Aug 3, 2018 at 5:50 AM",5, 0,"Hi Dukeen, we're really glad to hear that you are enjoying our most recent update!"

The ""workouts"" the game does offer are really easy and somewhat boring so I highly suggest you have a robust music collection.

It seems that hitting the targets causes some kind of lag which also messes up tracking.

There is no possible way you're burning 150+ calories in a 4-5 min limpwristed boxing experience.  I didn't start sweating until the 30 minute mark.  Horrible tracking.  Horrible timing.  EXTREMELY limited gameplay.  Can only play local mp3 files, where competing products can stream from YouTube and any desktop audio source.  The artwork is attrociously bad.  Not worth the cost, and should be labeled as early access.  Most of the positive reviews are fake or they are not aware of the alternatives.  This could be made by a highschool student in Unity in a 2 week crunch.  Get this garbage off the store.  There is so much missing from this title I can't even begin to fit the list on the review.

Is there an FAQ or forum for this title anywhere?  I had a couple of quick questions.  (1) I notice that sometimes after a block, the screen flashes red again after a second or two, is there any reason for this?  (2) Sometimes there are long sequences of squat bars with gaps between them.  Are you supposed to stand up briefly between them?  I notice that if I stay squatted, that the totaliser doesn't reset to zero.  (3) Not sure if it's just me, but are some hook targets positioned lower?  Am I supposed to squat while doing those?

A couple of suggestions.  Sorry, very subjective.  (A) I like to do the workouts a few times during the day, and would like to cycle through them for variation.  Unfortunately when I return, I forget which is the last workout I've done.  Perhaps it would be useful to have some indication of the last workout that was done (or the last three) - maybe include a ""one day ago"", or something like that on the description for the last three workouts? (B) I find that I sometimes miss the stance change.  I'm not sure if there is a purpose for it, but it does tend to happen right at end of a rest.  I would suggest making the change stance notification more noticeable and putting it at the beginning or middle of the rest.

Thank you (dev) for replying previously.  Changing the volume in Home affects the volume for all my games, unfortunately.  Having the setting in-game means it's a set-once and forget.  Minor thing, but it does get a bit irritating having to lower the master volume every time I go into BoxVR (and put it back up when I finish).

--I just bought this after trying it out.  Well thought out, nice and simple.  For me, very convenient and fun way to get a few quick workouts in.
Is there any way to adjust the audio volume?  If not, I think this option should be added.

This used to be my go to workout app, an even better workout than Sprint Vector. The thing is, I could use any of 6000 songs stored on my NAS drive, however BVR no longer recognizes that drive, nor even my local hard drive. I only have the create a playlist option, but that obviously doesn't do anything since I can no longer use my own music. On top of that, I tried some of their premade workouts that list the type of music you'll hear: They're all 'house' except for one that says 'Rock,' but it is by no means rock, and it's mellow and no ducking or weaving. Without being able to access my own personal library, the app is no longer of any use to me.","May 24, 2018 at 1:43 PM",4, 1,"Hi McNabb, we're glad to hear it's all sorted out for this!

After trying it during the free weekend, I became absolutely hooked! Not only is this a great workout, it is one of the most satisfying experiences in VR. The punching feels realistic and the vibration of the controllers gives you that extra push you need to keep up. And the ability to add your own music, that's amazing!

But not consistently - then I purchased this game and it hits my value of ""fun"" and value of ""health""  - the two together!

2022-05-28 12:55:26.920766,karen.cusimano,"Liked enough to buy twice, but...","I originally bought this game on Steam, but since 99% of my VR games do not play properly there, liked BoxVR well enough to re-buy it on Oculus, and have been playing happily here ever since. This has been one of my regular games in my VR workout rotation every morning, and would frequently put in 45-60 minutes at a time with it. 

Until yesterday morning when I found that they had ""new and improved"" it over night. Yes, it's a very pretty game now, the new graphics are great, but unfortunately while it looks great, the game play has suffered. Gone are the 4 color punch options that worked so well, that even if an arrow was blocked by another target, or a wall while I was ducking, I knew what was coming based on what color it was. Now, they've switched to a 2 color/left right option, and if the arrow letting you know that it's either an uppercut or a hook is blocked by the target in front of you, you have no idea whether it's a jab or an uppercut, or a hook or a cross, until it's right on you, and by then it's usually too late. 

And consistency seems to be off now as well, I can throw a series of what used to be identical punches, and now score a 70 on one, a 12 on another and a complete miss on a third. Never used to do that. And my scores reflect it. Been doing the VR Fitness Insiders BoxVR challenge all month, and have been playing Super Endurance 1 all this week. My score before they ""new and improved"" the game: 479,932, with a ""highest streak"" of 694. Today's score: 191,517, with a ""highest streak"" of 240. :( Thank goodness today is the last day of the challenge, I can set this game aside and play something else until it isn't so frustrating to play.

2022-05-28 12:55:33.298471,rol,Works well for me,"Doing small hardly sweathy workouts in the morning every day which I expand to larger sweathy workouts occasionally I always missed an exciteing element during those trainings. Yes I can do and did cardio exercises in the evening with an App on my mobile which is fine or do a longer jump in place to a music video but it is not really driving me. I am thinking most time about how much time it will eat and have 1000 daily thoughts what else I can do.  Box VR keeps me focused all the time in a good an easy way so I am not bored or start think about 1000 other things. I tested it the free weekend and ended up buying it when I added my own workout music into it.

The best thing about it is the calorie counter. I don't really see what the other score is good for. I could do well without that.  What I would prefer instead is a capability to add and display the music video or a custom made picture/slide show in accordance with the burned calories.

What puzzles me is the power indicator for stright punshes. While the other punches hitpoints feel natural the stright punches seems to prefer punches you execute hitting from up to down instead stright or punches you execute too early to really hit it with full impact.. But then I am not a boxer and maybe do something wrong here. The Top-Down punch however which he counts as more burned calories cost me a lot less energy in execution than a proper straight punch.

While it is good for solo player the multiplayer is a joke. You do not see the oponent only the scoreing. You seem not to be able to talk. (or the other was silent can't tell) and the multiplayer is always empty. Big improvement potential here.

To close it. It is simple but has and does exactly what you need. Thanks god the oculus inside can be taken out and into the shower with you. You get really sweathy if you push it which is up to you. You can also play it softpunshie like thought the burned calorie counter will hardly increase that way. ;)","May 10, 2018 at 8:55 PM",4, 0,"Hi Rol, thank you for detailed feedback!

1) Music variety is quite limited. Haven't tried the ""use your own music"" thing yet, because it opens a file dialog and asks for an mp3 file.. seriously? is this 2010? Connect to my Spotify or something.
2) The music that does exist seems oddly un-normalized. Some songs are waay too loud in comparison to others. It's annoying because it requires me to stop the  session, adjust the volume, and come back. 
3) Some of the movements feel very unnatural. To both duck and strike at the same time is kinda unnatural (however the hooks after a slanted duck are fun!)

Original Review:

Out of the dozens of games in my library. I find myself returning to this one the most. It's simple. Borderline simplistic. It's basically ""just"" a boxing-skinned rythm-match game. But it's addicting. So, so addicting. Yeah, sure. In the beginning I struggled with hitting the targets in the right angle (I need to angle the trajectory of the punches just a tad bit forward). But once you get the hang of it. When the rythm sets in. You quickly go from streaks in the tens to the hundreds (and today I broke my first thousand). If there is one niggle, it is that the soundtrack is a bit limited. Now while I can load in my own music. The synching of the targets is completely automated. Making for very spotty feeling in the results (especially in songs that vary greatly in tempo within the track). I would so love to be able to do truly custom synched tracks. Laying down each target manually. Sparring to Rocky. Jabbing to Punch-Out. You know what I mean. This game just cries out for user-created DLC's!","May 5, 2018 at 3:28 AM",2, 2,"Hi Jmalmsten, thank you for writing to us. Your feedback is really helpful for us to know.

Combine this with a wrist weight for a heavier workout if you like. Use a heart rate monitor too. Do some abs and stretch excercises afterwards and voila, you have an excellent workout routine.

Would love more variety of tracks and more intense excercises, already completed all of them on the steam account at either 99% or 100%. Aim is to keep at it to get a higher score, but in terms of workout more variety added to change things up would be nice.

Will a spotify integration ever happen?

Also there is a bug with the scores, all showing as 9999999 or something on the oculus version. Steam scores work, so not sure whats going on here but please fix it, I like see where I stand at the end.

2022-05-28 12:55:45.998482,Cuddl3s,Really cool workout!,"It's fun to play and gets you sweating if you do it for a while. The preselected music is great, although I'd love to have a couple more music styles to choose from (at the moment there are mostly ""House"" - workouts). 
Using your own songs works quite well, although the algorithm doesn't seem to be deterministic, as the same song got me different results when I let it generate the level again. But it still creates satisfying results that are fun to play.

Suggestions:
-Restart the game with a countdown after pausing. At the moment it is really hard to hit the next beat when you just paused, as the game immediately starts again where you left off when you resume. Maybe a short 3-second timer would help you get ready for the next note. You could even lerp the song speed from slow to normal speed to make this easier. 
-Also, sometimes the song already starts when the environment isn't fully loaded yet. This resulted in moments when I started the game, it was still a bit laggy from loading the level, and the targets already appeared and were really hard to hit right.
-Make vibration strength dependant on the velocity of the punch when it connects. I think if done right, this could feel really cool, and could reward you for throwing real punches","May 3, 2018 at 12:26 AM",5, 0,"Hi Cuddl3s, thank you for all your feedback!

It doesn't offer any settings for customizing the level that comes out, aside from easy, medium, or hard difficulty, and the resulting levels seem to follow the beat, but they don't have a very good flow to them. The game also has an annoying fogging mechanic that happens when you miss a dodge that as of now you cannot disable. The height settings also cannot be adjusted in game, and appear, at least on my game, to be broken. When the game says to dodge vertically, the obstacles always go right over my head without me needing to duck, and regardless of what I recalibrate my height to outside of the game, they always seem to be much too high. If the developers were to implement some extra calibration settings, and some basic customization settings for using your own music (no dodges, only straight punches, slower or faster note speed), this game could be great, but right now it feels pretty barebones, and at times a bit buggy.","Apr 15, 2018 at 9:47 AM",3, 0,"Hi Toxicity, thank you for your feedback, this is really helpful for us! We are currently discussing how we could implement user generated content into BOXVR. We are also working to optimise our feedback effects. We use an auto-height feature which detects the users headset height when starting the work out the correct target height. Can you let us know if your Oculus home floor is calibrated perfectly with your real floor? You can check this by putting your hand controller on the real floor and see if this matches in your Oculus home. If you recalibrate your room set up, this may fix the height issues you are experiencing."

I'm truly impressed with the work done here as most VR games/apps really lack some thought into how things should work, in this specific case you can tell that somebody sat down and thought about what should or shouldn't be done.

2022-05-28 12:55:58.812660,Fwak,More fun than it looks,"I was expecting mostly workout that was also a bit fun, but its actually a fun game to play that comes with a workout. Its exactly as it looks, but more fun than expected.

The core game works very well. There are a few issues I spotted already, not deal breakers, but in case dev's are reading:
- ""Total workouts"" is always showing as 3-6 more than workouts done today (on first day)
- The 3 Endurance workouts were showing as 97% achieved, before I'd attempted any of them. When I did one and got 100%, all 3 then showed 100%
- Pretty sure first time I did the ""Stress Release"" workout it didn't record it.
- The daily goal of ""10 minutes, 242 calories"" took me about 40 mins to achieve so not sure about the link between time and calories.
- During one workout it seemd to not be counting calories, until in the last 1/4 I pressed B to pause, then continued, after which calories started counting.
- The spooky and winter levels, when you load a workout 1st time sometimes the workout seems to start before the level has loaded, so first thing I see is an object coming at me with no warning. Also music a tad out of sync. Restarting the level solves everything. Not an issue on other 2 levels. Not happened every time.
- It might make more sense after a few days data, but on day 1 no idea what the daily calories vs hours graph is meant to show. Doesnt help no axis labels. Data doesnt seem to change after workouts.

Sounds a lot but none of it detracts from the overall experience which is great! One of the best VR experiences I own now.","Apr 11, 2018 at 7:12 AM",5, 2,"Hi Fwak, thank you so much for your kind review!

Both me and my girlfriend play this game and thoroughly enjoy it the only issue we have right now is the the times score doesn't seem to be working or the Dev's have changed the scoring system because there is absolutly no way that we are going to beat the highest scores on the leader board which is very dis-heartening if it is a change in the scoring please wipe the leader board so everyone has a chance of being on top if it's a glitch in scoring please fix it we are very competetive other than that small issue we still love this game and continue to play every day.","Apr 11, 2018 at 11:48 PM",5, 3,"Hi Panther11, thank you so much for your amazing review!

Not sure why the tutorial does not play from the get-go (you have to dial it up yourself), but once I had found it, and done it, the progression was straightforward.

I can see this being something that I try and intergrate in my morning workout, it really reminds me of the stuff we did on the Xbox with the Kinect, but it is so much better. 

The punches seem pretty accurate, although I am still missing more than I would like, and it's not clear if this is me or the collision detection. More playing will no doubt tell me this.

I would recomend this title to anyone looking for a solid workout that will make you sweat, the only thing that put me off buying it was the 19.99 price tag, which I thought was a little high for this type of experince. 

A price of 9.99 would have seen my purchase much earlier. So possibly wait for the sale before you buy.","Apr 5, 2018 at 3:50 PM",4, 2,"Hi Wordsmithery, thanks for your kind review! We hope you continue to enjoy BOXVR! We'd love to hear about your progress!"

You forget you're working out and you're just having fun (I haven't been near my treadmill since buying this...) The whole 'punches not registering' thing is because you have to be fast and punch close to your body to score a hit on the uppercuts/hooks - takes a little practice.

There are a few reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. Firstly is there's not enough different music in the set workouts and it repeats on the longer workouts. (I know you can work out to your own music and I do, but the punch sequences aren't as tight as with the built in music). 

Also the different punching targets used in the novelty environments I find distracting, would be nice to have the choice to use the standard objects in all of them.

Lastly the workout stats seem random. A workout that states it burns 400 cals, in reality burns (for me at least) around 175 and that's no slacking and punching as hard and fast as possible (I'm pretty fit, 5'11 and 200lb).  Also the daily activity stats are saying I've worked out for 1.5 hours when I actually did 2 workouts totalling around 30 mins - not sure what's going on here?? I like to keep a close track of my workouts and I'm having to track what I'm actually doing on my phone instead.

2022-05-28 12:56:02.089037,flashpirate,"Lots of promise, needs lots of polish","The game's got some quirks and bugs, but I love how much there is to do, and I really got my heart going! Here are some (hopefully) simple but essential requests from an AudioShield veteran and former game dev:

* Let me center the room on where I am standing and whatever direction I'm facing. That's it. Wherever I am, put the feet below me. I spend 5 minutes messing with Oculus reset room and the in-game one to not punch a wall, and so the cable isn't crossing over my left hook.

* Adjusting sliders form 10' away is extremely hard. Give me something I can click.

* I don't know what's up with exposing the 50ms calibration, but I desperately need an in-game calibration tool. Upper cuts and side hooks miss 80% of the time even when I'm extremely focused on hitting them and the BPM is low. They should not be this hard out of the, err, box... Hitting them on-beat doesn't work, so I spend most of the game not listening to music and just trying to hit the visual object, which mostly never works.

* Or make the internal hit boxes larger or more forgiving. It seems like the hit boxes are the 3D models themselves and not e.g. spheres. The skeletons are MUCH MUCH easier to hit from all angles and I miss them way less but still too often.

* Let me turn off hooks and upper cuts until you can make them less superhuman.

* Allow me to turn calories off completely and forever. They're worthless (to me) and notoriously hard to get remotely accurate even with heartrate. My Apple Watch and Fitbits both measure over 10x the calorie burn in-game and are equally meaningless (that said, 10 minutes of play is definitely more than the 40 calories it said I burned).

* Color both upper-cuts differently like everything else.

* Let the joystick scroll the file interface. And give me a more compact view option. It's a nightmare to get through a few hundred folders.

* Let me save a playlist so I don't have to make it again.

It's a big list but hopefully helpful one to get you to 1.0!","Mar 4, 2018 at 5:35 PM",3, 4,"Hi FlashPirate, thanks for writing to us!

2022-05-28 12:56:05.211850,Klavkalash,Good Workout but still some issues,"I bought the game on week ago and did about 30 min. of workouts every day since. At first i was afraid it could cause muscle problems because of one-sided use. But that didn't happen. Instead i actually experienced, that the workouts are not just improving arm but also leg and back muscles. I'm very satisfied with the results and i think doing those workouts on a regular base is a good way to lose some weight.

Nontheless there are some bugs and things that could be improved:

- The personal stats only refresh when the game is restarted
- Once in a time i experienced performance issues with my gtx 1060 / i5 7600
- The Tutorial should be more precise and some more hints for a healthy use of the app would also be great
- The stance-change should be indicated earlier in-game

Therefore only 4 stars, but still definetly worth the money and a preview of what VR is able to change. Good bye gym!

Update: Since the last Update i can only give 3 Stars. Now i have major performance issues. Old Highscores were deleted for another point-system (really, isn't that something to think about before releasing a game, that already existed for steam VR?). Don't try to reach new high-scores...theryre either deleted or the unknown player gets 99999999 points....","Mar 29, 2018 at 1:35 AM",3, 2,"Hi Klavkalash, thanks for writing to us.

2022-05-28 12:56:08.376998,SebGBD,Cool concept,"Interesting game, quickly gets challenging.


One BIG flaw though is how ridiculously shallow the squats are, this should be modifiable in the settings, and would make the leg centered workouts actually tiring.


Update to the dev's response (very quick, that's cool!):
The game is not played through steamVR, but through Oculus, why should SteamVR's floor height influence anything then?

Update 2: Hi, Yes the floors correspond, the squat bars in the game are indeed too shallow for my taste. But then again I'm an olympic weightlifter. This is why there should be a way to manually change it, as different people have different mobility! Thanks again for the quick answers though.","Apr 2, 2018 at 5:59 PM",3, 0,"Hi Glbds, thanks for writing to us. Could you let us know if your Oculus home floor is the same as your real floor? You can check this by putting your controller on the real floor as seeing if it matches your steam home floor. If this is not calibrated, this may be why the squat bars are too shallow. If you recalibrate your set up, this would solve the squat bar issue, please let us know if this works!"
2022-05-28 12:56:08.399445,vanfanel,Great workout,"Update-3/14/2018: The recent updates seems to have improved the actual workout.  I always felt the calorie counter was way too generous.  It is now based on intensity.  The more you move and the faster you punch will increase the calorie count.  If you stand motionless and punch like a baby even the 20+ min workouts will give you a calorie count under 100.   Move like a demon and you can get it up to 300 or so.  Well done!

Thankyou for the reply and helping solve the issues. I have given you the 5 stars again :)","Mar 13, 2018 at 3:21 PM",5, 5,"Hi Snakehip5, thanks for writing to us. We have introduced an auto-height feature which automatically generates cue height from users head/HMD height at start of workout. This means both yourself and your son will be able to play at your respective heights if you start the workout with your headset on. The way our glove adjustment system is designed is so that you enter a natural hand position into the glove whilst it is stationary. To make this work please follow the next steps:
1. Click on Adjust Glove Angle 
2. Hold down the trigger 
3. Whilst the boxing glove is no longer moving, move your hand and controller into the glove as if the glove was surrounding the controller. 
4. Release the trigger. 
This should now mean the glove moves as the controller does. This should fix the issue for you. Please email us at Support@fitxr.com to let us know if this resolves your issue."

Would be great if I could get an answer from you. 

Would I really just want a little more variety, more workouts and possibly workouts where you have to jump, then there was that I think, but was removed again. 

But otherwise really great the workouts and good music, would be nice if new music would come.

2022-05-28 12:56:18.029700,caffeinewriter,What Wii Fit should've been,"I bought this game on a whim, wanting a VR boxing game for myself and a friend, but what I got was so much more. It's a rhythm game with a hell of a workout. It's beauty is partially in its simplicity. It's a bit hard to get some of the hooks and uppercuts on the boxing, because you basically have to hit _before_ the beat, which is a little bothersome in a rhythm game, but still, it is _incredibly_ fun. I played this far longer than I should've today, and I'm sweating. 

I'd love to see a multiplayer mode come to this, or at least some sort of friend leaderboard, especially for custom songs. It's still fun to hang out with your buddy/buddies in voice chat and try and outdo each other with custom songs. 

In short, I definitely recommend it, and any issues it has are dwarfed by the sheer polish and fun of the game.","Mar 4, 2018 at 5:15 PM",5, 2,"Hi Caffeinewriter, thanks for writing to us!

2022-05-28 12:56:21.188851,JRNGold7,Fun Workout! Needs some tweaking,"I really enjoy playing this game, it's been a fun workout to add to my routine. I get sweaty and sore when done right and am glad I purchased this. However, there's a few things I'd like to throw out there that would be helpful if changed or at least considered.
First, as you switch from a left to right stance the green and yellow balls change sides as well. Once I get into a groove that change sides, I keep trying to punch the ball with the previous hand. Is it possible to keep the green on one side and the yellow the other without ever switching them around. I think it causes some confusion because you get use to hitting one with the right or left hand and then it switches up.
Second, during the rest time it would be great if the board reflected if you were going to switch from left to right stance immediately instead of waiting until right before the first ball is released. That way you have time to get your stance centered instead of jumping into it right before the ball comes. Especially because some of the breaks keep you in the same stance, you just don't know when you're going to have to make the switch.
Lastly, for example, in Survivor Mode everytime you enter you always beging with a left stance. It would be great if you could either pick which side you wanted to start on or if it switched automatically everytime you entered. I'm sure I'm not the only one whose left side has been getting the most workout.

All in all, I really enjoy this game and I can't wait to see where it goes.","Feb 27, 2018 at 12:09 AM",4, 0,"Hi JRNGold7, thanks for your great review! We’re glad you are enjoying BOXVR!

I'm lowering my rating by one star for resetting my stats after the update today.

UPDATE:
Im raising my review by one star because the developer responded to my comment.  It's nice to know they are reading these and taking comments to heart. 

Game is in Beta.  Not sure why it's for sale in Beta.  I remember when publishers used to sell finished games, not imcomplete titles in beta.  Stats are inaccurate.  I played two days in a row but the stats only show for the first day.  Stats only show total time played instead of for each day.  Weight graph shows I weighed 190 yesterday and ZERO the next day.  Time played under days of the week are shown in confusing  format (i.e Fri .41)

The new update:
I know Cal counters without any vital stats are only Cal-guesses.. But after the update it gettig very strange... I've done a 45 min workout...and it showed me that I only burned 150 ccal.  cant be right..i guess

Translation:
""House""- Music in german is also ""House"" not ""Haus""

Wishes:
When I workout with my own music I mostly create ONE 30-60 min electronic music mix mp3 with a constant BPM with a mashup software. It would be nice if LEFT and RIGHT also changes in very long single tracks after a while.

Multiplayer workout

Other AI characters in the gym doing the same workout. Sometimes I feel so alone :)

Custom orbs (would like to use a Trump-face orb for more motivation)

More pleasingly effect when hitting an orb. I know there is kind of like a hit lightstreak animation...but for me personally...there could be more. Sure..there should be ""disable"" checkbox in the setup for purists.

More punsh varations and more workouts (but I guess thats on the road anyway) :-)

And now an idea I had while a workout today. How would be a Spotify integration?  Every user of BoxVR could use his own spotify account and log into it for his workout. BoxVR could then also offer a most used playlist with already calculated or orbsulated :-) tracks?!....

Doest not only require you to jab/cross/punch sideways/uppercut, but also works out the legs as there are several obstacles u need to dodge.

Multiple user profile support. This is so important!
Compatibility with apps and other equipment such as My Fitness Pal, GearFit or other similar fitness/ tracking watches to track your workouts, heartrate, calories burned etc.
More arenas and built in music selection would be great.
More workout routines in general.
Toggable on/ off FX for when you're hitting combo strings, hitting high scores, and other visual feedback.
Toggable on/ off announcer type voice encouraging you when you're doing well
THANK YOU!

As an addition to your daily routine, Box VR is fantastic. Really well designed workouts (though the selection is a bit limited to roughly 12 to choose from), the fact that you can workout to your own music is great - the downside to this is that if you have a very large library of music you'll be better off creating a workout music folder specifically to use with Box VR or the app won't read your large library otherwise [Devs; better implementation of this feature would be very welcome! Even if it means navigating to the music you want and it simply creating a copy of the chosen track in a subfolder within the app].

I do highly recommend this - though with the price tag being what it is, I hope they add more features and variety.","Jan 23, 2018 at 12:06 AM",4, 3,"Hi Thedarkcloak, this is incredible feedback, thanks for taking your time to write to us!

This gives a fun aerobic workout primarily using the upper body - a nice compliment to almost all other aerobic workouts which focus on the legs.  Another big plus is that you can create your own play list to find the best tempo for you, and use music you enjoy working out to.  Now the ""BUT"":    1.   I did a couple of 28 min workouts wearing my Fitbit Blaze.  The Fitbit has beeen pretty accurate counting calories burned when compared to other exercise equipment that monitor heart rate while working out.  While the Fitbit recorded a nice aerobic workout ( 5min fat burn - 19min cardio - 4min peak ) the calorie count was way off.  The game showed 513 calories burned but the Fitbit showed only 276 calories burned, a huge difference.  I tend to beleive the Fitbit.    2.  The program has to reanalyze the same playlist every time I use it.  This is annoying and seems unnecessary.","Feb 13, 2018 at 3:15 AM",5, 1,"Hi OldeCrow, thank you for your amazing review!

This is my second day with Box VR and I'm now addicted. I've never had such a fun workout, and I've tried everything from running to group exercise classes to bootcamp memberships. This app isn't just boxing, it also includes squats, so I'm sore from the squats today, which is exactly what I wanted. Great synchronization with the music and lovely scenes. The best kind of workout for me is the one during which I forget I'm exercising and the time goes by fast. I'm also competetive and want to beat the game but that requires real motion, and quickness, too! I can't wait to see what this company comes out with next.

2022-05-28 12:56:34.094812,PoolfanVr,Great compliment to the gym,"There are nights where you simply do not want to leave the house to go to the gym and BoxVR is perfect to ward off those feelings of guilt.  It's really good fun - the music is pitched just right and the orbs come at you in time to the music.   

I love the scoring system - the harder (or quicker) you punch the more you score and the longer you go without missing gives you a score multiplyer for each hit.  There are leaderboards so you always have a score target to try and reach.

A 20-30 minute endurance leaves you sweating and you can feel it in your shoulders so it is definately a workout.

Not quite 5 star experience as overall it is fairly simplistic and would like to see more features added - perhaps suprises to unlock based on achievements, more music to unlock if you get over certtain scores etc.

Only other niggle is that this is the first VR game I have played where I have really noticed being tether to my PC and felt it hindered the experiece but there is not anything the developers can do about that.

Can see this being a real 'go back to' VR purchase and there is not game to complete so a great purchase for the money.

I recommend starting with the beginner routines and not moving to the harded ones until you get 100% hit rate. I think people complaining about hits not being detected haven't done this to get a feel of how the mechanics work. I'm up to the endurance routines and it's 20+ minutes of sweating like mad if you actually try to land every punch. Great workout, great music, and frequent updates from the developer.

One thing worth mentioning. Some people dont know how to find their music to play in training mode. Game always open your user folder that is used as default after installing windows.

Within 20 mins of trying this game i could feel my arms getting that burn and defo worked up a sweat, 300 odd calories burned to boot. If you are looking for a boxing game this is not it, its not going to let you go toe to toe with a boxer in a ring.

I wanted to purchase again on here just to show my appreciation for the developers who are really working hard to create an incredible and fun fitness title. Basically it's punching balls and dodging beams of wood to loud pumping music and if you're ever fancied yourself in a Rocky movie throwing out combos and bobbing and weaving for 45 minutes a night this game will give you that experience. The best thing about this title for me is that the game itself just kind of melts away when I play, I just lose myself to punching brightly coloured orbs in a psychodelic tunnel to some dance and house tracks and before I know it I'm soaked in sweat and have been training non stop for an hour. Despite the simple game mechanics the flow of the movements is just great and never gets old for me.  In terms of difficulty it is less exhausting than Thrill of the Fight, which means I can go without stopping for 60 minutes, but it's a full body workout with lots of side bends, squats and lunges thrown in so you're really getting a full cardio workout. Buy a cheap pull up bar to go over your door for less than $15 and do pull/chin and push ups alongside this and you'll never need to worry about being fat and sedentary again! Word of advice though, buy a removable cover and interface for your rift, and wear a sweatband, as this will work up a sweat!","Jan 21, 2018 at 8:26 AM",5, 5,"Hi Kevin_Brook, thank you for your amazing support!

If you are incredibly out of shape yes this is a work out, if you are just a little to moderately out of shape it is mildly amusing at best. As for the music, no it does not work even with mp3, the quality is low despite the download quality and the timing is noticibly off.

The calorie tracker seems hilariously misleading and definitely is nowhere near the real effort expended.

I would like to see more combinations added to the game and some further iterating on the timing. There are never quick 1-2 punch combinations; strikes are always on the quarter note rather than mixing it up more. Still a solid base and I hope the development team keeps working on it because it really is a lot of fun.","Jan 21, 2018 at 4:59 AM",4, 4,"Hi Nerdonis, great to hear you are finding BOXVR fun!

2022-05-28 12:56:40.474483,Stundex,Finally not feeling guilty while playing,"(This is a review for the early access version of the game) 
Great game. Haven't skipped a day since I bought it. Now I can play and still know I did someting for my health. 
I hope you will add more workouts and especially songs. The premade ones are way better than when my songs get analyzed. (Maybe Spotify integration?)
And some kind of multiplayer would be the cherry on top of that sundae of a game.

I also don't have any tracking issues with 3 sensors. I had multople 100% accuracy games. And when I miss I know it was my fault. Not once did I kit and feel like the game did not register my punch. In my opinion it registers to easy. For hooks it feels like you only have to twist your wrist a bit and upercuts are also easily triggered when you just hit with the back of your hand. So if at all please increase the accuracy of measurment, so that I actually would need to do a hook to get a point for it. So right now it is up to me to be disciplined and do the right thing.
I also like how harder punches give you more points. Motivates one to really give it your all.

But yes the calorie counter is just a timer that counts up. It's nice to see the numbers go up, but if I were to actually burn that many calories I would need to eat a horse a day to not starve :D

ok here is what i want to see to make this game better. new zones to workout in i like the school gym the best so can we get a beach with like an ocean or sea maybe a Japanese temple all monk style with cherry blossoms. a system that rewards you for the strength  of a punch in a combo chain. and maybe toggled themed skins for the spheres if there is  like spooky place option to have spooky spheres you know what i mean. i friggen love this game and will support it till the end id gladly pay more  if u listen to the commute keep the updates coming. good job guys ur the best . WANNA GOOD WORKOUT BUY THIS GAME ITS THE SH#$.","Jan 20, 2018 at 5:21 AM",5, 1,Hi KageOgama! Thanks for your amazing review! It’s fantastic to hear you are loving BOXVR! These are some really great ideas and definitely things we will try to introduce to our game.
2022-05-28 12:56:50.050699,digil,Fun workout,"A lot of fun and a great cardio workout! Importing my personal music was quick and easy. It does take about a minute to analyze each song the first time you play it, but it seems that once it's analyzed a particular song once the game doesn't have to do it again subsequent times. Also, the song analysis was really good and the software incorporated it into the workout well.","Jan 19, 2018 at 7:54 AM",4, 1,"Hi Digil, thanks for reaching out to us! We’re incredibly happy to hear that you are enjoying BOXVR and hope you carry on using it to get fit! We’d love to hear about your progress!"
2022-05-28 12:56:50.075632,Simonmmm,PROPER VR,"So it's not great visuals which I know my computer could handle, and yes it would be nice to be able to increase the difficulty further, but this is a Proper VR game.

Hand movement
Dodging
In time to YOUR music, very clever

With touch, it would be nice if there were some martial art style, open hand, moves, but then it wouldn't be a boxing game.","Jan 21, 2018 at 6:07 AM",5, 0,"Hi Simonmmm, thanks for reaching out! We are currently working to add some polish and balance to BOXVR over the next couple of months so watch this space! A martial art style version is a great idea!"
2022-05-28 12:56:50.099568,Soggy_Monkey,Read the developer responses - they help,"I'm really enjoying this, it works and I find myself getting into a proper stance so my legs are aching as well as my arms afterwards. I didn't have a problem loading my own music (just kept going up a level until I found the drive where my songs are) - analysed it easily and the timing was fine.  I also completely agree about the power making a difference; it's like any game - you can do what you need to in order to get through it or you can give it some welly.  I've just done the same workout as my 8 year old and she got 6k whereas I got 36k because I was punching and really putting my body into it.  The entire family enjoy it.  My only comment is there doesn't seem to be a way to have seperate different profiles so my kids are bringing my stats down! :)","Jan 20, 2018 at 10:17 PM",5, 0,"Hi Mawmowkcw, thanks you for reaching out to us!

2022-05-28 12:56:50.124501,Voidmonkey,Fun & Tiring,"Overall very solid game with some flaws. Well worth the asking price if you are looking to get some excercise in VR. While I am not terribly out of shape, I fell ill almost a year ago and my fitness has fallen to the wayside as a result. I haven't been motivated to excercise even once in the past months but I have come back to this days in a row since getting it. It seems that punching flying skulls to heavy metal is more inspiring than staring at a blank wall while I excercise, who would have thought it.","Jan 20, 2018 at 9:52 PM",5, 0,"Hey VoidMonkey! Thanks for your kind words, we’re really glad to hear that BOXVR has got you motivated to exercise again, that is really inspiring for us! We’d love to hear your feedback about how we can improve the game and what flaws you would like us to address. Feel free to email us at support@fitxr.com."
2022-05-28 12:56:53.233802,Beedyboy,Great Cardio Workout!,"A great and smooth workout! It makes you sweat! I go to the gym on a daily basis, and playing around 30 minutes with the game made me exhausted! It is a great replacement for treadmill or other cardio excercises. It is more like a full body light workout than anything else.

Would recommend to anyone that is too lazy to go to the gym, or would rather stay home! :)

I d love to test new modes/maps or moves in the game, there are ways to improve it, but it is already very good!","Jan 20, 2018 at 7:09 PM",5, 2,"Hi Beedyboy, thanks for your kind comments!

2022-05-28 12:56:53.285662,GuyStandingHere,Fantastic Game,This game is a one of a kind and defnitely one to keep and show your friends. I would like the developors to add more stats. Make the balls larger and give a score based on how and where you hit the ball. I'll provide a 5 because this is one of VRs most killer apps. Great workout.,"Jan 22, 2018 at 8:20 AM",5, 0,"Hi GuyStandingHere, this is great to hear! If you pause the game during a workout you can adjust the size of the balls by adjusting the ‘Difficulty slider’.

2022-05-28 12:56:53.310595,Onyong,Really want to like it,"I really want to like this over games like Audio Shield, however there is currently a deep lack of codec support for local files. Audio Shiled can play any file format I throw at it, but Box VR can't seem to play anything aside from MP3's. I have tons of AAC, FLAC and WAV files that I use that simply show up as empty folders when I browse in Box VR. I like what I've experienced so far, but until there's better codec support, it's going to take a back seat to Audio Shield. Here's hoping.","Jan 25, 2018 at 3:00 AM",3, 1,"Hi Onyong, thanks for reaching out to us. At the moment we only support WAV and MP3 files, so therefore any AAC files (the default format used by Apple) unfortunately do not currently work. We are actively working on a fix to this and hope to have a solution soon. In the meantime you can convert your iTunes music to mp3 files by following the steps in this link (https://www.lifewire.com/convert-itunes-songs-to-mp3-2000442).
