2022-05-28 18:54:05.877080,SpacePirate1221,Much better fighting games out there,"There's two kinds of fighting games for vr, the absolute carnage and brutality type (like GORN for example), or the more skill focused type that focuses on blocks and counterattacks (like Blade & Sorcery). This game seems to try and make one that is both, but only by taking the bad aspects of it. Theres no skill to fighting in this game, in fact if you attempted to bting any kind of style into your attacks your probably just going to die. It seems like they were going for brutal combat, but they didn't add any of the things that make brutal combat satisfying. It just feels like pressing a button to watch a dummy die. And also the movement is the worst I've ever seen for a vr game, I've seen free games with better movement.","Jan 13, 2021 at 10:11 AM",1, 10,

2022-05-28 18:54:05.906002,DankEggSmoke,"Bad, Not worth it","Bad physics, limited and buggy gameplay and terrible graphics make this game a no go. Would have returned this but when I took off my headset in disgust the gameplay timer kept counting and it was running for longer the 2 hour limit for returns","Feb 5, 2021 at 11:34 AM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 18:54:05.935922,Maj.Spoiler,Compared to other fighting games...,"not worth it. 
Some ideas to make it better, I don't like to just blurt out hate, I'm a man of constructive criticism.
Sound effects, make it crash metallic when you hit a dummy, this weird plasticy sound is not something statisfying to hear when you hit something.
Fix, or loose the Flail/Morning Star. It is buggy as hell and keeps on glitching up and away... wich brings me to the next point,
Let players pick up enemy weapons from the floor. If my weapon glitches up and away... well the games broken then, no way to beat the Dummies.
Loose the bubble gun. Seriously, loose it. Were you going for laughs? you didn't get any, it is annoying to have to kill three dummies with bubbles....
Also it is a bit dissapointing to beat a Dummy to the ground and hit him again when he tries to get up again. Because nothing happens, he gets up anyways, even when being bashed in the head... I wish i had that super power.
The music is to chill. The game is called ""RAGE"" Room? Allone the music made me get rid of my rage, but not the way i wanted to get rid of it.
That is an overall problem. Where is the Rage?It is not in the music and not in the bubble gun (seriously, loose it) 
I wont say anything about the locomotion, I personally hate it, it's immersion breaking... other have to use to not get seasick, it's ok...","Jan 13, 2019 at 11:56 PM",1, 7,
