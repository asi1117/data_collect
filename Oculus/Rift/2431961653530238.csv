2022-05-28 19:45:50.537664,michael.lubuguin,Simple Target Range Sim,"Basically, this is a simple no-frills Gun Target range sim. All weapons are available (no progression system for getting weapons). Weapon selection is a bit limited (basically just one of each type, pistol, rifle, assault rifle, etc.). Controls are decent (reloading weapons is pretty forgiving) however my biggest problem with this game is the totally un-intuitive movement system. The horribly implemented Teleportation system is counter intuitive and frustratingly annoying.  Free locomotion would have been preferable, or at least a more straightforward teleportation system.","Jul 5, 2019 at 8:54 AM",3, 5,
