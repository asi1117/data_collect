2022-05-28 20:58:59.741667,Marirari89,Terrifying and beautiful,"From the moment I saw previews of this game I was in love with the art direction and style of the game. After playing through it almost twice I can say I still love the style, atmosphere, music, sound design, gameplay, voice acting and story. One of my favourite games of this year.",Oct 9 at 1:00 AM,5, 2,"Wow, we're honored to be one of your favorite games of the year! Thanks a bunch for taking the time to share a review"
2022-05-28 20:58:59.756627,Gonzaxpain,Very good atmospheric horror game,"I had a lot of fun playing the game. You don't really do much, it's basically an exploration game mixed with a few light puzzles and stealth but it's all very well done, the atmosphere is great, movement is very good too, controls, etc.
It feels like a proper game which is longer than it seems when you think about what you did in those 6-8 hours it takes to finish.
I could have done without the last minute of the game but I very much enjoyed the whole experience. I'd definitely buy another game like this from these devs, this was a very good horror game for people into exploration and puzzles.",Sep 13 at 10:35 PM,4, 1,We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay in the Barclay Mansion! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review :-)
2022-05-28 20:58:59.770589,krisvdvijver,Beautiful and creepy,"Wow, what an amazing game. I just played for more than 3 hours straight without taking a break, could't stop exploring the mansion. Wonderful light and textures. The interior of the mansion is beautiful and your arms and hands are among the most impressive I've seen in a VR game.  Somebody mentioned Wilson's Heart, yes, I don't know why but I thought of that game too while playing. And there's also something reminding me of The Shining. Great music and sound too.  Overall a top quality exploration/horror/mystery game that should be on every VR gamers' wishlist.","Apr 23, 2021 at 8:03 AM",5, 42,"3 hours straight? You earned our respect, that is longer than most of our devs could handle:-) Thanks for the review and for comparing the game to The Shining!"
2022-05-28 20:58:59.786547,DeeVanhorne,Across the Shroud...After a 26 year wait,"In 1995 17 year old me and my 11 yr old cousin found an awesome alternative to D&D, Wraith the Oblivion and two of its amazing expansion books (Wraith only needed 10 dice with 10 sides). This Game is a PERFECT Translation of what we played in 1994-95

Step 1. You DIE.....and wake up on the other side (Of the ""Shroud"")

Step 2. You meet your darker side (Your ""Shadow) because after death, your ID and EGO split in two....

Step 3. You find out you now have powers in your new form (Called ""Arcanoi"" by us original Wraith/Restless) Thank you again developers. I hope there are MANY Arcanoi in this game (Im only at the first save currently)

Step 4. You try to find out how you and your associates died, and figure out the rest as you go....

PERFECT and Cannon to the original Wraith - The Oblivion game.

Ill update my review once ive played through both Rift and Oculus Versions (Thank you Cross-Buy!)

My question for the developer, did you play the original tabletop game for sourcing material?

For some background history https://youtu.be/eBJO901NGY4","Apr 23, 2021 at 9:08 AM",5, 31,"This is amazing to read, thanks for sharing! We are proud to be the first studio in the world to make a video game based on Wraith: The Oblivion. As for your last question, the game's creative director Erik is a big fan of WOD and used to read all the books back in his younger days!"
2022-05-28 20:58:59.801507,OnlySkillAdam_,First impressions after 2 hours(PCVR),"I played the game a little longer and I must say, I was way too quick to write a review. The game is just picking up the pace and it seems to be good. The only thing, that I find a bit annoying is how your fov gets cut down when you move faster. I understant, that this is probably to let you know how fast you are moving. But the fov on the q2 is small as is. No need to reduce it further. Otherwise a great looking game, with an unbelievably compex audio. Must have if you like horror games, like outlast.","Apr 24, 2021 at 2:25 AM",5, 17,"Thank you for taking the time to post a review, we really suggest you keep playing - the beginning of the game might put you in a (false) sense of comfort but things become increasingly disturbing as you progress. We have also tried to create a game that focuses on lower-paced exploration, atmosphere and story, and while not aiming for the interactivity of Half-Life: Alyx you do get an inventory of items and different Wraith Powers to use later on (one of them being used to move those boxes you mentioned). There are also some unique enemies waiting for you further inside the mansion... As for the darkness, you will get an item to help you there as well:-)

So hopefully you keep playing and find yourself enjoying the experience a bit more!"
2022-05-28 20:59:02.941109,MORKofficial,A True Stroke Of Genius.,"I have been hyped for this project for quite a while now. And i was genuinly impressed after playing this game. I am personally a big horror fan, and love to see things like this appear. This game features a truly interesting and unique story together with great visuals and one of the best sound design i've heard in a while.
Afterlife grabs you by the scuff of the neck, and drags you down a dark and bizare story. The idea of ""Not knowing what happens next"" is truly thrilling in this game, since its all done in a very unique way. Afterlife doesn't focus on big jumpscares. Instead, afterlife scares you with tiniest and most slightly unnatural happenings. Which makes the whole scene even more unsetteling. I played this game on a Rift S together with a pair of Vmoda headphones. I truly recomend wearing headphones while playing this game, since Afterlife features great, clean and good ambiences to drag you further into its world. This was one of the major things that i apreciated about Afterlife. All these things together make a true horror masterpiece.

The only thing that i missed while playing this game was Collision Constraint. Yes. This game has physics. But your hands will pass through all objects. This has always been one of my complaints when talking about most Vr games. I quickly feel a big disconnect to the Virtual World when i see my hand pass through an object or a wall. Allthough in this game i didn't mind it all that much. But it would have been a good extra detail.","Apr 29, 2021 at 6:04 AM",5, 9,"This is such an amazing in-depth review, thanks for taking the time to leave it! So great to hear how much you're enjoying playing so far!"
2022-05-28 20:59:02.956069,AlabasterSlim,Legit Scary from a horror fan,"I’ve played a lot of horror VR games and nothing has scared me until Phasmophobia and now this game. When I started I was just enjoying the atmosphere, not really feeling any fear. But that atmosphere builds and builds. There aren’t many jump scares, but it’s gotten to the point where the feeling of overwhelming dread has really taken hold. I think that’s the best praise I can give this game. I’m afraid to go back.","Apr 26, 2021 at 5:39 AM",5, 10,"That is indeed the best praise, thank you so much for sharing!!!"
2022-05-28 20:59:02.972027,Amorgeddon,Walking Simulator -not much game,"So let me first tell you that i love World of Darkness - is used to play vampire for a long time in my youth- so i was really, really thrilled to see a game in that universe. Being a gost. Damm so much possibilities. 

So im nearly through the game about 80 % and let me tell you the game is short. It if you would play it with a walkthrough you would need 2h max .. but i say you need about 5h for the whole game . Most of the time you are aimlessly wandering arround to trigger some sort of event that opens another door for you - or you have to search for items. Thats basiclly the game - run arround with your ghost senses and find the next thing to do.. Boooring.

But the worst thing is - you dont feel like a ghost. You need keys for doors, later you can walk through walls and get some powers but they are also boooring. Cool i get  telikenises just to get some box away to get to area i couldn´t get before .. WoW. 

I don´t know what is up with the reviews here. Everybody is overhyped with VR Titles. If this would be a pc game it wouldn´t fly. 

There far better horror titles in the quest/rift store. Even Cosmodread that is half the price of this game offers FAR MORE game than this. I had to write this review to warn people getting in with high hopes like me.

There would be so much damm possibilities and interesting game mechnanics for being a ghost. But what can you do.. Walk through walls and telikinesis that you only use to get to new areas..

The 2 Stars are for the graphic, atmosphere, and creepy enemys- i think i counted 3 in the whole game now. 

I wouldnt bye it again- but i push through it now


Update to Developers Response:

Story is what i love most about games. And this one you get right.  Even though you could go far more deeper on what it means to be a Wraith and the Lore of WOD with this game.  I also not a sucker for cheap jumpscares- im just disapointed that it is more a visual novel then a game for me. But most people are fine with it. So all good.","Apr 27, 2021 at 8:09 PM",2, 6,"Sorry to hear it was not to your liking. We have aimed to create an experience focusing on story, atmosphere and exploration rather than cheap jump scares and tons of interactions. Being a Wraith is also more about coming to terms with your actions as a human being than behave like the classical ghost, and unraveling the reasons why you died in the first place and why you cannot really ""move on"". That said, we do appreciate that you took the time to post a review!"
2022-05-28 20:59:02.986987,MarBOcls,Great !!,"Great Game.Finished all in one go couldn't stop playing.Sometimes i wish i had a pistol with the clip ^_^.Great job devs,very polished,slow start but more you uncover the story more hooked up you are into it.Waiting for the next game hope it will involve some guns :D.

Yes Devs i think am one of those that can play hours and hours in VR games and dont get any sickness.Plus if you play good polished game which gets you hooked time flys.","Apr 26, 2021 at 4:01 AM",5, 4,"Wow, in one go? Are you OK? Joking aside, thanks for taking the time to post a review and for letting us know how much you liked it!"
2022-05-28 20:59:03.002944,Bristar68,Scary scary scary....,"Wow wow wow, what a fantastic addition to my collection. I'm loving this game, i'm just under half way through if the percentage screen at load up is reflective of progress. The atmosphere this game creates is next level, puzzles are complex enough to make you think and explore more and some things are resolved just by looking around properly as I discovered when I searched every open area I had access to looking for a certain item I needed when it was literally round the corner from where I 1st needed it lol...  As for the sound design, again this is mindblowing, creepy, unnerving it's just amazing how they have created such intense moments just through the sound... I got to the tall ghost/monster this afternoon, I thought I was hidden and then he found me, my missus couldn't stop laughing as I jumped out of my skin when he discovered me, headset straight off and time for a break lol... i'll tackle him sometime today.... So far this is up there with my favorites and look forward to wherever this story is about to take me.... well done awesome game.. go buy it.... if you have the nerve of course","Apr 26, 2021 at 5:01 PM",5, 3,We're so happy YOU had to nerves to buy it! Thanks for posting this amazing review:-)
2022-05-28 20:59:06.096669,saedus101x,Reminds me of wilsons heart,"The game focuses on narative and horror without jump scares, great atmosphere, and if you liked wilsons heart you should enjoy this.","Apr 23, 2021 at 5:46 AM",5, 12,Thank you for posting a review! We really like Wilson's Heart as well:-)
2022-05-28 20:59:06.112627,FlossyBadgeYT,lamo best vr game by far,"I had a few bugs while playing. While trying to pick up rocks and throw them my charaters arm went across the screen. Other then that and some stability issues, amazing game and I hope the bugs get fixed soon with future updates. I would most definitely recommend this game. Best vr game ive played so far.","Apr 26, 2021 at 5:38 AM",5, 2,"Wow, that means a lot to us! Thanks for the feedback and for taking the time to post a review!"
2022-05-28 20:59:06.127587,shugghead,Good but doesn't quite stick the landing,"Wraith the Oblivion is a murder mystery told in ghost story, that while creepy and scary to some attempts to be more than that. I appreciated that the game plays less on the psychological horror side of things and instead aims to tell a more traditional ghost story, that relies less on jump scares and more on creating an engaging story and a creepy atmosphere. It doesn’t always stick the landing with that, but plays well and looks great in the headset, making it still worth your attention

2022-05-28 20:59:06.143544,Eulenauge66,Too slow,"I thought I would never use a title for a review like this. I usually love a good narrative, I don't need too much action or combat. I absolutely loved ""Wilson's Heart"", for example.

Here I played until I met the first wraith. Meaning you have to wait and hide endlessly until that ghost creeps forward, never knowing exactly when it could see you or not. 

So I died, several times. But to enter that level you have to use your camera flashlight as a torch to remove some kind of trees blocking your way. If your camera is flashing, though, instead of a constant light stream, the battery is immediately empty. You have to return then to some kind of saving point, and hope that the camera battery is refilled. Which doesn't always happen. Sounds complicated and unnecessary? It is.

Like another reviewer wrote: I can't play more than a few times per week, for an hour or so. Being a ghost snail doesn't help.","May 6, 2021 at 11:43 PM",2, 0,"Thank you for posting a review! While start of the game does put you in a false sense of comfort due, things get more intense and varied the more you play. As you progress you also gain access to an inventory system with different items and as well as unlock different Wraith powers that allows you to move through walls, lift heavy objects from a distance and more.

With the Spectres you can use objects such as bottles, rocks or even books to throw the opposite way to distract them while you sneak past. If they spot you, you have the ability to temporarily blind them with your flashlight while you run the other way. The reason you cannot always get pathos from the save points is since this has a cool down to prevent it being abused. 

We really recommend for you to play the game through and see if you still feel the same way:-)"
2022-05-28 20:59:06.158504,REDKILLER091,It's Brilliant,"Only thing i'd reccommend is maybe an option to add in full body? Arms are really good! There are some bugs with the shoulders when i can see inside of them when moving my hand.
Really good for a horror game!","Apr 25, 2021 at 5:40 AM",5, 4,"Thank you for taking the time to post a review, it makes us so happy to hear how much you like it! We appreciate the feedback as well!"
2022-05-28 20:59:09.251232,JordanXP,Amazing game after the first half,"I’ve updated my review from 3 stars after starting the game back up and getting to a play through of 75%. For veteran VR players who have played most of all the top games out there; the first half of this game will make you feel like your just walking through a house completing tasks in a somewhat bland environment. Once you make your way down to the basement the thrill of the game really starts to pick up, I encourage anyone bored right from the 
start to push through to 50% completion. 
  The players who really got into VR when the Quest 2 came out might enjoy the first half of slower pace, walk and open doors; then listen to someone talk, but the more hardcore VR users will find it boring when comparing it to the other horror VR games it’s competing against.","May 3, 2021 at 11:29 AM",4, 0,Thanks for taking the time to update your review! Happy to hear you're enjoying the thrills in the game 🙂
2022-05-28 20:59:09.266192,JeremyC85,VR needs more quality horror titles!,Loved exploring the mansion and collecting all the lore.

2022-05-28 20:59:09.297109,RogerMurphy1,,"Please fix the issue with vines moving out of your way with the camera flash. Sometimes it works....sometimes it doesn't for no rime or reason.  When it doesn't you have to run around in circles to kill time and then find a save point to refill pathos after which it STILL might not work! It is very very annoying!

I hate to leave such a negative sounding review because the games itself is spectacular. All I want to do is keep playing but I have to redo it over and over to get passed the stupid vines blocking my way","May 16, 2021 at 8:20 AM",4, 0,"Hi Roger, to burn the rot you need to shine the relic flash onto this, not use the actual flash function. The actual flash function has another purpose which can be used to blind Spectres temporarily. Please email us over at support@fasttravelgames.com if you require further assistance :-)"

2022-05-28 20:59:12.416766,Dr Greg VR,Wraith was a pleasant surprise.,"4 hour live stream here:  https://youtu.be/ntu6dcM9kp8

I am a horror junkie.  VR horror is probably the greatest thing that has ever happened for me,. well besides the birth of my kids,.. nope scratch that VR horror wins!  LOL!  I went into Wraith both excited and also nervous that it wouldn't be a good experience.  I am happy to say that it is a good horror title.  You aren't going to be in constant panic mode like you are in something like Outlast or Alien Isolation, but it is a title that def had me scared quite a few times.  

Graphically the game is great.  Environment is very convincing, character models for the ghost that hunt you are terrifying and things are optimized great.  Sound design is also great with 3D directional audio and tones of terrifying sounds that come at you from every direction.  Game play is mostly hunt for items to solve objectives while evading the nasties that want to kill you.  Works great and def had some butt clenching moments.  You also have  a clever mechanic of holding your arm out in front of you to use your enhanced senses to find where you need to go next.  This game def had me scared a few times, I think it's a tad slow in the pacing.  It's def a good first horror title for people new to VR horror.  I won't destroy them like something like Alien Isolation with the motherVR mod or RE7.  So yes this is def a title that is worth picking up!  I'll def be finishing it!","Apr 23, 2021 at 7:36 AM",4, 18,"That is one long live stream, kudos for that and thanks for posting this review!"
2022-05-28 20:59:12.432723,BurningRose01,Wonderfully tense,I am about 2 to 3 hours in mostly for i cant drop it. It is a great horror game with a intresting story that i dont wanna stop. I am loving my time with it and only reason im not rating 5 stars are some bugs that were a little werid. like when a specter opened a door that i was close to and it caused me to float in the air or a door not spawning and able to see through the map. other then that it is a amazing game,"May 12, 2021 at 4:09 PM",4, 0,"We really appreciate you taking the time to leave a review, so thank you!

2022-05-28 20:59:12.448680,Test747,Waiting for patchs maybe ...,"I'm new in this game and i'm already enjoying this game !

But, i need seriously increase walkspeed and automatic run if possible !
Why don't put a selector for walk speed between 1 and 10 for example ?!

Need some grahics options too ...

I hope ...

Thanks","May 15, 2021 at 5:53 AM",4, 1,"Thanks for leaving a review! The movement speed is what it is to keep tension and there are no plans on changing that as it would affect the balance of all enemy encounters. We did try different move speeds early on, and there are multiple reasons we stuck with the current speed, all of which essentially boil down to Comfort, Physics bugs, or Tension. If we went much faster at any point, we ended up breaking some combination of those three no matter where we were in the Mansion, so we went ahead with the current speeds. The Rift version will have graphic options in the next patch."
