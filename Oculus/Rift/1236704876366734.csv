As soon as the gameplay started I regretted my purchase. Being inside the mech feels terrible. It seems taller from the outside. The weapons sound and feel ineffectual. The punching mechanic is even worse. The way the sheilds work (short timer, small coverage) isn't fun. Everything about playing the game itself is bad. Do not buy.","Feb 3, 2020 at 5:48 AM",1, 33,

BUT if you want a short but nice single player campaign, with a suprisingly good story and even better story telling, an intuitiv to use combat system and a main character that is simply human and thus easy to understand, then this is the game for you. I had a blast with the campaign and even played it twice (still only one day but it was a fun day). Sadly the multiplayer is realy as empty as described and in my opinion worse then the campaign.

2022-05-28 15:16:07.145383,VanillaBird,Feels Unpolished. Felt Amazing Anyways,"Figuring out what to say for this review was difficult due to the disgustingly small charcter max for reviews. The game itself is an on rails shooter that only really LOOKS like it's more. This of course works because of the amount of focus there is on combat. I'll summarize everything like this.

How did the game feel?
The game felt great, but not sitting down in a chair to play felt awful as I would sway and feel like I would lose my balance with the constant mech movement which is entirely out of your control. Gunplay was standard, and the game's mechanics were challenging enough that learning them was a fun experience that wasn't necessarily a hassle. Difficulty with the exception of a few sections scaled nicely and wasn't obscenely high for no apparent reason.

How did the game look?
The game looked pretty standard. The mechs were extremely detailed and I enjoyed looking over every last bit I could.

How did the game peform?
Sub-par. While I at no time during my 5 hour play experience lag, stuttering, or loss of tracking, I did experience bugs which actually made my experience quite frustrating at times. The worst part is that these bugs are often GAME BREAKING and will require you to restart the game to fix. These include:
-Respawning causing you to be unable to damage or receieve damage. This carries over if you head to the main menu
-Rockets fired at you will be untargetable and will always hit you regardless if you shoot them or even use a shield (which can block a single one)
-Options menu doesn't close if you resume play. You have to MANUALLY close the menu.
-Incorrect gendered voicelines were played as the female protagonist.
-The game will refuse to allow the firing of any rockets. This will persist for up to 30 seconds at a time.
-Enemies will occasionally not despawn and shoot at you from behind with the enemy indicator persisting until level completion.

Final Note. Difficulty spikes through unfair game mechanics aren't HARD, they're annoying.","Jan 10, 2019 at 5:17 PM",3, 5,

Short written review is as follows: 

Cartoons like Gundam, Voltron, and Evangelion were some of my favorites growing up, so suffice it to say I was really excited about the launch of Hawken, which was a mech game that was supposed to offer VR support. Working in the industry, I got to try it briefly at a preview event running on the Oculus Rift DK2 many years back. While I enjoyed what little I played of the mech shooter, Hawken was ultimately shut down and VR support was never officially implemented. This was really disappointing to hear, but I thought we'd probably get a bunch of other mech games by now considering VR is such a great fit for the genre. ...unfortunately, it's been pretty quiet on that front, until now. Archangel Hellfire is out, and it may be the best mech game ever made.

Like all great competitive games Archangel Hellfire is easy to get into, hard to master. The base PVP multiplayer is also completely free! So there's no reason you shouldn't be playing it! The paid version unlocks co-op gameplay and more mech skins plus the single player Archangel campaign. Considering Hellfire is just so much fun though, it's a game well worth supporting.","Aug 9, 2018 at 2:12 AM",5, 19,"Thanks so much for the support! See you on the battlefield, Pilot!"

2022-05-28 15:16:13.497394,Slick1984,First Thoughts,"I picked this up during the Summer Sale because they added, free-roaming, multi-player. I had been aware of ARCHANGEL since it was released, but wouldn't buy it due to being an ""on rail"" shooter. Well, I was wrong with my opinion. The single-player game looks great and the little bit of story that I've experienced has also been great. The ""on rail"" , isn't an issue. I was too busy paying attention to the story and playing, that I never thought about it. So, the single-player part of ARCHANGEL HELLFIRE is worth the $18 price tag. I'll be able to spend more time with the game tomorrow and maybe even get a chance to play some PVP. I am liking what I've seen so far. Just the single-player is worth the 4 stars. If multi-player is as fun, then I'll raise my review to 5 stars. Thanks for adding multi-player. It grabbed my attention and made me look into this game further. With enough people buying this game through the Summer Sale, there should be enough players to get the ball rolling on PVP.///UPDATE/// Plays just fine on an i5 4690-16GB RAM-GTX1070.","Jun 18, 2018 at 9:19 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:16:13.512354,Doum76,Goldorak Go! ;),"I mainly bought this for the campaign and because i always wondered what it'd feel being inside a Goldorak or any Mech like Pacific Rim... Sad it'S a rail game, but that's ok, i love all different types of games. My only major deception even thugh as stupid it might sound is, i'm having the feeling we are in a floating head moving around, as i feel like we are way too close to the ground as if there was no body or legs attached, hard to explain.. but as the hands seems to be so close to the ground, it's maybe just a matter of perspective, but besides this, i like it, i do a mission once in a while not to finish the game too fast. Only other issue i jsut find is, the shield, seems hard, when altening between left and right shield, to acutualy be able to bring for exemple, my left arm more to cover up to my right side, as you would hold a shield, you would be able to cover at least up to your left shoulder, but we seem to leave a blind spot when one of the two shield are recharging. But in no way so far i regret my purchased. Just hope you guys will evnetualy come up with DLC so all the effort put in the game doesn't go for nothing. :) Always sad when you finish a game you like for the campaign and no DLC ever see the day.","Jul 16, 2018 at 3:39 AM",4, 0,

They have followed up with a multiplayer arena ala battle-tech as a free add-on (showing they mean what they say as they've been promising an off-rails experience for the game), but you have to join their discord at https://discord.gg/aahellfire but they are pretty good about notifying people of 'peak hours' to play (6-9 PM PST as of this review).

2022-05-28 15:16:16.694841,Kinetic_Ken,Very fun game,"I enjoy this game a lot.  For any Battletech fans, this is the closest we have to being able to be an actual mech pilot!  Lots of fun, and good system that eases you into the gameplay.  

Thank you much for creating this game, and the price point on it makes it a no-brainer.  If anyone is having doubts about purchasing it, I would urge you to swallow those doubts and start the download now.  There's no way you won't get your money's worth in the first two hours!  

I did want to mention a couple things that I would like to see if they could be addressed.  I'm taking the time to write this review specifically because I noticed that this company seems to read and respond to reviews that are posted, and I think that warrants me taking some time to write a review.

For the solo play game.  I read an online review that talked about NewGame+, it was an option after completing the game to start a new game keeping all of the upgrades you unlocked to that point.  Since you aren't able to even come close to upgrading everyhing in a single run-through, this would be a great option.  At first I thought maybe they didn't make that option available because I played it on easy, so I beat it again on Normal, but that didn't seem to matter.  It was a little disheatening.  

The second is the ability to skip the intro scene if you've already watched it once.  You guys did an amazing job on it, but after beating the game multiple times, it would be nice to have the option to not have to watch it again if I didn't want to just because of its length. 

The last thing is my in-game height.  The ground appears closer to me than I think it should be given the height of the mech.  I think I should be higher off the ground since I'm sitting in the cockpit of the mech and not it's chest or stomach.  

Those issues being said, I still tip my hat to you on creating a wonderful game!","Jun 9, 2018 at 1:20 AM",5, 6,"Thanks so much for the thoughtful and passionate review. Players like you make the blood, sweat and tears that is game development all worth it. Will look into your requests, Hope to see you on the battlefield."
2022-05-28 15:16:19.777597,Nightgrieve,Very enjoyable (Updated),"(Updated Review, please see below) I love the idea of the game itself, being in the cockpit of a massive mech and having dual targetting systems is ALOT of fun.  While the single player campaign is incredibly fun I have yet to dive into the multiplayer much yet as my first attempt was met with a very minimal lobby of players.  The game is challenging while at the same time rewarding your growing skill as a pilot.  Its goal was clearly to give you the feeling of being a pilot in a massive mech, and it does this well.

What I've played? Roughly 2 hours of single player campaign.  I have not tried the Archangel: Hellfire multiplayer as of this review.

(Update: My initial review was critical of two issues; the main screen to switch between Archangel, and Hellfire as well as an issue I encountered in the 2nd level having difficulty breaking a bridge.  I am happy to report both issues have been resolved, Skydance fixed the menu issue and today I was able to move past the bridge issue as I found you indeed had to punch while holding down the trigger buttons to ball your fists.  I had been too busy focusing on defense to realize this had been my mistake until my 5th attempt.  I have updated my review to reflect this and heavily recommend this game for anyone that enjoys Pacific Rim and single player campaigns.)","Jun 5, 2018 at 2:38 PM",4, 2,"Great review man and thanks for the update.

It just takes 30 seconds or so to load the main menu, so don't think it crashed. Just wait and viola. If the game is crashing on you, repair your oculus install.

2022-05-28 15:16:38.744866,jjGuardian,Basic standing still shoot'em up,"First, the story is: ""insert any excuse for revenge here"" - It's simplistic. ... Graphics are very nice. The intro is longer then the tutorial but this because your weapon and shield options are so simplistic! The game play sums up into you standing in one spot while they throw things at you. Yes they modeled movement but you don't control any of that movement. They do ALL of the driving. You really have no strategic input at all. So in the final analysis, you stand there and shoot. That’s the whole game. No one shoots from the rear further emphasizing the simplistic/arcade nature of this (ahum) game..... HUD implementation is simply stupid! Hull, shield and weapon meters are in the periphery of your view but they also modeled HEAD MOVEMENT into the mech cockpit so when you turn your head to look at your meters, the meters move too! You have a punch ability that is really dumb because even though it looks really cool, they control all movement so you can only punch something when they intentionally set up a scenario for you to punch, it’s not a strategic weapon choice or option! The weapon and shield combinations are no less simplistic and infantile…. This game would be absolutely no different if they just held you in one place while they threw wave after wave of enemy at you. They drag you through some scenery instead before forcing you to stand in one place, that’s all. 0 Strategy, 0 experience, 0 story, 0 intelligence in the design, decent graphics, decent high level concept they just need a game developer to fill it out. That makes sense though because if you go to their site and check their careers, all they're hiring is INTERNS!","Dec 10, 2017 at 8:56 PM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 15:16:38.760823,youngwoo,So good you made me buy it.,"Played through the whole game on the free weekend. Couldn't stop thinking about it and had to buy to replay it.

Pros
-Mech is super polished. Well articulated and realistic. Whenever a mission starts I do a little flex and crack the knuckles like pacific rim.
-Last mission is really awe inspiring. Don't wanna spoil but I really wish the whole game was constructed like that. Tension, drama, puzzle, reflex, banter.

Cons
-Environments are rather....fluctuating in quality. Some areas are wide cool expanses, and some are boxy PS2 era cardboard areas.
-Enemies are pretty static...they just kinda, show up left and right of you, in a pre defined making it feel like a shooting gallery rather than a combat scenario. The hound enemies moved and weaved making them feel more like an enemy.
-Largely pointless male and female choice system. It feels like that budget could have gone to better use. hiring a second voice actor to rerecord and reanimate the backstory. Male protagonist, female protagonist, I don't really care which way. Its not like its a dragon age style RPG.


I am looking forward to any future projects you have. Archangels? Archangel 2? The finale seemed ripe for a tease...like 5 years later and an army of archangels at the ready against Humanx. 

Some suggestions for the next one would be decide what you wanna be.  Do you want to create a ""play your own way"" RPG mech? then you need more customisation, mech design, a way to specialise your mech. 

Or a call of duty, time crisis style cinematic action setpiece. Then you need more focused script and intruige in plot more varied gameplay that goes beyond a shooting gallery. see titanfall for a good example of this it has time travel, chase sequence on top of a convoy, ticking time bomb, all out war to name a few scenarios.


Sequel Wishlist
- Mech on Mech battle
- A tighter focused script
- replayability
-moar motion controls

If there are any negatives I would say that that the character choices are limited and didn't really gel with me personally. 
Also, the cut scenes start to get a little repetitive - it would be great to be able to choose to skip these once you've viewed them a few times - then you can just get back in the game instead of being forced to watch them over and over.

2022-05-28 15:16:45.100865,onceinAwhile,Good but not great,"Being the first on the mech genre; I was curious to see what could achieve. So far the game is enjoyable, although it is also suffering from design decisions that could be better.

You start the story as the test pilot of this huge war machine; then onward, it is a shooter on rail, kinda like these games you would find in arcade, where you use your gun to shoot at what the game throw at you.

The issue here is that the game break that feeling of being in a mech; allowing you to use your hands to actually aim. You may find it great (and the feeling of moving gigantic arms with guns is indeed great), but from a gaming perspective, that is the flaw of the game in my opinion.

A better experience would be more cockpit-oriented; there is a fun demo game on Steam where you drive a mech in a single mission, and that game is not on rail, so you use the controls to move, turn AND shoot. The whole thing feels more natural; instead of this game where you feel like driving a mix between a mech and your own body. Either go fully in one way or the other for the next product.

Gameplay is OK; acting and audio are sufficient and in general, the game is fun to play. Get it on sale and it is worth the money in my opinion.","Nov 17, 2017 at 10:50 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:16:48.190602,LocalYokel,Very decent,"Good game overall.  It's basically a shooting gallery on rails.  That means you do not control your own movement and are largely just responsible for shooting things.  Be aware of this before you buy as there are obviously some reviewers who cannot read.

Regardless I found it to be a unique and fun experience.  I did begin to feel like I was piloting a mech out of pacific rim or something.  Quite enjoyed that.  I liked the characters and the story and found myself getting engaged in their struggle.

Unfortunately it is kind of short.  There are eight chapters.  One mostly establishes the plot and gives a short tutorial and another is purely story leaving you with essentially six levels.  It could really use an endless enemy mode of some kind.

Still, I'd recommend it.  It's worth a play.","Dec 11, 2017 at 12:34 PM",4, 2,Thanks for the feedback. Glad you enjoyed it. The team worked really hard at packing as much content as we could into the title. Keep an eye our for our future announcements!

The graphics are great and the voice acting is pretty darn good. My only complaints are that there is no way to save mid mission, so if you have to quit you must start from the very beginning, and the waypoints can be a bit too far apart.

2022-05-28 15:16:54.529647,Karoshi,"AAA polished shooter, real short though","Game is really looking nice. The story also is likeable. And dispite the fact you are only controlling shields and weapons, not the mech movement, you still have your hands full. Playing on normal I got wrecked a couple of times. Using the oculus touch controllers I got no technical issues whatsoever. So that's a good thing, but to be expected paying 30 bucks for a game. Overall I enjoyed it pretty much. But right at the moment I was really getting into it, about 5 hours in, the game is over ... What is it with the length of VR games in general? Is it so hard to program the VR environment, that there is no room for a decent amount of 15 hour gameplay? I am not expecting the size of Skyrim or Mass effect 2 here. But for this money it should at least be twice as long. Oh well, at least I still got to play on hard and permadeath modes, so I'm willing to give 4 stars. Could have been 5 with more content...             
UPDATE: Since it only took me 2 hours to finish the game in hard mode, and I am starting to notice things like there not being any lip syncing in the transmissions, i correct my vote from 4 to 3 stars. Game is definitely way to short. 9 missions of about 12 minutes each isn't worth 30€.

All in all a great start for Mech games for the Touch.","Aug 4, 2017 at 4:19 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:16:57.691191,Worpath,hate to hate it,"easily 5 stars...until it crashes.  I just can't make it past the post bridge explosion scene.  Sometimes I can't press continue after dying.  Sometimes after continuing I can't shoot enemies anymore.  Sometimes it just crashes with a fatal error when dying.  After that spot i had no problems...so you may be ok.  Its cool....but you may want to hold off until the version is beyond ""submission candidate 2"".","Aug 24, 2017 at 1:36 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 15:16:57.707148,BuhGrilla,AMAZING!,"I watched several videos before buying this and all I can say is that they do not do the game any justice at all. Until you are inside VR and playing this game you have no idea how awesome it is. This game is on rails, BUT... so are some of the best arcade shooters in history. Controlling the mechs arms and weaponry is where the game shines. Switching between various weapons on each arm with ease actually feels like you are piloting the 6 story machine. Story seema to be very well written so far, AAA title for VR. If you're looking for a new shooter that you can sit down and play then this is it. I give it 9/10.","Aug 3, 2017 at 8:53 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 15:16:57.723106,DaigojiGai,"Old School, Immersive & Inclusive","Already been said here that this game is really well acted, has great visual effects and the immersion and experience of being in a giant mech, glorious. Love the RobotJox/Pacific Rim feel to mech control... this gang should pursue the license for the latter to give us an awesome Jaeger game. While on rails, given the chaos that is thrown at you, you won't even notice. Permadeath mode is highly recommended for a real thrill. That rant aside, just wanted to say thanks to the devs for having a person as color as the protagonist that isn't a sambo stereotypical caricature. Truly is appreciated.","Aug 5, 2017 at 2:40 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:16:57.740060,cybernettr,Political correctness out the wazoo,"Obviously, a lot of money went into developing this game. The opening animation sequence was very good, (presumably created using Microsoft holograpic capture). But I didn't like the character choices, which were apparently selected to please some social justice warriors' fantastical idea of ""diversity."" One of the two character choices was a woman, despite survey after survey showing the vast majority of action/adventure shoot-em-up gamers are male. As a result, I just couldn't get into the story line of the female character I happened to choose. But the fact is, I really didn't like either of the character choices, which I didn't feel reflected me as a person, but rather, some SJW's idea of what needed to be included foer political correctness purposes. As a unique individual who also reflects the majority of gamers, I didn't feel that my interests or identity were represented, but rather the need to fulfill some political correctness requirement. Such a shame that every industry must be ruined by political correctness, including gaming.","Dec 9, 2017 at 6:10 PM",1, 57,
2022-05-28 15:17:00.838772,pyroth309,Great but a bit short,"I went in expecting to be bored and it sucking but I was very entertained. Being a fan of Mechs and having played Mech games since the early 90's and online with multplayer battletech,3025,mw4, mwo... this game checked almost all the boxes for me. I was really geeking out when I first got into the cockpit. I'd say it's like an interactive universal studios ride or something and I got my money's worth. After about 10 mins I didn't really care that I wasn't driving the Mech, I just imagined I was in a 2 seater and I was commander/gunner lol. But yea Ultimately I wish it had about another hour of content and a bit more depth to the unlockables.","Aug 8, 2017 at 11:21 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 15:17:00.854730,Cropadoodledoo,Too short,"Great experience, just a short one, the story is ok but would prefer to just get in the action. I didn't have any crashes or glitches like others have commented, worked flawlessly. I would like a few 'arcade' levels at the end, like a shooting gallery with waves of bad-guys, that would really extend the life of the game, but now I've completed it, all I can do is replay the levels (and no doubt watch the same cutscenes again) and change the difficulty. Overall 4 outta 5 as my first VR game it was really impressive, but left me simply wanting more.. much more.","Aug 13, 2017 at 7:51 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:17:00.886644,Grizzley1978,Very close,"An arcade style gameplay, you are limited to a set path.  You only control the arms, but with that you have plenty of options.

Aside from the mediocure dialog, and arcade style gameplay, it's the feeling like you are actually in a MECH which makes this game AWESOME!!  Is this a AAA, far from it.  More of a AA game.  Pricepoint is on par.  This is what VR was meant for, when you feel you are actually IN a MECH.","Aug 4, 2017 at 3:24 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:17:00.902602,JarJarThomas,Generally good but sizes are off,"Gameplay has nice flow, it is not so easy as other games and visuals are nice.
The only problem i have is that everything feels to large at about 10%. Similar but opposite to elite dangerous. In ED on Rift everthing looks and feels exactly right but on vive it feels to small. Here it seems to be exactly oposite. In vive the size feels ok but in rift it is to big","Aug 4, 2017 at 4:31 PM",3, 1,
