Seriously, I love the idea, but RR didn't do his research into the kind of experience that would be comfortable to a viewer with a screen strapped to their head.

Once the movie started, it was pretty cool, felt like you were actually in the movie.
A bad part, I've played many VR games and got over the motion sickness, this movie... the sickness came back from some of the way the camera was showing/moving.
It's about a 10 min movie. Would of been a LOT better if it had more of a story and was at least 30-45 min.
Also would of been a LOT better if we were able to choose different options like a choose your own adventure movie with how short it was, possibly even if it was longer, that would be amazing.
Hopefully this is an intro in to how movies will be in the future, to actually be a character in a movie, but it really does need a 360 degree view, not just 180, many times I wanted to look behind me or look around and was unable to :(","Oct 28, 2019 at 7:32 AM",2, 6,

I've watched other 3D videos in VR and the sense of 3D was more effective than it was here. Also, ideally I'd want to be able to watch a VR movie in full 360; it's been done with Jurassic World: Blue, so it's possible. Still, pretty cool (the audio was solid by the way), and with the scale and 3D depth tweaked it would be impressive.

Second, it's nothing like 360 experiences (most of the field of view is a very poorly made fake theater). 

Thrid, proportion are very disturbing.

Four, it's really unconfortable, not beacause of the action, but beacause all the motions feel weird and unpleasant.

I've been a big fan of VRfilms for a while now and it's intresting to see what the medium can offer. I was very impressed by this experience, it felt like they had taken the medium seriously and invested alot of thought behind it. The scenes seem well planed, the script that ties the action sequences together is enjoyable and above all it left me feeling like I watched something unlike anything i've seen before. This will definetly be something I'll show friends who dont have VR themselves. And on a final note, the added documentary-shorts of how the film was made added some extra value to the experience, maybe not for everyone but I enjoyed them.

2022-05-28 15:47:17.702356,Mach13-13,Where will VR Movies be in 5 years time?,"It is after all a Robert Rodriguez film with  Michelle Rodriguez AND Norman Reedus.  So this review isn't about the movie it's about how it translates to current VR technology and where I'd hope to see it going

Expectations
When I first saw this and sat in expectation waiting for it to download I started wondering if it could be the kind of VR film that crosses into the realms of viewer 'interactivity'.  So... when it finally started and M-13 said ""make eye contact"", I wondered what would happen if I didn't? and I wondered if I would be able to choose different routes through the plot? Then... would I choose weapons? and then... I wondered if I would be expected to get involved in fight/shooting scenes? and would I be capable of reacting quick enough?  My perspective made me feel as though I should be able to...

But.. it seems not for now at any rate. That said it's so easy to recognise the Writer's/Director's foresight in choosing the scenes he did within the movie. Because, with a leap of VR faith and computed trickery these 'wonderings' could become second nature to our future movie viewing expectations. It's only gonna happen though if visionaries continue to push at the 'reality-scope', and dare to try.  Of course Movie/VR fans will need to choose to support such initiatives by buying into them.  And that is why I felt the need to buy this.. because... without a responsive marketplace... there will be no episode two that builds upon this one (The Limit Enforced? maybe) and any chance of me ever being able to Virtually Act with Michelle Rodriguez will be lost to the digital cutting floor of apathy (or some other such metaphoric erm... thingy)

Do I feel part of the movie?
For the most part I do and in some parts I momentarily lose it; mostly due to moments of action stutter, hazy depth and motion blur, and seeing the screen edge (a 200' FOV might fix that)

So does it work for VR? Yes
Worth supporting? Yes

2022-05-28 15:47:17.747236,FastLawyer,Great to see big name actors & director,"in a VR film, but to be perfectly honest, the whole thing is a B movie affair. Probably the worst thing about this production is the lack of AAA production values. Yeah, it has Michelle Rodriguez, Norman Reedus, and it's directed by Robert Rodriguez, but the 180 VR cinema quality is not stellar and the story, script and acting for the most part are substandard. Don't get me wrong, I love Michelle Rodriguez and she was awesome in Girlfight, but she's clearly phoning it in as there isn't much for her to work with (script-wise) ... she's basically talking to herself for most of the movie short. 

The camera is moving all around and any quick movement causes blurriness. It's just not a good idea in VR to do that and it's a rookie VR directing mistake because it's just not pleasant to look at. The action scenes look hammy and like most VR 180 videos, things in the foreground are clear but anything in the background is blurry and there's lots of scenes out in the open where it's just very noticeable (another VR directing mistake). 

Still, I purchased this and supported the effort. I want more of this. I hope the second episode is better. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes. Just don't expect anything as good as you would at the theatres.

p.s. When I started the app, the screen was empty as though the app were loading. All I did to fix it was click on Oculus home button and then from Dash select the app again, this time showing the app content. Also, when the movie ended I had the same problem and took the same steps to fix.","Nov 22, 2018 at 1:39 AM",3, 31,

2022-05-28 15:47:20.902796,ParakeetLeaf,Awful film and awful VR,"The film itself has to be one of the laziest excuses of a action film I have ever seen in my life. Its self explanatory from its paper thin characters, awfully boring and predictable plot, and even green screen scenes that would make Super-Man IV cringe. The 3D is awful and honestly feels like they didnt even film with a 3D camera, the depth comes more from the greenscreened areas and HUD but even that is pretty tame. Also the film should have higher FOV than this, its way to small. The film itself is 18 minutes as of writing this review, I guess they have more but they should just cancel it. If you want to make a VR film dont make it like a video game, make it more cinematic and unique. Something that makes us want to watch for the story and characters.

2022-05-28 15:47:20.918753,Marmight,Watch the making of,"I haven't watched any other VR films however this is obviously a case of Rodriguez playing with the medium. Don't expect much in the way of effects. How many sales do you think something like this will garner? Most VR games are incredibly small projects due to the user-base. Therefore to expect a film, using novel filming techniques, to have a big budget, is a bit naive. 

It is good fun for what it is and was a new experience for me. I felt a little uncomfortable at times due to slight motion sickness but got used to it. I also found it quite funny, it didn't overstay its welcome and the 'making of' added a lot to it. 

For the price of £3.99 it was worth the experience, but of course that is relative. Then again, if you're messing with an Oculus, how hard up can you be?","Jan 19, 2019 at 8:19 AM",4, 0,

The story was pretty good, the acting was excellent and the VR was perfect. The only negative, and I didn't downgrade for it, was that it made both, my son and me, nauseous.

I purchased this title mainly to support VR filmmaking, because I believe it is the future! I also wanted to see what big-name actors and a director could do in virtual reality.

I took off my Rift after viewing and was fairly disappointed.

**SPOILERS AHEAD!**

There were some fun moments sprinkled throughout the film: the big bad guy catching the bullet, throwing a henchman away with super strength, missiles hitting the plane and putting the dead pilot in front of the viewer. However, the story is nothing special, the videography came close to making me sick (lots of acceleration/deceleration and shakycam), and the moments that were supposed to feel punchy felt fake instead (it's really hard to mask stunts in VR!).

Your character doesn't speak and I think the intention is to boost immersion however I feel it unfortunately does the opposite and makes you this strange mute actor fumbling about. They could improve things by embracing the VR medium and adding some agency such as 2 or 3 choices you can make (i.e go left or go right).

2022-05-28 15:47:30.374463,RIZIN86,Everything not to do in VR,"Im sorry but this was not good in my opinion. The film takes every oportunity to force my view, rather than give me a cue for where to look and let me experience the story. I consider myself highly resistant to VR sickness but that aspect was a struggle even for me. The constant perspective changes felt jarring and emmersion breaking. First I'm a character in the film, then Im looking at the back of my own head, then I have a worm's eye view of a fight scene, then back to first person.  I was excited to watch this, I didn't expect all that much, and I was still super dissapointed. It really felt like they were trying to do everything that would ruin a VR experience. I feel like the way forward for VR films might be where the viewer is a perspective and not a character. It should move your view slowly or not at all and the viewer should be given cues for where to look and allowed to see for themselves whats happening.  This would encourage subsequent viewing and water cooler moments, ""Did you see x?"". I will say the audio was well done and 3 dimensional. A few of the camera tricks worked really well i.e. Reedus catches a bullet that breifly carried the perspective with it. If you get VR sick you should skip this one and watch Henry again while you lement the agonizingly slow build that is VR. I still believe Nathie!","Dec 18, 2018 at 11:50 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 15:47:33.531020,HousePainter,Why do we need this?  (TL;DR: we don't),"The ""VR"" perspective isn't enough to justify the existence of this horribly acted, half-baked disaster.  This is the kind of stuff that will kill any chance for serious VR movies in the future.  

It's a cash grab that uses a couple of familiar faces to help sell it.  It really doesn't even make use of VR, you have very little freedom to look around.  It shouldn't be called a ""VR movie.""  It's just a ""POV"" perspective like Hardcore Henry, plus some 3d.  

I am 100% convinced that this thing is only getting decent reviews because of the names and faces attached to it.  None of those names or faces are putting any effort into the performance, the entire thing reeks of something that was thrown together and filmed in a day.  But everyone is citing the names in their reviews, as if those names added any value to the production.  They didn't.  This is B movie trash, through-and-through.  Not even the fun kind of B movie trash.  You can even see the actors cringing.  

If we ever want to see this technology's potential realized, we can't encourage crap like this.  I have to admit, I watched it purely out of curiosity.  But my worst assumptions were proved true.  If it was free, it could have been a cool ""tech demo"" about 5 years ago.  But at this stage, this is just an insult.","Dec 9, 2018 at 6:15 AM",1, 3,

EDIT: K Lite Basic fixed the issue, its a safe program. I was missing a codec no big deal. 108 degree video with camera as opposed to CG images is what is being showcased here. Robert Rodriguez's trademark combo of violence, charisma and a bombastic plot play second fiddle here to the hot Michelle Rodriguez who offers an explosive performance. The format engages like a cutscene from a first peron shooter, it gives peripheral vision which in games is granted by mouse or thumbstick in this case by moving the head. Real people acting has its benfits when compared to CGI and so in one form or another I really think 180 degree 3D video, has potential for the daring director.","Dec 18, 2018 at 5:12 AM",5, 0,"Hi Chris 2033,

2022-05-28 15:47:33.562935,BreakMaker,Mixed feelings - reduce motion sickness!,"Let me start off by congratulating on trying something totally new. This was the first ""real"" VR film ever. The creators dared trying something others were afraid of I think. Full of action, and though it is really short (about quarter of an hour), it was worth the 5 Euros.

At the same time, there is one negative thing I have to point (the one reason why there arent any comparable VR movies like this): Nausea is just too intense. The creators of this experience committed all the ""sins"" there are in VR. You just do not take control over the ""head"" of the viewer. :D It is like somebody sticking their fingers into your brain and turning it around. And I am saying this being a VR developer myself, who has grown accustomed to VR sickness. In its current form, this cannot reach masses.

I feel the experience woud have been equally exciting and much less nausiating by just removing some things:

There is no need for ""head bobbing"" - really just drop it, it wont make the movie less interesting.

Implement something for the rapid turns. Try shuttering the view (like decrease FOV for the time of the turn).

Try and only use constant accelarations (like the car scene is not as instense).","Dec 9, 2018 at 5:27 AM",3, 0,

The story, the acting, the adventure, the stunts ... it has it all ... and its in VR immersion (well - 180 immersion - you see theatre seats behind you).  This has to be the future of cinema.  Why would you go back after being immersed in a production like this?  When my son was 8 years old, I took him a Shakespeare production where he got to sit on the stage in the middle of it all.  He loved Shakespeare after that, not because he understood it, but because he experienced it.  This cinema reminds of the power of immersive experience.  This has set a high standard.

The Limit was clear and easy on the eyes to watch; I REALLY hope there's more to come. Having Michelle Rodriguez AND Norman Reedus was great. To top it off, Robert Rodriguez directing.
You can't go into it expecting a Hollywood box office hit, obviously. VR and VR films are still a very niche product. So I don't see production studios dropping too much money just yet in order to create the next godly 2 hour VR film, per se. 

Now, if you go into it just to watch something quick and fun, and perhaps a peak at what COULD be if cinemas moved to VR as the new ""iMAX experience""; then you will not mind skipping your daily Starbucks and spending that $5 here instead. (-_^)d","Nov 23, 2018 at 1:41 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:47:36.734452,Aurans,Nothing Special,"I’m a Robert Rodriguez fan who usually appreciates what he’s capable of achieving with limited resources.  The Limit, however, is disappointing, even at $4.99.  This is a “watch it once” 3D movie with no real VR interaction.  I guess you get to look at elements to highlight them, but it’s no fun being completely mute and passive in an action film.  The film itself feels like it’s from the Machete universe — purposely cheesy as a way to embrace the cheap budget.","Dec 4, 2018 at 7:46 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 15:47:39.822193,Grimah,VR Film demo,"Hard for me to give it more than a 3 star. It's 16 minutes long (exc credits) And more of a tech demo than a movie/shortfilm. The scenes move so fast, it is a collection of action scenes that have no buildup. The dialogue is also terrible, with many lines being repeated and the story is rushed and has not depth.

However the execution is done very well, and with the right script and budget a 1 hour movie would be very interesting indeed. I would recommend this to people who want a taste of a VR short film. But even as a Short film it does not come close to the many great sci-fi shorts on youtube. This just lacks characters, dialogue or any sense of atompshere.","Dec 2, 2018 at 1:54 AM",3, 1,

The Tech: So...much...motion sickness.  My tolerance has built up to be able to play FPS games in VR without issue, but this?  I think it's because I wasn't behind the wheel, so to speak.  It's sorta like being the passenger in the backseat of a winding road that never makes you sick when you're the driver: this much camera movement in VR is rough.  That said, technically it's a marvel to watch and a thrill to experience.  I don't mind at all that it's only 180 degrees of vision: in fact, I prefer it.  I don't like having to turn around to see stuff behind me and higher quality 3D is possible if you ignore what's behind the audience.  Keep it up!  (Just maybe more static shots between the movement ones to let the inner ear settle down.)

The Story: What can I say about a Robert Rodriguez film that doesn't take itself too seriously that hasn't already been said about Desperado or Sin City or pretty much any other film he's done?  The man is the king of camp and God bless him for it.  He doesn't disappoint and I for one am looking forward to the next one.  Rock on Rodriguez.","Dec 1, 2018 at 5:03 PM",4, 1,

This is an action packed Michelle Rodriguez play date.
Kept turning my head to look at all the action until settling in that it was simply a 180º stereoscopic film.  So just sit back and watch.
Assumptions it was a low budget film, and many of the shot's compositing needed an experienced compositor.  If this succeeds, maybe more to come.","Dec 2, 2018 at 5:43 AM",4, 0,

We actually shot The Limit in a format wider than 180 degrees, so the edges of the dome frame and virtual theater are intentional but still give you a fully immersive view without the need to stretch your head and wonder where you should be looking.

2022-05-28 15:47:46.161238,dadadave,Can't really recommend,"I really didn't have high expectations after seeing the trailer, but thought I'd give it a chance. Mainly, I was curious to see how they'd deal with the challenges of the medium and see if there were any interesting workarounds.

The way they handle the camera made me feel sick and while I understand why they use it in different ways (one moment the camera is your head, the other it's static in the scene and you watch yourself), the inconsistency of that approach makes for a really jarring experience. Here's an educated guess: Action movies with lots of motion and sudden movement are NOT the best fit for VR! 

To be frank, the whole movie gives the impression of a filmmaker hearing about this cool new VR technology and giving it a try without consulting anyone who has experience with VR. Furthermore, while I get the experimental nature of the experience, realize that probably wasn't the focus of the project and assume the budget was low, the writing is consistently abysmally cringeworthy, and not in the ""so bad it's good"" fun way.

I haven't watched the bonus material yet, maybe there's some interesting tidbits there. I tried watching one bit, but it had no sound.

All in all, I wanna be supportive of people experimenting with a new medium, which is why I bought it, but aside from the historical noteworthiness of this VR experience, it's hard to find anything redeeming about it. Sorry to be so harsh.","Nov 24, 2018 at 5:08 AM",2, 0,
