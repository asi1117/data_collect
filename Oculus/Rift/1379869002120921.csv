2022-05-28 18:22:04.166940,Zapious,Maybe OK I don't know...,"The graphics were cute, however I quit the game early because I couldn't stand the CONSTANT motion in the game! Even on the train, you are very slowly moving which seemed totally unnecessary.","May 11, 2019 at 10:36 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:22:04.180903,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Good.,Neat animated realtime VR short film. Quality animations and voice acting too.  Its free so there is nothing to lose besides a small amount of time if you don't like it. So go ahead and download this.,"Jan 30, 2018 at 10:46 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 18:22:04.195863,cybernettr,It's a sad day...,"When urban terrorism and bomb themes start entering our animated cartoons, it shows we've started to accept such atrocities as ""the new normal."" That said, this is a nicely animated, groundbreaking short with great textures, reflections and more that shows how immersive VR cartoons can be. I just wish the storyline were a little more tasteful...","Oct 23, 2020 at 11:34 AM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 18:22:04.210823,icky427,good for the genre,"the writting was ok, but more importantly, it shows that this is a great format for story telling. being in vr i found it much more interesting than i would've if it had just been a normal 2d video. i could see vr taking over the movie industry and eventually being the new standard for watching movies. more and more movies these days are 3d anyway","Dec 1, 2017 at 4:17 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:22:07.328485,FastLawyer,"1st episode bombed, hopefully not 2nd","So this VR cinematic short had potential, but it just fell flat on its face.  At least it started off nice.  Maybe future episodes will be better, but this first episode left much to be desired.  The graphics were very good.  The voice actors did as much as they could with what they had to work with.  But the dialogue and story were just nonsensical.  And the whole first episode ends up not mattering because it was just a setup for the second episode after a dull ending of the first episode dud of a plot.  Hopefully the writing gets better.  I generously give 3 stars because of the high production values.  And because it's short and free.  That's actually good because the plot was boring and too simplistic.  At least the ending brought hope that a second episode might be better.  Might.  Or it could bomb.","Dec 1, 2017 at 3:11 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:22:07.343445,HeyJesseAe,Outstanding!,Very well made short animation. I honestly hope to see more in the future. Pretty well written.,"Jan 21, 2018 at 10:36 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:22:07.358404,DWinner9971,Great VR Cartoon with great Graphics,"I agree with cybernettr's review.
This is a great short cartoon in VR that looks great and entertains well! The only negative would be the inclusion of what is essentially a terrorist in a genre that might be appealing to children.
I'd love to see many more comedic episodes that lack terrorism.","Dec 3, 2017 at 4:11 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:22:07.373364,BlazerJake,A nice first step.,"Admittedly, the writing and acting leave something to be desired. Also, this is only the first episode. However, the whole thing is in fully realzed VR environments. This is what VR entertainment should be (but with better writing). It's short & sweet. Go check it out.","Dec 4, 2017 at 4:52 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:22:07.387327,innovacy,4.5 stars because...,"It's a nice one and for being free, it earns 4.5 stars :)
It's interesting and nicely made. The bots are fun looking and very interesting in this scenario. The jokes are ok. Surely it could be easily more than what it is, but who knows, this may come into a 2nd episode, as the ending may suggest?
It's a good break from everything else and from playing, and just enjoy it for awhile.","Dec 13, 2017 at 2:58 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:22:10.499005,BILLPC2684,this was AWESOME,"i watched the whole demo/trailer/teaser thing of the ""film"" and it was AWESOME it was so good i told my mamaw about it and she wanted to try it, she got my head set on and she watched it thouw VR and i watched thouw my monitor and she loved it X3 GreatWork i hope the rest is as good! :3","Dec 8, 2017 at 1:33 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:22:10.513965,Nukemarine,"Nice demo, but could do with gameplay","First, this is a nicely constructed demo to set-up a world with British robot cops programmed with human like AI taking on silly cases in New York. However, this is a demo movie with no gameplay offered at all. It does offer a preview of how they'll show cinematic scenes in the game.

Worked fine for my 970, but you'll need higher to get the full benefit it seems. Good for a watch or two.","Dec 4, 2017 at 12:16 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:22:10.527927,Sir_Lock,GREAT SHOW! PLEASE MAKE MORE!,"First off it's FREE! So why not watch it?
Second, it's Really Good!
You can tell a lot of time and effort went into making this conent.  
It's a great pilot for what I hope to be a whole series! 
Thank you!","Dec 14, 2017 at 9:03 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:22:10.542887,ethansilver,Great Movie!,"The movie gives personalities you'd normaly see in everyday humans to robots! It's funny, an awesome VR experience, and an intreguing story I look forward to seeing what happens next!","Dec 4, 2017 at 9:08 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:22:10.556850,Merenth,Very enjoyable,"Could have done without the urban terrorism plotline ( I see that cybernettr, has written better about this), but overall very enjoyable. Looking forward to the next episode.","Dec 4, 2017 at 12:42 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:22:13.722383,baggyg,Good animation and voice work,"This is a well presented VR episode. The animation and graphics are very decent. The voice work is good. However let down by a underwhelming story, humour and dialogue.","Dec 13, 2017 at 7:06 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:22:13.738341,timeball,"Not the best, but interesting","It feels sort of like a demo reel for a 3D animator, or maybe a show from PBS kids.","Dec 6, 2017 at 3:42 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:22:16.873954,tekno5,It's good but...,"It's good but it just needs a clean up from a few angles.
The near field VR focus is great but distance is a problem where double imaging starts to appear.
Distance VR  objects / characters are low rez which is a stark contrast to the near field. 
The plot needs work where the teddy should be evil in the presence of its master but becomes funny and lovable in the presence of it's enemy to make this more family friendly.
Sometimes you, the VR viewer are pushed through objects and scenery as part of the on-rail story telling.
You have no body or hands which makes you feel that you are not in a real VR world this makes you feel that your just watching a boring video so you turn off some of your sences which stops the immersion factor.
This could be great.
Regards.","Jan 4, 2018 at 12:23 AM",3, 0,
