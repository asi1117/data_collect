2022-05-28 19:46:03.522889,VibrationsOfDoom,A good title with some varying sequences,"I did enjoy this title quite a bit. Though a tad frustrating on movement, as long as you are continually facing forward, it's fine... If I find myself a little confused as to movement, I just raise the headset a little and see how I'm facing the front sensors (or the PC monitor in my case, as someone is usually watching me). The stairs sequence was kinda cool, and there's a trick to flying; just look up when holding down the jump button! It's quite an interesting little game; I made it to quite a few levels, and I love the nighttime sequence! I played it enough to know that I'll come back to it a few more times, not sure how far it goes but it's nice. Shooting the bushes was a nice touch, I love games that let you destroy the landscape a bit, and of course inside the temple you can shoot the urns! Not sure if the developers plan on adding anything to it, but I like it.","Mar 29, 2019 at 10:30 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:46:03.554804,rchrdcrg,Still ruined...,"Three years later and they still haven't fixed the controls. All they need to do is make forward whatever direction you're facing... smooth turning is already implemented. This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen, a fun game ruined by a single decision that should take like one line of code to fix. F this game at this point, don't bother with it. They clearly forgot about it and don't give a crap.","Dec 15, 2020 at 1:41 PM",1, 0,"Hi, thanks for the feedback! Yes, we did look into creating a room scale style control scheme, but unfortunately there are some technical hurdles we haven't been overcome at this time. Because of the way we handle movement, and particularly some of the things we do to make flying more comfortable, we haven't been able to make it work well enough to release it. We apologize, but at this time Neon 8 is a strictly Forward Facing only game, which we feel plays great! We modeled the control scheme off of the standard console style FPS controls, so it may help to think of it in that way. We'll update the page if we have a flash of insight and are able to add an additional control scheme.  UPDATE: we did implement a version that flew in the direction of the head but nobody here liked it. If I could track the orientation of the body relative to the head separately then we could make it feel good, but as it is now it just does not feel right. I'm sorry I did not update my response to indicate the failed attempts. I may upload that control scheme to a BETA channel. If so I would very much appreciate your feedback. Thank you."
2022-05-28 19:46:03.569764,FastLawyer,It's worth .99 cents,"I do like this game. It starts out very well, although it got very repetitive by the time I got to level 9. Strangely, the firs two times I loaded up this game it would not start, but on the 3rd try it started just fine with a tutorial even on the controls. You can use touch controls and they are nice to use for aiming, but that's about it, other than that it's just like a gamepad. I like the movement, but I don't understand why there isn't smooth turning versus snap turning. So you fly by holding on to the jump button and that isn't explained in the tutorial. You basically save these crying alien space babies (and the crying is annoying). You beat down the same alien bugs over and over again. The outside portions of the maps are fun and at first there is variation. But the variation stops soon enough and you're just going to bigger and bigger maps with more and more bugs that look the same. When you have to go up and down stairs, that's where the fun stops. That is the weakest part of the game. Still, I had some fun and for .99 cents you really can't ask for more. Buy on sale only though.","Apr 10, 2018 at 11:58 PM",3, 0,"Thank you so much for playing our game and reviewing it. We appreciate it so much. Sorry about your load bugs. FYI there is smooth turning controls - you can enable it from the pause menu (IMO it should be the default but we played it safe for those with weak VR stomachs). You really nailed both the fun parts and the problems with our game, thanks for the great feedback."
2022-05-28 19:46:03.584724,andybak,Fix the controls!,"If I turn slightly then I'm suddenly moving in the wrong direction which is very nauseating. ""Forward"" should be ""where I'm facing"" like every other game. 

It looks really pretty aside from that. A bit more info on how to fly would be good because I'm stuck as soon as I leave the first island. But that's partly because of the terrible controls.","Nov 24, 2017 at 8:42 PM",2, 1,"Hi, thanks for your response. I'm sorry the orientation problems are affecting you. I responded to another reviewer below who had the same concerns. We are working on a fix for this. Please keep an eye out for the update and try it. We hope it'll be better for you!"
2022-05-28 19:46:06.703464,Frog_Jacuzzi,Burst eardrums and bleeding eyes,"I can review this app, but not the game; the app was so bad it stopped me REACHING the game. I actually wish I could give a negative star rating.

Awful music (for morons and children -- but not very bright children) suddenly deafened me, even though it was on 70% volume.

The loading took so long I assumed it had crashed, and the loading image was so bright it left me with an afterimage, after I removed my Rift. I had lost any curiousity by that stage, and did myself the favour of quitting the app.

The load-screen's voice-over sounds like a young American girl, electronically altered to sound computerised in the most cheap and corny way possible. The frequencies present make for just another assault on the eardrums.

It is difficult to imagine that the people who made this app would have managed to produce an enjoyable game.

I play intense shooters, barely customised for VR; I have the so-called iron stomach that is required; so I ignored warnings about 'intensity'. But I have no desire to find out more about this game. I have enough intense shooters, and almost none of them have such awful pseudomusic as this. The creators should find someone that can hum a tune accurately, and see what THEY think of the music.

I played a lot of 80s arcade games when I was young. I still love music in the style of 80s computer games. Monty On The Run, anyone? :)

This, however, uses 90s four-to-the-floor dance, and not the good stuff. It is SO bad that not even ecstasy could fix it. So it does not exactly convey the right vibe.

F. Please try harder -- or, preferably, stop.","Oct 26, 2017 at 10:06 AM",1, 0,"Ouch! Sorry you hated the game. That was not our intention! We tried hard and wanted you to like it. Thanks for the bug reports. We'll retest on some different machine configs. I hope you give the game another chance, we'd love to hear your opinion of the game play. 
Thanks again."
2022-05-28 19:46:06.719421,taquitobuddy,Front Facing ONLY,"Do not attempt to turn your body at all, even slightly, as the controls will no longer work.  For example, if you turn 90 degrees to either side, pressing the joystick forward now moves you sideways.  Hope they fix this as it 110% ruins the entire experience.","Oct 25, 2017 at 12:55 AM",1, 1,"Hi, I'm sorry this ruined your experience. We are working on solutions for this. Our original intention was to maintain a body orientation separately from the head orientation. But the body orientation is not tracked and so we don't change it even if the player physically does change. Clearly that's causing some people issues. We are closing in on an acceptable solution. Please stay tuned for an update. Thank you."

2022-05-28 19:46:06.749341,innovacy,360-full-vr-arcade-combat-experience,"It gets you back to the days of Arcade gaming, but in a VR-like way, where you have to use your body (head) to look around and control what direction you want to move (no stupid teleporting). There's no limit here, you will move everywhere in the 360 degrees. The graphics are simple and like the early days of vector/3D graphics, but that is intended to give you that specific feeling and is not taking away from the game, quite the opposite, it works very well.  The difficulty also keeps raising as you move levels up. A fast-pasted game that is fun and immerses you deeply - maybe not for everyone - if you are not only in ego-shooters and the likes and have grown up also with things like arcades or early consoles, you will love this!","Jul 28, 2017 at 5:02 AM",5, 1,"Wow thank you! You really got what we were trying to do, thanks!"

My Thoughts:
Games like this take me back to the days I used to spend £££ in the local arcade. It's strange how VR can give you that vibe. (You can watch the rest of the video for my full thoughts)

Game Details:
WARNING! Neon8 is an INTENSE VR experience. The creators have gone to great lengths to make it comfortable for a wide range of players, but if you are particularly susceptible to motion sickness please exercise caution! For the rest of you who are unsatisfied with current methods of VR locomotion, this is the game you’ve been waiting for!","Feb 9, 2017 at 2:50 AM",4, 0,
