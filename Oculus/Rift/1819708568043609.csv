2022-05-28 17:11:24.441171,xAstroBoy,"It has success, but ton of stuff missing","Alot of glitches, 
Story mode height, you are too tiny, this annoys me
You can glitch easily out of world with crouching, or going under another pavement.
Once you jointed a item, you can't detach it anymore. This is annoying, hence you can't fix anything.
Human needs clothes. looking them just naked is disgusting and strange.
Doesn't matter if they dont have bones, atleast make them less glitchy?
a small hit makes a huge crack texture, this texture gets everywhere, it shouldn't be like that, even in the water? No thanks.
Everything that moves aren't stable, it just falls apart.
Sandbox mode , you can't climb !
Teleport effect is annoying, make it less warping!
Every item you pick that is too big, makes ton of texture cracks, and it glitches soo easily , and the human glitches too!","Feb 1, 2019 at 6:15 PM",2, 32,
2022-05-28 17:11:24.457129,marmishurenko,Work of art!,"You will probably need something better than 1060 to play it properly, but the game is genius. It’s fun, really inventive, the music is nice and professor Sos is an absolute charmer. Mosh Pit simulator is pushing VR to the new realm of possibility. It is made by solo developer so remember: scientists say that being pesky about the bugs can make your genitalia explode!","Feb 3, 2019 at 1:25 PM",5, 21,

My Thoughts:
Great physics and wacky worlds, if you like sandbox games like 'Goat Simulator' you'll probably love this.","Feb 7, 2019 at 4:24 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 17:11:27.588753,FriskyBiscuit31,good game but..,"the thing that i hate the most are the people, mainly because of how ugly they are, and you have to agree that when you turn around to see some thing like that running at you, you probably would be scared. I like the game though because, its fun, creative, and silly witch creates a good sandbox for vr. But do fix the bugs and gliches. Thanks!","Feb 13, 2019 at 10:31 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 17:11:27.603713,Camzillaz,BEAUTIFUL,"I have never played a VR game that is so fun and wierd.Truely a work of art and smarts,just wish that you could do more stuff:being able to enter more buildings, get different stuff from the giftbox, and lastly having an oppertunity to go to different and wackier places. but otherwise totaly RECOMEND this game.","Feb 18, 2019 at 11:46 AM",5, 3,
