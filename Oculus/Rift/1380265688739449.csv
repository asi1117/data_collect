2022-05-28 19:43:30.247923,OiYou,1st class,"One of my favourite experiences in vr. The controls are simple and it is such a pleasant and relaxing way to avoid housework, college assignments, family commitments, life and everything else that isn't a train.
I have lost a lot of time in this engrossing little sandbox and haven't regretted a second. It is well worth the price.
There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this game as it stands but there are definitly aspects that could be expanded. I hope the developers get the moral and financial support to keep this title growing. The 1st person perspective would be good, also the option to select multiple sections of track that are already connected. I wouls also like to be able to take screenshots to share with family.","Dec 29, 2019 at 3:25 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:43:30.262391,bladenbug,Great Fun,"Bought this as i have recently purchased my first VR Headset Which Is just AMAZING, (Thank you Oculus). I purchased this with the intention of building up my collecton thinking it would be one of those games that i would play just to get used to the VR experience but have to say i haven't stopped playing it since i bought it, it is great fun to play, easy to use and just keeps you wanting to come back for more as you think of other tracks and buildings etc that you want to add after thinking about it when not playing it lol. overall a great title at a very good price. Well done SUMALAB.","Feb 25, 2019 at 8:08 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:43:30.278348,scooterles,Very Entertaining,"I have enjoyed playing with trains since I was a kid.  This game was highly enjoyable, and I love the new desert(?) world!  I have not been able to figure out how to view the ride from inside as the first reviewer mentioned.  The only improvement I would recommend is to add 1 more track section with a 45 degree turn.  Thanks, and keep up the good work!","Dec 2, 2018 at 9:07 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:43:30.293308,randito3,Entertaining,"Lets you build your own railroad and then play with your trains.  The trains dont have a remote control that you can turn them on and off. You touch your controller to it and start it going.  I wish it had a seperate remote that you keep with you to do that. Also there is no reverse for the train that I know of.  It was fun building the tracks and laying out the props, but it needs alot more props.  Also, if it had artificial grass it would be nice.  Playing on a white background kind of takes away from it.  One nice thing I found out is that you can actually have a first person view from the Train engine while its moving.  Really liked that. Hopefully the devs keep adding more content to it.  Its a great start.","Apr 19, 2018 at 12:47 PM",4, 13,"Hi, 
TrainerVR is a work in progress (in fact we've made a big updated since the version you played, I think). 
We're a small indie developer studio (2 programmers, 2 designers) but we've got big plans for the game and we're working hard to make them happen.
Hope you like it and have fun!"
