2022-05-28 18:38:30.410119,TGKLightning,PC Version Is Dead,"No Longer Recieves Updates or has a multiplayer. US West DLC Is A quest exclusive and they added depth, lure fishing, and bobber fishing to the quest version aswell",Apr 12 at 9:25 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:38:30.425079,Kombat_Plumber,Cross play and general game review,"My review will consist of 2 parts. One directed to the developers and one for gameplay.
1) Your game has been out since 2019 and people have been asking for cross play since that time. A few reviews down I noticed someone complaining about cross play in November 2021 and you reply ""It'll take some time."". YOU'VE HAD 2 YEARS! Get TO IT! The multiplayer lobbies are dead on PC and it'd be great if I could join some of the riff raff on their Quest 2. 

2) I enjoy the game, the scenery is lovely, but the game is quite easy and very repetitive. I do enjoy that I can open up youtube in game and break up the monotony to stimulate my brain while mindlessly reeling in fish. There are all of 6 types of lures and once you purchase them, you get an endless supply. I love the aquarium where I can place my caught fish! It's a really cool feature! But what to do with these buckets of money now that I'm maxed out on everything in the store? I need more to buy. More lures, gas for my boat, different fishing line, bait, BEER! SOMETHING!!! Gimme SOMETHING to buy!! When the devs fix the cross play oversight, they'll get another star. When I have a purpose for all this money, they'll also get another star. This could easily be a 5 star game.",Jan 17 at 3:56 AM,3, 37,
2022-05-28 18:38:30.440039,Atova,Crossplay Needed,"Heard about this game and bought it as some of my friends have it. Then after purchasing I find out it's not crossplay between headsets??? I didn't even know that was a thing. So because I have a PC and not a quest I can't play with them. This needs fixing ASAP. I can see other reviews saying the same thing for many months too. Is this ever going to happen or am I going to have to refund. Also, currently says Fail. Check Internet when I load the game, so can't even play multiplayer anyway. Disappointing as the game itself is amazing. Will change review if crossplay happens.",Jan 5 at 7:21 AM,1, 13,
2022-05-28 18:38:30.455000,DiggerDoug,Rift S Lags,"I absolutely love this game and have been playing it since season 2 and even placed on the top 10 leaderboard in season 2 however..........  just like a lot of other reviews say, it seems like the RIft S users have been left behind.  I have 3 Rift S headsets so I don't plan on spending any more money buying a Quest.  I know the RIft S will be updated next year but it's just a terrible feeling watching all the comments on the upgraded game for the Quest on the RVRF Facebook page and you can't do anything but feel left out.  It just kinda give you a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach.  Still a 5 star game.",Dec 18 at 8:44 AM,5, 15,
2022-05-28 18:38:30.469959,SentientMilkCarton,No Co-Op :(,"I bought this game initially to play with my family however, we soon came to realise that because I have a Rift S and they have Quests I cannot play with them. Hopefully, it may get an update in the future but for now it is dead in the water.

It is still a good game though.",13 days ago,3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:38:33.598591,loregnum,The version that gets no love,"Love this game natively on my Quest 2 but this PCVR version is treated like a red-headed stepchild and thus my 2 star rating instead of what would naturally be a 5, given this is my third favourite game in VR. It's a shame this version gets no love as I would prefer to play it streamed since it looks even better on PC, though it does look quite good natively on the Q2. 

I see the devs replying to other reviews that this version will get the Y2 update sometime early next year but won't the Quest version get a new update before then and thus this version will still be behind? What about the U.S West dlc? Will this get it next month as well or a multi month lag there? The point people are making is they want it updated at the same time as the Quest version. I understand the Quest version sells a lot better but basically abandoning this version for months on end isn't going to magically increase sales so I feel that they need to support development at the same time between both like MANY/practically all other games do, like Synth Riders, Walkabout Mini Golf, even now 2MD Football, and Audio Trip, just to name 4. Note that sales of those 4 games on this store are super low compared to the Quest store but they still develop/update them at the same time. They probably do it because they still charge money for this Rift store version. If you refuse to update at the same time then make this version free to play for all Rift/PC only users. 

Also, there needs to be cross-platform cloud saves (and cross-play) since I doubt even if this version were to get fully updated that I'd use it all the time because I would be losing out on 2 years of progress on the Quest version which is dozens of hours and almost every achievement. This feature shouldn't be hard to implement as multiple games have cross-platform cloud saving. No idea why the devs seemingly refuse to add it in as they are surely competent enough in programming to do it, given how excellent this game is.",Nov 21 at 11:34 PM,2, 27,
2022-05-28 18:38:33.614549,Psychwardy,Rift S NOT SUPPORTED,"2 hours of play time.

NO CROSSPLATFORM PLAY, Quest VS. Rift (nothing else supported)

The developer focuses on their Quest userbase primarily and their Rift users secondary, with rare updates. 

The lack of support for Rift S users I have to rate the game with 3 stars, it is a really nice game, but the features advertised do not work properly because they are only released on the Quest side.

Rift users last major update was ""Holiday Edition"" from December 2020
Quest users last major update was ""Spring Edition"" from April 2021
Planned update for the 2 Year edition for November 2021 (NOT RIFT USERS)

And the Rift has not received any of the recent updates the Quest 2 has gotten.  The devlopers are responsive when asking questions but it took a while to figure out about crossbuy.  If getting the game, try and go with the Quest 2 version since the Rift rarely seems to gets any attention.",Nov 9 at 9:22 PM,3, 5,"Hello, dustybeards.

2022-05-28 18:38:39.968554,dRIFTS_alot,Even more fun than real fishing,No cold weather and heavy clothes. No loading up the boat. No tangled fishing line. No getting up at 2 in the morning. No long drive to the fishing spot. No gutting and cleaning your catch. Lots of fish and the game seems to require more skill the longer you play.

2022-05-28 18:38:39.983514,wolfychaos,Great game but needs more features,"Picked this us for me and my partner to play fishing together, It is a great game the graphics of things in the game like the fish,rods ,boats etc are excellent but the back drops are very very blurry. It would be nice when someone in your game catches a fish rather then just announce they caught a fish, let us know if its the personal best and if it beats my own personal best, i like a bit of compatition when im fishing.Would also be nice if i could favourite a webpage inside the game or have a history as well, even be able to share a link within the game,so i can show the information im looking at or radio web link im listening to.
Apart from them things its a great game and no doubt ill be sinking a few hours into it.","May 6, 2021 at 5:03 AM",4, 2,"Thank you wolfychaos for the review!

2022-05-28 18:38:55.790236,LowRider72,Changing gear,"Just got this game earlier today and am working my way through it. Made a bit of money, bought a bit of gear. Looks good so far.

My question is - Do you need to quit out of the game entirely and restart game in order to get to the store to buy and equip different gear?  I have tried every button combination from in game while fishing to just back out to the store, but have found no solution. Please help!  

Thank you.

2022-05-28 18:38:58.919866,CPC900,Very enjoyable with huge upside,"At first, I thought there would be more locations, more lures, more detailed tackle stuff etc.  But it is a very fun and gives a realistic feel of fishing, IMHO.
I sounds like there will be more Locations, although you do get 20 different ones in South Korea.  So, it has potential to add MANY other world locations.  I hope they do.

The rods, reels, lures you can choose is sufficient, but it is no where near as detailed as the titles such as ""Fishing Planet"" (which is free and non VR)  But, it seems to me that Real VR Fishing could add lots of content in the future with updates or DLC content.  I hope I am guessing right on that ;)

The 3 difficulty levels make it easy for anyone.  I found the easy level to be a bit silly, in that it has an outline of the where the fish are.   Way too easy.  The Hard level was a lot better, because it gave a fish finder you could bring up, which at least made more sense.  And then the Realistic level had NO help options, which is the way I like it.  Just cast and wait.  The controllers will vibrate a little, like a fish is nibbling on the bait, so it is quite realistic, in my opinion.

One last thing.....it can be a good little workout reeling in a big fighting fish.  I have got some really good sessions where I have been sweating pretty good to haul in the catch.  

I am enjoying this game.  From the standpoint of reeling in the fish, this is the most fun/realistic fishing game I have ever played.  It just needs more content to make it better.","Aug 31, 2020 at 8:27 AM",4, 2,"Thank you CPC900 for enjoying Real VR Fishing!

2022-05-28 18:38:58.952778,MockingBirdRendy,Like back in the PS1 Days,"So i Bought the game on Oculus Store and played for 20min.
My First impression,

it looks a lot like Fisherman´s Bait 3 and Reel Fishing 2 from the PS1 as they also used Photogrphic Backgrounds.

FB3 doesnt have a big a** tank for the fish. The 1st and 2nd game where more arcady with every stage having a timer and a goal so you could not releay relax, in FB3 the timer was gone, you still had mission like catch that specific fish 3 times, or catch those 3 different fish and such on, also without the timer the game was more relaxing and fun. AND there were 4 secret fish, that needed special tasks to be done before been able to catch them, first one was to finish all stages and getting the last stage, the second secret fish was also optainable via last stage, the 3rd one could only be cought while having all other fish at the weight cathegory MONSTER, being the biggest of their kinds and for the 4th you also needed the 3rd as MONSTER size.

Places to fish where all over the world with each continent having 3 places or 3 stages to fish, this mode is calle World Monster Fishing.
Also there are a lot of stages in America for their fresh water fish, plenty of stages, beatifull backgrounds only in very low resolution, its a ps1 game.

RVRF brings those times back to me and i had a lot of fun with FB3.

Reel Fishing has 3 tanks, fresh water, salt water and riverwater, also you have to feed the fish that you put in the tank or the will die. As i Remember it looks a lot like RVRF. Fishing also all over the World and it was more realistic, as draging the Rod left or right could safe you catch or lose it making it a challange. Haven´t finished the game as i needed just one fish to unlock more locations and my fish often died as i forgot to feed them.

Backgrounds also where from specific location as photos.

For the 20min of playing a bit, RVRF looks like a combination of those 2 game series into one game.

Im feeling like im back at 12 years playing those Fishing games.","Jul 29, 2020 at 7:07 PM",4, 2,"Thank you MockingBirdRendy for enjoying Real VR Fishing!

2022-05-28 18:38:58.984692,user045,Quality Graphics and Experience,"This is a quality game. It's strengths are the realism of graphics, sound and high optimisation. I'd been looking for a game where you can truly feel 'you are there' with strong immersion and realism. This is it. The nightime scenes by the water are my favourites with the city sounds and car noises in the distance (really adds to the immersive feeling).

There's 20 different environments where you have to go fishing to get access as you progress. It's addictive and I'm keen to see more. Its great that DLC content is coming out with new locations and I can see the game being very popular and scalable if the quality visuals and sounds continues. 

Highly recommended and you can play Youtube music or your own MP3 files while fishing.","Jun 27, 2020 at 7:13 PM",5, 6,"Thank you user045 for enjoying Real VR Fishing!

2022-05-28 18:39:02.098365,lapezeus,It's A Pretty Legit Fishing Experience,"I fish A LOT in real life.  So in the areas where I may be harsh in my review, that's the reason why.  All in all, it's a pretty legit fishing experience for not being real.  

I do, however, have a couple of suggestions that would make it more realistic and thus, more enjoyable. The gameplay dynamics of how you work the baits needs to fit with the way a particular lure performs IRL.  For example, It seems that to catch anything on a crankbait in this game, I basically have to let the lure just sit there in the water as if it were a live worm or minnow.  The fish basically never hit any lure in this game if it's actively being reeled in.  In actual fishing, crankbaits, spinners, spoons, and any other type of ""swimming baits"" are SUPPOSED to be on the move when you're using them.  It's supposed to be reeled in - even if somewhat slowly - because a swim bait supposed to swim.  You don't just let a crankbait soak in the water IRL, nor would you need to ""set the hook"" on a swimbait with treble hooks.   

The soaking and gently tugging style of fishing in this game is, however, fairly real when you're fishing with a plastic worm - because that's how you fish with a plastic worm IRL. I would like to see the tugging movements that you can make with your rod actually carry over with realistic physics in the game, though.  I mean, if I throw out a plastic worm, lower my rod tip, and then tighten my line, then the worm should be pulled towards me when I pull the rod tip away - say to my side or if I were to pull it back past my head.  Instead, the bait stays in a static place and so tugging my rod tip back doesn't move the bait towards the direction of my pull at all.  The only way to get the bait moving back towards you is to reel in this game.  IRL with plastics like this, I drop the rod tip, reel up the slack, then I tug to slowly crawl the bait. Rinse and repeat. Anyhow this game is a lifesaver during this coronavirus BS. I DO enjoy it, don't get me wrong :)","Apr 17, 2020 at 7:03 AM",4, 46,"Thank you lapezeus for playing RVRF!

2022-05-28 18:39:05.323738,f0u666,Sadly not even close to the real thing..,"After reading some reviews, I thought ""That's it! This is the fishing game I always wanted"" But sadly it is not. I do a lot of real life fishing and my expectations for a fishing game are huge.

- First of all, the controls. You move forward, backward and rotate the view with the same analog stick, there's no strafing, and you cannot walk when you fish. Fix that.

- The line feels like an infinite elastic. The angle at which you hold the rod doesnt do anything. Holding your rod high or low has no effect on the fish except when the game asks you to do so. You cannot jerk... The only way to bring a fish closer is by reeling. Fix that.

- There's no drag mechanics. You can only hear the drag sing at the start of a fight when you catch a bigger fish and you cannot do anything with it. You can not tighten or loosen it. In real life, you'll never ever lose a big fish if your drag is adjusted correctly except if you run out of line. Fix that.

- Fish finder googles? Really? God NO!

- 3 intense minutes to reel in a 15 inches catfish? For real? Should be more like 20 seconds. Fix that

- When you choose to release a fish for XP,  you still can put it in your aquarium! Why!? Fix that.

- Goldfish in the wild?

Well I know it's not a sim and fixing all these problems would mean to scrap the entire game mechanics and start over. The game itself is enjoyable but it's so far away from what I expect in a fishing game. Fishing Planet is the way to go, it's a real fishing sim but I don't know when the VR patch will come out. Until then, Catch and Release is much more fun than this and I'll ask for a refund.","Apr 14, 2020 at 6:37 AM",2, 1,"Thank you f0u666 for playing Real VR Fishing.

Having played on Expert (with fishing line colors set to 'off'), here are  few things I'd like to see improved in future releases:

1. Casting physics. It's not very realistic right now - you just have to flick the rod to do a perfect cast.

2. The line is too white and thick. I suspect it has to be thick due to the resolution of our headsets, but it'd be nice if the colour could be more realistiic.

3. Even on Expert setting, the fish bite almost right away. It should take longer to get a bite. (Or does this get harder with level, perhaps?)

4. The size and sound of the splashes when a fish resists or jumps out of the water doesn't seem to be proportional to the size of the fish. Little fish seem to make the same splash as big fish.","Feb 9, 2020 at 9:47 AM",4, 10,"Thank you latearrival for playing and for your time writing this feedback towards RVRF!

If I were to gripe about anything it would have to be the latest version for Oculus Rift that adds salt water locations. The devs changed the water shader but with that it removed the foam that was kicked up in the water near the shoreline. If the devs are reading this please bring that back. It's a very small thing that most people wouldn't even notice but it does add to the realism and was very cool.

2022-05-28 18:39:11.647823,dabeerygoat,Pretty Decent,"This game is great and runs smoothly, and the list below are just things that I wish was different or was added into the game.  I own majority of the other fishing games here, and I wish this game had a bit more freedom and control in a few areas.  I understand this is not a full fishing simulator, but there are features I enjoyed more in the other games that I wish this game had.  Regardless, I would pick this game over the others.

A list of things that crossed my mind when playing this: (in no particular order)
1. Not being able to move around in the world made me feel restricted.  Pulled me away from the world.  Only being able to fish in front of you instead of 360.  When I made it to the boat level, it was upsetting not to be able to fish behind me.  It would have been great to be able to fishing in any direction. 
2. Casting resulted in the same distance no matter what (more or less)

Features that would be cool to see in the future:
1. An option to free up the hands in VR.  It would be cool to have a feature to place the rod down to use both hands to hold the fish. 
2. Continued from #1: Free hands to animate actions that can either toss the fish back in the water or place it in a cooler if you want to keep the fish for $$.  

Overall this game is great. It's relaxing and the world is beautiful compared to other VR fishing games.

Some variety in rods/reels/lures to purchase and a fishtank to stock for progression, could use a lot more though.

Cons-
Lack of gameplay modes unfortunately makes the game pretty boring after 1-2 hours.  Really needs something like a career mode, or some tournaments.

If you love fishing IRL I can easily recommend this to be worth checking out.  If you are just looking for a good VR game, maybe catch it on sale or wait for more content as there isn't much to do atm.","Jan 7, 2020 at 6:33 AM",3, 3,"Thank you AnnatarRedeemed for playing and writing feedback for RVRF!

2022-05-28 18:39:14.763490,DrGreen4umb,What a gem of a game,"I watched a bunch of YouTube reviews about this game and none of them really prepared me for how good this game looks, it’s staggeringly good looking on rift s, incredibly close to “real fishing” at times I didn’t even cast the rod out so I could take in the ambience and tranquility, amazing job devs 👍
Expert mode is the best I find, as it removes any arcadey bits from the view but it is quite difficult so playing it through on easy first is advised, the mechanics are great but the lures don’t really act like lures as in you don’t need to real them in, some things I’d like to see in dlc, use of a landing net, more wildlife ie random insects or birds flying close with high detail/sound.
If I think of anything else I’ll add the list, anyway I’ve got some more fishing to get back to.","Dec 10, 2019 at 6:26 AM",5, 9,"Thank you DrGreen4umb for your super kind words. I will direct your feedback to our team. FYI, we are to update the fishing mechanics in the coming year."

2022-05-28 18:39:14.796402,Pimparoni,Best vr fishing game available,"I really didn't expect much when I saw this on the store saw it looked realistic so I took a chance. Holy moly it is really good for a vr game, I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's in my top 5 most immersive games that I play on my rift s.  I can tell the developer took a lot of time to give fishing a legit realistic feel scenery actually feels so real with the ambient sounds that I get the same feeling I do fishing in real life.  

Casting... very well done so much easier to do versus another vr fishing game I play (ultimate fishing vr). Turning the game to expert makes fights challenging, big fan of the hook nibbling then hook setting it feels natural. 

Graphics are phenomenal not only are the locations 3d scans but their is added effects like falling leaves/rippling water/fog that add to the immersion. Sound is very believable and the added mp3 integration is nice. Hoping internet radio is added later on as an option. 

Overall very much worth the asking price. I had zero problems installing/starting up the game. I think some people need to evaluate their oculus setup or hardware configuration before leaving negative reviews as their was no conflicts of any kind. 

Things I would like to see in the future.. more large fish and gear designed for them that costs a lot. That would add an endgame goal to add longevity to the game. Please deeper depths also, seems like all of the fish fighting happens right at the top that's not realistic most fish dive deep to get away seeking shelter to escape in real life.","Nov 18, 2019 at 4:32 PM",5, 15,Thank you Pimparoni for taking the time to write this up! I am really glad that you like our game so much. Internet radio will be coming hopefully in December or early next year at the lastest.

The fish tank is a great Idea. Wish I could rotate to get another view or maby move up or down the coast. I tend to better one handed that two handed. 
NB.

2022-05-28 18:39:17.944980,OndeTv,"Great arcade fishing game, but...","...it could be so much more and so much better.

Visual immersion: 5
- You have done an amazing job with both photogrammetry and modelling in general!

Sound immersion: 4 
- Great job here as well! Only immediate improvement i see would be a greater variety

Control and feedback: 3 
- Good job here as well, but free movement needs some tweaking, as well as some of the rod/reel handling

Arcade fishing mechanics: 4 
- As an arcade game, it is great for sure

Realistic fishing mechanis: 1 
- This part could use a great deal of work

After 10 hours of play i have more or less completed everything though, which is a shame as i have hundreds or even thousands of hours played in other fishing games.

I also sent a very large feedback form reply at  https://www.realvrfishing.com/contact-us/ with a detailed description of my experience and many suggestions on how to make this game even better in my opinion. Some very simple and easy changes as well as others which would require a lot more work. I never got even a small reply though which i think is kind of sad.

Update:
Resent my feedback to the email listed in the developer feedback below","Dec 3, 2019 at 5:34 AM",3, 3,"Thank you OndeTv for your feedback. Can you please forward your feedback again.

2022-05-28 18:39:17.996842,CrunchyFish,Real Nice But Needs Work,"First off i have been fishing for about 35 years and i know a thing or 2 about fishing. This game has excellent graphics ,The scenerys look goood the fish excellent .The lodge is very nice as well. The few things i know will make this game much better are these...
1.. when you cast your line reguardless of the power used when casting the lure pretty much goes the same distance everytime give or take a few feet.
2. When reeling in your line it comes in way to fast for the distance it is cast out.
3. The fish need to be able to make a run back out to open water , not all fish come in without a few runs back to deeper water.
4. The game has no drag on your reel , fish pull back and go out to deeper water .
5 i play on hard settings almosty right off the bat and the fish are too easy too catch, make it harder to get a bite. and lastly i love the lodge and sitting on the deck please add something to look at while i am there relaxing, some fish jumping a shooting star or something like that. 6. Need more north american locations and species. I think you have a hit on your hands here with some improvments needed . Overall any one who likes to fish in vr go for this title.

Keep up the good work devs , money well spent.","Dec 21, 2019 at 10:09 AM",4, 1,"Thank you CrunchyFish for playing RVRF! Firstly, I would like to thank you for your time writing your feedback for improvement and I will pass on your suggestions to our team. We value every feedback that is being given!

2022-05-28 18:39:21.091564,GrumpyGogglor,Decent fishing game,"Overall I like the  game.  The visuals and sounds are great as are the overall game mechanics - how you catch a fish - are fun and even challenging for the larger fish.  Catching things for your aquarium is fun for a bit.  It doesn't take long, however, before you run out of things to do. 

Some thoughts on things to add: 
- perhaps occasionally when you reel in a small fish, a large fish grabs the line
- different modes of fishing; like jigging; reeling in faster/slower to enhance the action of the lure; bobber fishing 
- mode where you can't see the fish but you cast blind and hope to find something

Overall, a nice fishing game that is fun to play in VR.

Update:
Fun for a while but not much to do in the game very quickly and the developer hasn't released any updates like was listed in the description.  Not sure it's really worth the price.","Jan 10, 2020 at 8:17 PM",3, 1,"Thank you, GrumpyGogglor, for your feedback. Please try expert mode, and I am sure you will like it — no visual assistance except the line. If you prefer a more lifelike experience, try to turn off the line assistance too."
2022-05-28 18:39:21.108519,VinnyGunnz,Beautiful and atmospheric,"Beautiful, immersive, fun game.  Sound as well as little visual effects complete the beautiful environments adding even more immersion.  There is a fun progression system, whereby advancing in skills and ability unlocks items to improve your fishing, or add to a virtual aquarium in your lodge.  I don't fish in real life, but I do like to fish in games, and so far this is the most enjoyable fishing game yet.  There are many different environments to fish in which include various times of day and night.  One scene in particular stands out for me:  I'm sitting in a boat on a river and it's raining.  The sound of the rain and seeing the rain drops on the water was so peaceful and calming. This is a crossbuy game which is much appreciated.  The Quest version was fantastic, but on the Rift S it's even better due to the increased power of a pc as resolution and geometry feels like they got a bump, and the water and fish look even more beautful.  I highly recommend this game.  If you are on the fence at all and have spent a few minutes reading this or other reviews you are obviously curious or interested.  Just click the buy button, try it out.  If you don't think it's a keeper, return it.  But I think many people are going to decide this beautiful game is a keeper.","Nov 17, 2019 at 12:24 AM",5, 4,"Thank you so much, VinnyGunnz, for enjoying our game.

while ive enjoyed the titles before this one, they werent quite right. having fish that werent even real species but rather characatures of real fish that would sometimes EXPLODE or shoot confetti when you caught them.
 FUN STUFF no doubt. but NOT real fishing in the sense that, you want to BE there.

THIS DOES THAT. 

its fishing without all the heat. smell and grime of doing so. you can add you own music and i honestly cant see how it can get much better then this.

The environments are very immersive, the fish start off easy but then you really get into some real tough fighters. I've lost a couple big ones right next to shore. The directions you have to move the rod and the lighting fast reflexes required to hook some of the bigger fish make for a fantastic and fun challenge.
