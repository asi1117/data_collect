2022-05-28 18:11:46.724378,cav800,Outdated VR experience.,"I have to say that I started out sort of enjoying this game, but soon I encountered several issues that I couldn't get past. For one, I found the movement to be awful. You hunt across the room for a footsteps icon and the camera then pulls you in an unsmooth manner like you were walking and this caused me a great deal of nausea the more I played. Another issue for me was the terrible decision to include your character's body underneath you, which was always becoming detached and in my way. I found this to be a real distraction and it took me right of the the immersion. The graphics are also very faded, colorless, and oudated. I had to give up on this one and move on.","Apr 12, 2021 at 4:44 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:11:46.739338,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Good point and click,"Has locomotion issues. Touch controls kept closing stuff I was trying to read too. That said, decent game, nice story, and jump scares. Not perfect but good in VR.","Mar 18, 2020 at 1:02 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:46.754298,trgz,Atmospheric but quite flawed,"After struggling with the fairly poor movement I find myself with a permanent 'wall of black' in front of me (like someone has hung a curtain a few inches from my nose) - I can see objects out of the corner of my eye, and those that poke through this wall, but TBH I'm going to give it up given that the voice acting is amateurish","Jan 17, 2020 at 9:07 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:11:46.769258,Maura1129,Really liked it,I really liked this game - it is right up my alley as I am a fan of narrative/adventure type games.,"Jan 8, 2020 at 5:07 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:46.784218,DoctorDoorknob,"Intriguing and basic, but too glitchy","On top of the controls not being great and exiting found notes before I had finished reading them, I got a glitch in the Objectives menu multiple times where it would layer over the game world or pause menu, and even loading my save game did not fix it. I ultimately can't even finish the game, which is pretty disappointing because if not for that it was an okay mystery indie game thus far.","Jul 19, 2019 at 7:41 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:49.917837,jim1709,Crash makes it Unplayable,"I am one of those people that try to avoid No touch support game as much as possible. After thinking for some time I decided to buy this anyway just to see how it feels and I must say its a great game. Dont let the no touch support push you away, because it is a really good game anyway. Well worth the money.

UPDATE: Everytime I try to open the game it crashes, so now it has become literally unplayable. I do not think its the problem is caused be my pc or my setup since I already have played half of the game just fine.

UPDATE II: I've fiqured this problem out for some time now but thanks anyway for actually fixing after all this time! Here's another star for still caring :D, the game is worth it anyway.","Jun 9, 2019 at 6:49 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:11:49.961720,rh_galaxy,Good adventure game,A good story. Definitely creepy with good gfx and no real jump scares which is great news. Would have given 5 stars if there was voice for all the texts you have to read...,"May 16, 2018 at 5:00 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 18:11:53.127253,darkHorizon,Very captivating,"The graphics are a bit low, but the game keeps you in for quite a long time and the story is very well done! The scary moments are just scary enough to give you a bad feeling but no ""I won't play it again"". Still you sometimes get a strange feeling that something is there. I think this comes from the immersion with the Rift.","Dec 28, 2016 at 3:31 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:11:56.253890,bosy.princ,Thrilling Detective Experience,"I like this game a lot, I spent in there at least 8 hours and it was thrilling detective experience. Good music, great atmosphere, I still remember ""being there"". Voice acting sounds quite civil, but it is absolutely OK, it is not a movie it is (should be) rather authentic story. A play time could be longer, it is possible to finish the game in 2-3 hours. 


The game looks well and is not graphically demanding. I was able to set everything to max and set SS to 2.0 without any hiccups, all texts perfectly readable.

2022-05-28 18:11:56.268850,Leeringapple,Decent Horror game,This game is a very low quality horror game with a decent story. the gameplay is slow but the storyline is interesting and there are a few well placed jumpscares. I wouldn't say its anywhere near the best horror game available but definitely worth a play if you can get it on sale.,"Dec 15, 2016 at 3:00 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:11:56.284808,kamiklase,Makes good use of VR in adventure,"Nice detective adventure. Makes good use of VR. Crawling through a secret corridor, finding your way with a flashlight in a dark room, etc. Strong atmosphere. Movement is smooth. Graphics could be better, but good 'value money'","Nov 24, 2016 at 4:09 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:11:56.298771,chmodseven,Decent point and click adventure,"Great moody atmosphere and some excellent scary moments which I won't spoil.  As far as adventuring and puzzles, it's fairly basic but still satisfactory.  Movement might give your tummy a slight lurch if you're nausea prone like me, but I found it bearable.","Nov 27, 2016 at 6:39 PM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:11:59.432389,cybernettr,Non-standard controls,"This game requires solving various puzzles or mysteries, and unless you succed in doing so your progress will be blocked and you will not be able go any further--no shortcuts! Also, there is a LOT of reading involved--letters, newspaper clippings, short stories, etc. Control scheme is a little odd and non-standard--you don't move with the joysticks, unlike almost every other game. Also, you'd better learn to turn by by using the D-pad rather than by swivelling your body, or you will lose alignment with your character's body. Story is fairly formulaic and the characters fit certain predictable stereotypes that make it easy to determine who the culprit is.","Apr 26, 2017 at 10:54 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:11:59.447349,westingtyler,Great Spooky Detective Adventure,"This is really cool! One of my favorite Rift games, and really nails a sense of isolated, dreadful, ominous tension. Sound is great, story is great. If you want a nicely-sized detective mystery with some neat puzzles, you can't go wrong with this one. The atmosphere is eerie, and even though it seems rather mundane on the surface, it upsets me, and I don't want to experience it again because of how creepy and unsettling and tense it can be. Excellent work.","Oct 29, 2016 at 8:34 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:11:59.461312,bonarhya,Excellent game and experience,"One of the first experiences I had in the rift nearly a couple of years ago now.  Really enjoyed it and still rate it as one of my top experiences I have had so far.  I am really looking forward to the new one they are working on at the moment, will buy it as soon as it comes out.","Mar 14, 2018 at 10:59 AM",5, 1,
