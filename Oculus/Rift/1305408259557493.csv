2022-05-28 18:27:07.740507,DelapierceD,A Sweet Short Film,"If I thought it was a game, I would be disappointed too. But as a nominally interactive film, a short and very sweet experience","Dec 10, 2020 at 2:38 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:27:07.755467,animateclay,"Not bad, not great","For the money, this short film is worth the price. I'm thrilled VR is moving in this direction, we need more films like it. The need for interactivity is I think the only down fall of this project. As a viewer you are left wondering what to do next. You want to take it all in and look around but instead feel compelled to find the next scene trigger. Do you you take in the view through the windows? Do you look at an object in the train? Do you make eye contact with a crow? Will you have the same fate as the train behind you if you don't find the trigger fast enough? This is a bit of a distraction on what is important. That said, the story is OK. The graphics are OK and animation well done.","Nov 18, 2018 at 1:44 PM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 18:27:07.783392,Tarbal,15 - 20 min long,"Most expensive demo I've paid for. At 15-20 min long, not very good value for money. Cant say this game pulled on my heart strings. Just when you start to get into it, its over.","Apr 25, 2018 at 4:29 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:27:07.798352,Aquavemo,"What an emotional ride, wow!","Realising who i am and what happed gave me some strong feelings. Short, but worth every minute. Really liked the gaze mechanic and even more the reaction of the caracters to that gaze. Rigging, artstyle, music etc. was very good too.","Jan 18, 2018 at 2:57 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:27:10.941944,tonyfromsyracuse,abstract concept of the afterlife,"Very wonderfully done with the scenes and the music. very touching in places. as has been said, its a nice touch allowing us to decide when we leave a scene or change position on the train as I kinda liked to just sit and enjoy the weird scenery as I sat on the train and relaxed. the minds it takes to come up with stuff like this....thanks for the little world you created!","Dec 1, 2017 at 11:18 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:27:10.956904,cybernettr,Worth getting on sale,"Basically, an interactive animated cartoon.  Worth watching more tthan once to pick up all the nuances of the story, but not something you will play over and over again.","Jan 3, 2018 at 2:37 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:27:10.970866,Shon_t,"Just ""Okay"".","If you are okay spending a couple of bucks on an experence that lasts 15 or so minutes, be my guest... Stylistically I thought it was interesting...but I've seen better offerings for free...","Dec 16, 2017 at 8:08 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:27:10.985826,NateyBoss,Its very pretty!,"The game itself is very pretty, but I didn't quite understand the story myself. Its worth it for the visual experience and interesting mechanics.","Dec 17, 2017 at 9:55 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 18:27:14.115456,thecoyote99,Oh my....,"These are the kinds of experiences we need in VR. Was put off by the low res at first but after 15-30 seconds I was hooked on what was going on. Amazing how much can be told without words. So sad, touching and beautiful. Haunting yet poignant. Love it.

And for those who've already seen it, I think the bear deserves an oscar lol.","Sep 16, 2017 at 4:22 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:27:14.130416,FastLawyer,Warning: tears may flow,"This is a short, story experience for VR (a little over 20 minutes long for me).  There is very little ""gameplay"" here.  The gameplay mostly consists of looking into the eyes of crows or other creatures and finding some objects.  Honestly, the story starts out very slowly.  There is absolutely no dialogue.  And it's very confusing at the start.  However, the story climaxes into a very moving, perfect ending.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but you may cry at the end.  I think the story is open to intepretation, but I think it's about finding redemption after tragedy.  Seeing the things we have in common, our shared humanity versus thinking of only ourselves and how we can benefit from a situation.  I wish the animations were higher quality, but I understand the artistic inspiration the creators were going for.   I do recommend this VR experience.","Sep 14, 2017 at 8:30 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:27:14.145376,MarquisDeSang,"It's good, well made but not enjoyable","15-20 minutes that  you will not want to experience again. Story was banal nothing really interesting. A little sad but not as much as ""Alumette"". You are constantly waiting for the other birds to appear to move the story, it felt like a powerpoint presentation that you need to click to get the next slide.","Sep 17, 2017 at 10:18 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:27:17.256056,pixelpushinfreak,Very cool exploration of a graphic style,"The rough environment made me think it was low quality at first, but as it progressed, I realized it was more of an artistic choice than a technical limitation, and I ended up really loving the graphic style!","Sep 26, 2017 at 3:54 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:27:17.271016,CrashFu,,"Beautiful, heartfelt, and at times chilling.. not so much a game (except for mild scavenger-hunt element) but rather a short story told through the medium of VR.","Oct 4, 2017 at 11:39 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:27:17.300936,caj001,Short but Sweet,The story was way more touching than I anticipated. Knowing it was short in advance and having a low price made it a worthwhile purchase. This isn't really suited for sitting unless you're in a swivel seat. Otherwise prepare for some uncomfortable neck twisting.,"Sep 15, 2017 at 2:53 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:27:17.314898,metarobbo,Magnificent!,"This is the most CHARACTER that I've seen in a VR title so far. Beautiful little production, and plenty great design choices!","Sep 14, 2017 at 11:44 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:27:20.403638,ManMythLegend,Beautiful,"Sharply art directed story that delights and surprises. Sadly, ran into major performance issues throughout on 1080 w/16GB ram which make the experience hard to stomach.

2022-05-28 18:27:20.467466,ZedClampet,Very well done,"An interesting story told without words. Only runs about 20 minutes, I think, but is worth the money if you enjoy a good story. Would also be a pretty decent introduction to VR for someone who doesn't game.","Sep 16, 2017 at 4:39 AM",5, 2,
