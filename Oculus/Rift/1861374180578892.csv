2022-05-28 16:51:42.292995,CandiGurl,Fun!,"The only thing is--some of the food falls through the counter or plates. Also, it is set up to have only a certain amount of items allowed on the counter. It will start to delete the food so you can't really ""prep"" before you put an order together. That was not a thing until this last update...",Jan 13 at 10:33 AM,4, 5,

2022-05-28 16:51:45.502411,Wexlyz,Great game with active developers,"I've had a blast with this game. The controls are pretty solid and intuitive and feel snappy. Both the American and Italian kitchens were fun in different ways. The American kitchen can get pretty hectic towards the last levels with all the different things that need to be done, while the Italian kitchen was more chill and easier to manage.

I experienced a level-breaking bug towards the end, reported it to the developers and it got fixed within two weeks. Really looking forward to any new content they make! This game has great potential for growth.","Jul 17, 2020 at 7:47 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 16:51:48.599128,Popgoes678,So boring,It's so boring and the game will not pick things up even if you want it to. Also it does not track the item that you are holding. DO NOT RECOMEND!,"Oct 11, 2020 at 8:36 AM",1, 0,

2022-05-28 16:51:48.631043,HappyNotSad,"Game is fun, matchmaking doesn't work","Me and my friend got this game to play against each other and also coop once that gets added, but we spent up to 5 minutes looking for a game which is unacceptable and we just gave up. It plays fun, but only when you do find a game, otherwise it's just a waiting simulator. I don't see a reason why I have to matchmake and can't just invite a friend. refunded for now and if these issues get fixed and coop gets added, i will buy it again.","Jan 26, 2020 at 12:15 AM",2, 15,"The invite button was added in a recent update. Hope that this will solve the problem of playing with friends. Thanks,"
2022-05-28 16:51:48.647000,CallMeBain,Multiplayer unplayable,"Unfortunatley this is quite a fun game to play with friends, however after over 300s of waiting we only managed to play once.

Matchmaking needs to be improved, if you only buying to play with friends I would suggest waiting for fix before buying. 

£8 is as much as I would pay for this game.","Jan 26, 2020 at 12:15 AM",2, 8,"Hi, matchmaking is a problem as not too many want to play multiplayer n the game at the same time. There is also an invite button if you want to invite friends that was added in recent updates. Thanks,"

2022-05-28 16:51:51.774636,AndRoach,"Fun, but...",It seems like there is extreme lag when releasing grip from items. Takes around 3/4 seconds for thing to drop after releasing grip. Hopefully this will get patched.,"Aug 11, 2019 at 7:33 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:51:51.790592,Qalvael,Fun restored after developer response,"Being an early access game it is expected that there might be a couple of bugs here and there. With a bit of love from the developers I can see myself enjoying this title as I like these types of time management/cooking games.

However, the main issue I've encountered is the inability for my right touch controller to interact with objects in the game. As a right-handed person this does detract a fair bit from the experience since I'm effectively trying to cook with my dominant arm tied behind my back.

The right controller issue has also been reported in some of the other reviews here, though it is a little concerning that after 6 months this problem doesn't appear to have been resolved. I really hope this game is still being worked on.

It's not all bad though as the one-handed cooking I've done so far has been fun and provided an enjoyable tease of what this game could be like.

It is difficult for me to recommend Clash of Chefs in its current state, but I am certainly prepared to revise this review if the controller issue is addressed in the future. Also, a bit more content would be nice though I'm hoping that is another thing which will come in due course.

UPDATE (14 June 2019): A recent patch has fixed the right-hand controller problem which is great to see. Thanks to the developer for addressing this issue!

I had a lot of fun playing endless and casual modes trying to keep up as the orders got more complex.","Jun 14, 2019 at 6:30 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:51:51.805552,Klowza,Nice game in development,"After playing a couple of levels this is my impression of the game so far.
Good feel of the space, nice restaurant atmosphere. Hopefully multiplayer picks up a bit.
Handling of sum items is a bit off.
Position of the bread baskets and cheese are too much grouped toghether, when in a hurry to get cheese you very often come up with bread. The knife has unnatural setting in your hand, you have to use it almost like a wolverine claw blade, whilst the hands appear in perfectly acceptable positions. when you pick up the knife under normal orientation, after picking it up it twists in yer hand and you can aim it almost like a pistol. 

Overall nice game that needs sum improvements but is well playable.","Dec 16, 2018 at 9:15 PM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 16:51:51.820512,TangoQash,Fun game with a few bugs,"This game features immersive yet cartoon-like graphics which add to the fun of the game. The design of the kitchen was quite well done, with a lot of featuers/options in little space. Whether you are playing VR in a large space or are only able to move a little, you'll be able to play and enjoy the game, due to the smart level design of the developers. However, there are still a few bugs/annoyances in the game, but since it is early access and still in development, we can overlook those, as long as they will get patched in the future. I've experienced one major problem while playing this game, which made it quite hard to tackle the quick demand for burgers and fries - I wasn't able to use my right hand. While the game allowed me to move my hand, open and close it, I wasn't able to pick up or grab anything. Another issue which I faced has already been mentioned in another review, which is that the position of the knife in ones hand feels quite unnatural, which isn't a bug but should be patched as soon as possible. All together I am quite excited for the coming updates of the game, which will include (according to the ingame menu) new types of food and other things! 4/5 can recommend.","Jan 8, 2019 at 4:36 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:51:54.926205,luz.zubiate87,bad controllers,keep losing due to controllers it gets fraustrating trying to put the food on the counter .

Thanks."
