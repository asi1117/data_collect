By itself, this game is neat, though has several bugs.  Had a time where I entered an attacking state and couldn't leave it.  Another time I couldn't attack at all. If a fairy kills you and you encounter it again, it will likely not attack at all.  Controlling camera in VR is very difficult, and it feels too close.  Would love it if the camera would zoom out a little move.  This doesn't seem like a game that initially had VR in mind.

That being said, love the music and visuals.  Controls are overall satisfying, and intuitive. I am curious to see what else the developers are capable of in the future.","May 9, 2017 at 12:05 PM",3, 1,
