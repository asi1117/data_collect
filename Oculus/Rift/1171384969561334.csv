2022-05-28 14:59:34.775617,Hunter62610,A fun application for a good price,"I'd strongly reccomend you try this app if you are looking for a sculpting application. It still lacks features that Oculus Medium has, but the fully functional multiplayer and fun tools make up for it. As time goes on, I suspect this app will surpass medium.","Dec 10, 2019 at 12:49 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:59:34.790577,LifeOBrian,Creativity Unleashed!,"I LOVE THIS APP!  Of course, it's a bit more than just a creativity app, isn't it?  You could easily call it a game but it's more than that, too.  The ability to walk around in the environment you just created mere seconds ago is wonderful, as well as gliding around and of course blowing chunks of it up with a rocket (my son's favorite part).  I find it easier to create 3D models in this app on my Rift and Quest (THANK YOU FOR CROSS-BUY SUPPORT!) than literally any other 3D modeling or sculpting app I have ever used, and I've tried several.  Just something about it makes me relaxed and more comfortable with going with the flow than other sculpting apps.  The dedication to simple uncluttered menus is refreshing and they get out of your way quickly when you're working.  The scaling in this app is amazing - zooming in and out by ridiculous amounts within seconds is awesome, and you can easily go from building the macro world to crafting microscopic details on the fly.  The multiplayer is clearly still in early stages, yet as it is now I have had some of the best VR multiplayer experiences than any other VR program save maybe RecRoom.  I would like to encourage the developer to continue work on multiplayer, and at least give an option for a private multiplayer room so that I could safely play together with my young son.  Lastly, my favorite part: The OBJ file export option is great!  I've been making silly figurines that make my son laugh in SculptrVR, exporting them as OBJ files, prepping the file in Meshmixer (a free program), and then 3D printing the models!!!  We're literally going from an amorphous idea to real-world object that you can hold and touch and play with in less than 2 hours typically.  It's highly addicting!","Sep 5, 2019 at 4:41 AM",5, 23,

The multiplayer is awesome and i would highly recommend as a social and creative app. This is work of art, pun intended. I would give it 10stars even 100 if i could. Stop reading and go play it.","Sep 5, 2019 at 2:31 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:59:37.932174,Marcan37,Fantastic start but ...,"It's a good start even if at my point of view , this app doesn't seem finished . For doing big scenes , it's fantastic even if when we don't touch polygons ... the average resolution is too low ... we see a lot of polygons so it sometimes forces us to edit some zones we would let unedited if the average base resolution would be a little higer ( but the concept is good idea )  . Even with shading and texture , it looks crunchy... at top details also.  At least , to do maps for my Blender scenes , I find it seemed a good idea .

The major problem I have is to simply export my sculpt. None of the export setting seems to work correctly so , the app slows down long during long seconds and then crash  ... I'm just unable to add hair or fur with Blender as an example because of that. At the minute my sculpt is big ( I have 32 gbs of RAM + NVME SSD for virtual mem ) , the export is impossible , it crashes without any message .  

Why do all this scene if I can't export it as my first goal was to be able to export and ... why  letting me sculpt something big if the app will fail exporting it ? 

The app is in my exceptions in antivirus so it's visibly not the problem. Will have to troubleshoot . With Oculus Medium , I can sculpt very very well but not able to save ..... and with sculptrvr , I can save very well but not export at all. So .... ohhhhhlala. ..

As it is not enough .... they got not a single place where to reach developper team , which is unacceptable ... totally. On their Website , not a single section or hotmail adress to give to us .  

So sad virtual reality has such good concepts .... but sometimes full of bugs. 

For the finis toutch , I tried to be refunded but it was refused as I tried it more than 2 hours but , just to make you know testing a sculpting app is WAY MORE LONG than testing a simple game . Doing my first sculpt took this ... 2 hours ... to make me realize I was unable to export so it's an horrible thing.","Nov 15, 2018 at 7:48 AM",1, 17,"I don't use Facebook, but I'm active on Twitter (@sculptrvr).

I recently fixed a bug in OBJ export, This reduces memory usage during export by a factor of 2-3, but that might not be enough. The main problem with export is that exported mesh files are ~100x bigger than the voxel format. This explodes memory usage and can often crash the app :-("
2022-05-28 14:59:37.949129,MarkRushow,Thoughts,Nice little piece of software. Great for just starting out.  Lacks some more advanced features but don't let that hold you back. Has great inflate/deflate tool. Which makes life easier.,"Dec 25, 2018 at 1:49 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 14:59:37.964089,Azrayel,One of my favorites creative apps,"This app is great in so many ways. Layers for one thing.  The mirror function is something I found myself loving. The export functions are option heavy and very smooth. There is also a lot to be said about the interface of this app. It's actually fun! You can  feel the developers love for ease of use as well.  If you haven't tried 3D modeling, try this. It's really easy to use. They've made so many amazing updates as well. I'm always excited to see what is next. I happen to run into Nathan at  Oculus Connect 5, awesome guy!","Oct 3, 2018 at 8:47 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 14:59:37.979049,3d-illusions.co.uk,Everything about this app is genius.,"I'm a professional 3d artist, and have been using Medium for a lot of scultiping projects.  The only problem i'd been having was that the size of the models I could create in Medium and other sculpting apps was very limited.  With SculptVR this is no longer an issue, due to the way in which the sculpting brushes work, and the ability to have different resolution on one layer.  It basically adds more resolution the smaller you go, in other words, where it's needed, and it even does this for painting colours onto the model too, so if you want a fine line there's no need to increase the resolution of the entiire model, it will automatically do it in that one area for you.

My only suggestions would be: 

1, add the ability to select a block (in block mode) and then divide all blocks in the layer which are the same size by 4 (for double res) and then automatically smooth to maintain the original shape.  All smaller blocks will be left untouched for good memory usage.  The reason is, if you need to create a large shape, then the geometry created by the large brush will be unsmoothable, and a smaller brush size, although will provide the necessary resolution for good smoothing, it will take forever to draw the shape. 

2.  Smooth brush to add resolution in relation to the angle, for example on a flat surface (0 degrees) no resolution would be added, but on 90 degree angle, extra resolution would be added to maintain a crisp edge.  The angle could be user definable, so they are still able to round off harsh corners if they want.

3.  A falloff type when painting colour, which could either be gradual (no additional resolution crated), or sharp (resolution added to edges of stroke where the currently drawn colour meets another colour), currently I have to manuall use a small brush around the perimiter.

4.  More tools, move, sculpt on surface (from a distance), alpha brush (for drawing repetitive detail like scales)

5. presicions tools, for hard surface, snap, measure, etc.","Jun 18, 2018 at 5:29 AM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 14:59:37.994009,Mathhole,Never Ending Passion,"SculptrVR is my baby. I've had help from others (especially Brandon!) but I've personally spent almost 10,000 hours making it what it is today. I have no intention of stopping anytime soon.

Let me tell you why SculptrVR is different than everything else that is out there:
Scale.

In SculptrVR we use a multi-scale data structure that A) Makes triangle count and file size independent of object size, B) Allows for worlds with hundreds of hours of sculpting time without frame drops, and C) Makes writting all the code insanely mind bendingly hard.

I love SculptrVR. It brings me joy and pain in almost equal measure, but I love it. It keeps getting better and better, and I want you all to try it and share your feedback.

2022-05-28 14:59:41.112667,Drewskii88,gotta say more fun than medium!,"easier to jump into and start sculpting! granted there isnt really any guides inside the app however its pretty easy to figure out if you have any experience with google blocks ,tilt brush, quill or medium. the awesome scaling is hard to explain but allows for huge or tiny creations with great detail that uses much less memory and file sizes than other programs. it now features sub layers,floor grid,mirror, and snap to grid is coming in the next few days. its missing a 'move tool' however i just use the stamp tool and it gives you a selection box that copies your selection and with great detail allows you to place that stamp where you choose. Must say I can create awesome detailed models in much less time than any other program out there. Get it while its on sale and you'll be happy even if you dont sculpt. the fact that you can create your own worlds in voxel,mid poly and high poly texture and teleport,climb,glide (like a glide helicopter) and shoot rockets to destroy(make holes like the old red faction game on ps2) is quite fun.  Im surprised this doesnt have more reviews but i suppose more people are buying on steam :/ even though both platforms allow importing of games to each other. Can't wait to 3D print some of these models!","Jun 22, 2018 at 2:01 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:59:41.127627,riphitter,,I've had more fun in the first ten minutes of playing then I have in countless hours with other sculpting apps. The tools are straight forward and the scaling adds a whole new level of detail to the scene. It does what it sets out to do and it does it well.,"May 14, 2018 at 10:23 AM",5, 8,
