2022-05-28 13:35:10.582986,Critikal28,Hoping for Crossplay,I do love playing this game. Great game to show to people that are new to VR. My only issue is I did just buy the new Quest 2 to play with people at my house while I play the rift but cross play is not a thing yet with the Quest. Hoping they come out with a way soon so I can actually play with people in my own home. Please find a way to cross play rift and quest please.,Jan 14 at 1:40 AM,4, 12,

Do not buy it though if you own a rift s and plan on playing it with your friends that have a quest or quest 2. There is no cross play across the rift s and Oculus quest 2.

The ""use"" button does not work and says i need to buy them when selected. When i do have gold and buy to select and use, same thing. Stuck in clunky beginners outfit and no way to break my high score. 

BEFORE the update, my favorite game ever. This is a game of fine motor skill and agility. Some dislike the fact that armor doesn't add kill points but I think of it more as a social thing when playing with friends. Strategy is required for harder maps and you work to protect your kind through as many levels as skill and determination allow.","Feb 2, 2021 at 7:03 AM",3, 1,Hi!

Bad way to do business and sad too - to fraud people like that - when I specifically asked in the first review "" where can I get a refund"".. Then the answer should not be ""give it a second chance""...

There is no Difficulty Level to play - you just start it and the waves keep coming - endlessly it seems.
After 11 Waves, and the huge Dragon Comes in - you just die - no gold to get upgrades, no getting better gear.

When you die - the ""revive"" take TOO loooong..... Sitting around with a blood red screen, waiting to re-spawn while your Town just gets lower adn lower Health.

As far as the difficulty level of the game is concerned, as you start to unlock spells, you'll be able to get to a higher and higher wave.

2022-05-28 13:35:16.966171,JJJBlaze,Needs Work,"Bow and arrow placement with the hands is based on the pointer rather than the grip, so holding the bow is slightly off position of where it should be.  Defeats the purpose of VR without natural hand placement.  

Also, arrow accuracy was a bit randomly off, but not in the way an actual longbow would be.  It seemed based more on a compound bow.

Gold and items system did not work at all.  Gold dissappears after each match.  All items were listed as already purchased, but could not be used.  Etc.  By Etc., I mean the issues involved multiple different combinations of these issues which changed after a match was played.

End of Review

Developer Notes-

I doubt the pointer sersus grip issue can be fixed without remaking the game controls.  It may be possible to add an offset for the targeting and change the bow/hand placement to where it should be.  That may allow for using the pointer to target while making it seem natural.

As for the item issues, lack of a character data separation may have caused some kind of issue.  Or maybe the install was bad.  Or maybe this bug is common.  Don't know.  However, I have rarely seen an item, stat, and character progression system break like that.  I had only just started, so it is difficult to guess at any possible consequences if the bug is repeated by current players when they reinstall the game after a break.  Goodluck though.","Sep 16, 2020 at 11:46 AM",1, 3,"Hi! Thank you for your opinion. We are sorry that you encountered some problems with the game. When it comes to bow handling, maybe you should try the ""Arrow hand offset"" option. This very often helps with a better feeling of the bow. You also mentioned a problem with saving progress.

2022-05-28 13:35:20.113857,bankruptvermin,Awful doesn't begin to cover it.,"The game is unintuitive and difficult to control. For starters, there is no movement controls, as far as I could find. The hands the game provides you with are placed at a funky angle, giving the already unweildy bow an unnatural feeling (I realize it's VR). I don't mean to be cruel or awful, but I do have to say what it was like. The game shows promise, but feels like it was made for tech that doesn't exist yet. I can't say I enjoyed the few minutes I was able to play before I gave up, but I do want to end on a positive note. The game dev's did a great job on the graphics. If the game didn't show the promise it does, I would give it one star, but I can't exactly give it more than two. I'll leave this with one final note: I'm not sure the game is worth buying in it's current state, but I can only speak for the single player. To the archers out there, good luck!","Feb 5, 2020 at 4:38 AM",2, 10,"Hi!

Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that Elven Assassin did not meet your expectations. 

Can you explain what do you mean by ""The hands the game provides you with are placed at a funky angle""? Have you tried to adjust the ""arrow offset"" setting? Very often it helps with hand positioning. 

You also mentioned control problems. We have some tutorial information that appears with the first launch of the game on how to teleport for example. You can also find some information on how to use spells in the lobby or a controllers guide which is available from in-game settings. Would you mind telling us what tutorial aspects we should consider adding? That way we can improve in the future. 

Additionally, maybe you should give a try to multiplayer. Elven Assassin offers fun CO-OP and dynamic PvP deathmatch! 

I hope you will give Elven Assassin a second chance and change your mind about this game.

2022-05-28 13:35:20.128818,losno420,Good but needs work,"I actually enjoy this game for what it is.  You stand in towers and shoot at hordes of enemies.  This can be a difficult task at times as you need to lead your targets.
There's some unlockables and also magic fire arrows etc.
Pros: 1.Cool physics for the arrows.
2. The graphics aren't bad at all.(not the greatest but the game runs smooth)
3.  You can purchase upgrades bows and magic even helmets.
Cons:  1.  As far as I could tell quest and rift s can't play together.
2. Sometimes my bow won't knock an Arrow very annoying possibly the worst part.
3. There is replayability but content did seem scarce.

All in all if you can catch this on sale I recommend it!","Dec 28, 2019 at 9:09 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 13:35:20.144774,goesBang,Boring tower defense / wave shooter,"I can only speak for single player - and it's rather boring.

It feals clunky to change defense position by shooting at them with the bow - and you have to change a lot in later waves where the enemies come from different directions.

You cannot do anything for multiple seconds when you get hit by a thrown axe etc. The thrown axes also always come in at middle high / body center, dodging such perfect throws is hard and you don't really have the time for this (or you change position super fast).

You always start over at the first wave - like usual in such games - and start very slow and boring, just to get overwhelmed real fast because multiple effects add up: more incoming enemies, that throw this axes, and harder enemies that take multiple shots or even fly around. This effects add up very fast. From super boring to super hard in like 3 minutes...

With friends you could go into multiplayer and have fun as novices, but with strange guys I would first try to get some experience / get better - and than this single player mode isn't really fun enough to practice this stuff.

For me: Not worth the money, even on sale. To one-dimensional and boring.","Oct 23, 2019 at 1:51 PM",2, 15,"Hi!

Thank you for sharing this opinion with us. We are sorry to hear that you are not completely satisfied with our game, but we want to assure you that we are still working on Elven Assassin. 

In the future, we are going to add more content to make the game more interesting. You can expect new maps, new enemies, and fresh mechanics. 

Axes thrown by Orcs should fly straight into the player's head so that they can be avoided by bending or leaning to the sides. If this was not the case, it is very possible that you incorrectly set the floor level in Oculus. Please make sure that your floor level was set correctly. If so, let us know and we will try to solve this problem.

As for balancing the difficulty level, we will discuss it with the team. 

Also, we highly recommend trying out the multiplayer mode even with strangers. Multiplayer offers the possibility to play in co-op or PvP deathmatch mode. We hope you give Elven Assassin a second chance!

However, being disabled I am being killed far too often due to my inability to duck very far. There needs to be an optional button press for ducking.

Thank you for your comment. 

Have you tried to change the ""arrow offset"" option? It can help you with the right hand behavior when holding an arrow. If it doesn't help, could you tell us more about your problem?

2022-05-28 13:35:23.300485,FastLawyer,"Online Co-op is fun, SP not so much","This can be a fun game, especially playing online with a group of buddies or even a good group of 3 strangers and you (if you they use voice chat & are chill). However, there is very limited content. There's only 3 environments. There's really only a few enemy types. The higher level spells & any nice bow / armor takes a long time to unlock, so it does feel like a grind. However, the bow & arrow mechanic feels really good & polished. The graphics are nice.

Thank you for your opinion. We are sorry to hear that you do not like our game.

You said about the inability of turning and moving. For now, you cannot rotate and move by using controllers, because you have to do it in real life, but we will discuss this problem with the team. 

A few seconds in which you can't move is a punishment for not avoiding damage. This is the only punishment you can get in singleplayer mode for not avoiding an axe or dragon.

2022-05-28 13:35:26.466142,empirebeige,Poor Oculus Touch support,"Please note that Oculus Touch controllers are apparently not well supported in this game. The hands are tracked well but as soon as you use your hand to grab an arrow, the hand jumps up and no longer matches its actual position. The bow is then suddenly pointed downward. This makes shooting arrows awful, and since that is all you do in this game, it breaks the whole experience. Plenty of games do Touch support well for bows and arrows, but this is not one of them.

The gameplay is alright, though gets repetitive easily. But due to poor controller support I will be asking for a refund.","Nov 4, 2018 at 8:49 PM",2, 7,"Hi!

A game that is dedicated to bow shooting should do better than this.
you have a bow stuck in one hand and a arrow stuck in the other, so no quiver.
no special arrows or anything during or between the waves, so you can only uppgrade in the main menu store. Kinda kills the tower defence part of the game.

The rest of the game is clunky and scripted and does not at all make up for the poor bow mechanics, sounds and tower defence.

examples of games with more fun bow shooting mechanics:
The Lab,
Gorn,
Oculus Home (core 2.0),
Nvidia VR Funhouse,

Single player could use a little bit of love with the one map, but the multiplayer has like 4 or so. I would definitly reccomend playing online whenever you can. Theres a convenient PTT option too if you dont want people hearing you.

Only reason Im not giving a higher score is because I feel like im only experiencing half the game. There is a level system that lets you unlock spells for mulitiplayer, only Im not leveling up what so ever. I seem to be stuck at level 1. Ive played idk, 10-15 matches between single/multiplayer.

Also, the game sorely needs some kind of dedicated server, so there is always a multiplayer game to join. I have yet to see any games being available. The game seems to use the Windows default microphone setting, not the preference set in Oculus Home. Please fix that, or allow me to choose in game.

Indeed there was no magic in SinglePlayer but we have already added in the last update. As for the maps, there is currently 1 map on SinglePlayer and 2 maps on Multiplayer. We are very close to releasing the new location for both SinglePlayer and Multiplayer.

Multiplayer was working fine and it was fun for short time,  after 10 minutes it did not feel very exciting anymore and game play felt slow, also very generic enemy models do not really help to spice up things. 

First spell I got (fire) was very disappointing when it comes to visuals, like I was throwing a matchstick. Does not really give motivation to grind.

Steam version of this very same game is (at least currently) updated before Oculus Home  version, this leaves feeling like a secondary target audience, lesser valued customer.

Is it worth 10 dollars? If you are fine with waiting until more content comes or/and enjoy doing quick multiplayer matches. That said, it's still a ""good start"" and can be fun in short bursts, no doubt.

With few content updates and tweaks to spells (first level ones) could bring game to 4 stars easily,. Currently it's just too short and in early state to justice the asking price.","Apr 4, 2017 at 7:54 AM",2, 2,"Hi!

It does take a few rounds to get used to how to notch your arrow quickly and how best to aim, but it's very satisfying once you get it down. You can shoot the blue areas to teleport to them (strangely the instructions don't tell you this!) and that is key to stopping the later waves of monsters.

I've only played multi-player once but it was super fun. Push-to-talk works intuitively and you get a real sense of teamwork when defending the castle.

I highly recommend  having a room-scale setup and three sensors for this one. You can play without it but it is oh so much better with it. Incredibly immersive!

Steam I'm sure has a lot more money and development prowess, so I shouldn't expect that much, but this game cost money where as The Lab is free. This games content is about as diverse as The Lab's Longbow. 

Meaning as everyone else said, it's a tech demo that cost money.","Feb 6, 2017 at 4:32 AM",2, 0,"Hi!

Thank you for this comment. We want to inform you that the game has changed since then. We have added new spells, enriched multiplayer mode, improved graphics, enhanced game performance, and much more. I can reveal that we are planning even more changes in the near future. If you want, try it out and let us know what you think.

Once I learned how to switch to alternate places to shoot from, it added some strategy to the gameplay as I had to decide where to shoot from and when, to be succesful at stopping the waves of invaders. It's simple fun and it is my favorite touch game right now!","Dec 26, 2016 at 7:37 PM",5, 5,

Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that you did not quite like Elven Assassin. Since the publication of this review, we have added some things to the game that may interest you. New spells, better visuals, and enhanced performance are already waiting for you. In addition, multiplayer mode now offers co-op and PvP deathmatch. If you want, check the game and let us know what you think.

2022-05-28 13:36:07.648890,Arcradin,fun but needs a lot of work,"I like the interaction with the orcs, dragon, and ogre.. It really makes you feel like you are part of the game when they start attacking and that is important for VR because we all want to feel like we matter in the VR world and actually have a purpose for being in the VR world. There needs to be a difficulty option because single player is WAY too hard and its hard to find other players for multiplayer. The platforms you are standing on are big and it makes it very difficult to play if you dont have a lot of space. Also the aiming and speed of arrows seem off and should be looked at by the devs (Look for user N01773H review, he/she explains it better). This game is in alpha stage that was brought over here from steam. Just be careful when buying games on the oculus store because they dont tell you the status of the game. Lastly make sure to set up your sensors correctly for 360 tracking. Here is a guide made by oculus to set up 360 tracking: https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t39.2365-6/15397552_232732683816172_4121045365602385920_n.pdf","Dec 17, 2016 at 3:18 AM",2, 3,"Hi!

Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry that Elven Assassin did not fully meet your expectations. The size of the platforms depends on the map you are on and most of them are small, but we will discuss it with the team. The difficulty level is also something I will pass on to the team, but I can't promise if that will change. You also mentioned the shooting mechanics. Now the flight distance of the arrow changes depending on how much you pull the string. Moreover, we would like to inform you that we have managed to expand our game in other ways. Elven Assassin now offers much more interesting content. Now you can use ice spells, play PvP deathmatch on multiplayer and enjoy better graphics! Maybe give it a second chance and let us know what you think.

2022-05-28 13:36:10.814021,wilyrhino,Unsophisticated but addictive and smooth,I was rather bit smitten by The Lab's Longbow castle defense - this is basically exactly the same thing with a bit more complexity and much more elaborate graphics.  It's very very simple as a game but also really challenging and drives me to go again and again.  It was what I was hoping for and I hope they keep evolving the single player game and don't focus exclusively on MP.,"Dec 16, 2016 at 8:13 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 13:36:10.831973,N01773H,"Arrow physics lacking, no locomotion.","If you like archery games, consider skipping this one: especially if you only have a small play area. Plaforms you shoot from are too broad and with no way in game locamotion you can only fire at what you can see.

Arrows move at the same speed regardless of how hard you pull the string. All the string does is lob the arrow further. And I do mean lob, you will find you need to aim low as you will find your arrows travel slightly up as they leave the bow, even if you barely pull the string back.","Dec 19, 2016 at 10:41 AM",2, 3,"Hi!

Thank you for this opinion. Since your comment was made, the physics of the arrows has been changed. Now the distance to which the arrow flies depends on how tight the string is stretched. This does not apply to the Oculus Quest version due to hardware limitations. The size of the platforms depends on the map you are on. Some are larger, some are smaller. But thank you for this observation, we will discuss it with the team. In addition, many improvements and new features have been added to the game. We have added new spells, enhanced visuals, improved performance, and expanded multiplayer. So if you want to, you can check if you like the game more now.

There's only one level for single player (for now?) and two levels for multiplayer. Multi is also really cool, but people aren't playing much yet (one time I played with group of 3). 
You keep on trying to beat your own score, so it's really nice.","Dec 20, 2016 at 3:09 AM",5, 1,

It requires good communication and attention to be able to progress very far. VR is designed to be multiplayer, and this game pulls that off. It's obvious they're in their beginning stages, but the potential is astounding. I can't wait to see what other elements they add, but even now it's addicting as hell for me and a couple other guys. It was a good find. Don't hesitate if you have friends that will play the game with you.","Dec 17, 2016 at 2:43 PM",5, 1,

Since then our game has changed a lot, so there is a chance that this has already been fixed.
