2022-05-28 17:41:35.102817,MisjaKlomp,Gave me chills,"Magnificent experience with lovely storytelling. It seems greatly inspired by the work (and life?) of Rodin and has beautiful imagery and choreography in its dance sequences. It is somewhat interactive, which helps with the engagement, but most of its replayability will be found in being able to focus on the various wonderful details of the moving sculptures. As a lover of dance and sculpture, this experience seems like it was made just for me and it gave me chills (in a good way). I hope it will do the same for you!","Jul 26, 2020 at 4:35 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 17:41:38.252393,nrosko,Excellent,"If you liked La Peri you will like this. Same quality & passion put into this experience from the Firebird series. So i really look forward to more from this talented team. The experience is fairly short & there is some interaction,  i think its deffinately worth the money.","May 8, 2018 at 6:24 PM",5, 4,
