2022-05-28 19:25:33.481414,eliaslampinen37,moderate quality with a few problems,"I have played Bubmarine for 1.5 hours or less.
Graphics are simple, but the game feels somewhat OK. Steering however doesn't fully work. In Bubmarine player performs missions in an order, and there seems to be something like a story. In a mission there often a lot of space around, but there are boundaries, and the game usually doesn't provide reasons to explore, which is why the game ends up being played as if driving through a single tunnel.

Turning the sub left and right will probably cause me see nightmares after my first experience. The sub turns very slowly and often in the wrong direction, and there seems to be very little rule about it, except that turning hand right while holding the steering wheel is most likely to slowly turn the sub left, and turning hand to left increases probability of turning slowly right, but sometimes the only option is to wait until the sub has turned entirely around the wrong way (left), which is inconvenient when being under an attack. Also the game could be more pleasant with a clear audible English voice instead of repeated nonsense with a clear but fast text to read. Controlling the sub is done by handling virtual controls by virtual hands instead of physical buttons in controller, and I like that, despite it being more difficult than using the physical buttons would be.",Oct 31 at 4:09 PM,4, 0,

2022-05-28 19:25:33.512332,RCHeliz,Good but with flaws!,"Nice game but there is
one annoying bug, whenever I take off the headset and put it back on, the right robotic arm switches controls to headset direction. From hand control to headset movement. Can the devs chime in and tell me why does this happen?","Sep 21, 2019 at 2:06 AM",4, 2,

Initial Thoughts:
I found this little gem whilst browsing the Oculus library. It's been out for quite a while so I don't know how I missed it.
If you like underwater experiences in VR, you'll probably enjoy this. It's got a lot of variety, charm and is really well done.","Jun 21, 2019 at 11:23 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:25:33.542251,TerryTiger,,"Absolutely wonderful game!  Fun to play, easy to play, and great looking as well.  It's a wonderful underwater experience with gameplay.  Controls are simple and intuitive. This is not a violent ""shooter"" or anything serious at all, but is for ""children"" of all ages. I highly recommend it!","Jul 2, 2019 at 11:07 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:25:36.632985,Crazyhair,Super Fun!,"What a great game and hidden jewel.  The humor from the nutty inventer in this cartoon like world is perfect.  Unlike most games, this one has a training section to help learn things and then plenty of levels to play on after that. 
Plenty of action and searching throughout the game. 
Five stars out of me for the developers who created this!","Jan 8, 2019 at 4:55 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:25:36.647945,theawesometheory,Amazing Use of cockpit in VR,"This is the best use of touch controllers for a cockpit game that I have ever seen in a shipped title. Soundtrack is great. I'm only 4 levels in at this point, but I noticed there were no reviews so I HAD to leave one.","Apr 19, 2018 at 7:53 AM",5, 11,
