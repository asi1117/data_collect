2022-05-28 13:06:10.080634,anidleone,For the fans,"This is probably the best VR game i've ever played.
First, I need to clear some things out.
Don't seduce yourself by looking at the 1 star reviews too easily, they cover 2 basics things:

1: They complain by saying that they don't understand a thing. This is because most of them haven't played ANY of the Fnaf games. They just jump in strait in the VR version and confusion. Like seriously? There is a stradegy. Google it.

2. ""bugs"" Ok, this game had its fair shares of bugs and glitches, but nothing usual. Most of the people complain about their floor being too high, but thats their boundary setting.

My review:

This game is a blast. I am a long time FNAF fan and i've never played a FNAF game quite like this one. The stress of winding the music box as you constently spam the lights in order to check if anyone walks in, then seing bonnie starring at you in the vent so you quickly grab the mask in FNAF 2 is AMAZING! Perfect party game for halloween parties. There is nothing like FNAF gameplay. Sure, at first it might seem repetive, but its SO stressful in the first person. I was so scared the level I completed the most were the Parts and Services. Creepy!

And that feeling when you close the door right when foxy bumps it feels SO GOOD! The humor of handy unit is also very funny.

Overall, 4.9/5. One of the best VR horror titles i've ever played. 

2 things to do before buying:

1. Watch, learn, play the other FNAF games otherwhise phone guy is the only one giving you resourses.

2: Check if you have a big space to do stuff.

Best played with friends!",Dec 28 at 6:50 AM,5, 295,
2022-05-28 13:06:10.095102,GameRepeat,Good But Some Bugs,"This game is the best fnaf game ever.
But some of these rounds are way to hard.
One of them being Plushbaby, they all attack u at the same time and give u no chance in winning.

2022-05-28 13:06:13.297625,Bluescreen,Cons and pros,"Cons:

1. Graphics are very bad but there is only so much the quest 1 or 2 can do

2. Takes a while to download.

2 1/2. Too scary. It’s so scary that I don’t play it much. But this is only half a con because it was kinda intentional



Pros. 

1. It has the old game as well as some new ones.

2. It is scary so you do get bored

3. Lots of content and endings

4. It has a very good dlc just for 10$

5. Very cheap for a vr game

6. Can play on almost any console

Conclusion: it’s an amazing game that I would recommend if you have a vr system.",Nov 16 at 12:31 AM,5, 64,

I've even found myself going back to the old games to play them.

I completed the main game in about 2 days and absolutely recommend it, the full FNAF 1 - 3 games are recreated and FNAF 4 is partly recreated in the 'Night Terror' mini-games. I also enjoyed the secrets scattered here and there. (watch out for tapes) ;)

Whatever time of year it is I definitely recommend the Dreadbear Halloween DLC also. The new mini-games are very enjoyable! Only issue is I had to reinstall the entire game in order to get it working, but it wasn't too much hassle.","Mar 27, 2021 at 4:17 AM",5, 69,

2022-05-28 13:07:03.877964,DelapierceD,Expectations,"My biggest problem with this game is the trailer

It comes out of a popular series, so fans probably knew what they were getting into, but myself and presumably many others were fooled into thinking this was a fast-paced, story-driven horror series. The premise of working in a haunted Chuck E Cheese set my imagination going. And then... nothing happens...

The entire concept is to prevent the jump scare. You push a button to close a door, or turn on a flashlight, or you put on a mask. That is the entirety of the gameplay. There is no gameplay development. The one machine character is coming: Push the button. The other character is coming: Push the button. It is the beginning of the game: Push the button. It is the end of the game: Push the button

If they showed the actual gameplay experience as the trailer, it would better communicate this. I will say my first time playing was terrifying, though it wore off quickly. More scary under the influence. Probably worth on sale

Well, ya see humans need control for sanity that's why ""I'm out of control"" is such a horrible statement, but control is a illusion, it ain't real and fnaf will teach you it over and, over until you understand it and accept it. It will make you a stronger person, in real life. And it exercises your heart and lungs. I cannot recommend this enough, even if it is hard to actually scream, but trust me you will die inside.

Recently, I bought the Curse of Dreadbear DLC but the way to access the DLC is not appearing in game, which is very disappointing. There is a way to fix this issue, however. To make the DLC appear, you have to first uninstall FNAF VR, make sure you've purchased the DLC, then reinstall the game. After reinstalling, the DLC should be easily available, but you may lose your progress.

I loved the original couple games and was super into all of the fan theories and what not. When I heard Five Nights at Freddy’s was coming to VR I was thrilled, and was really excited to play one of my favorite childhood games in VR. I was a bit disappointed though that it was only coming to Rift as I only had a Quest. However with Oculus Link I was finally able to pick it up and give it a try! I am really glad I did, it’s like this game was truly made for VR. It’s incredibly immersive, the controls are intuitive, and it runs buttery smooth on my gaming laptop. I still can’t wait for it to run natively on the Quest in the future, but until then I am perfectly happy playing over Link.

2022-05-28 13:08:04.005078,Leo.Henriques,Best FNAF game ever!!!,"The mechanics are so good then any other VR game and it is pretty scary it is so scary that I could not have the courage to play some of the levels yet and there were others that were really easy and this takes FNAF to a hole new level and it is really realystic and the best thing is that you can see them moving and Phone Guy is here too!! And you can interact with almost every thing and there are some ""things"" that you have to do that aren't in the computer/mobile games (obviously beacause it is VR so you can do much more things) and each time you win a level you get a prize that can be received again in the prize counter you can win food, plushies, action figures and more but be aware that maybe you will be jump scared by plushtrap instead of winning a prize and you will encounter most of the animatronics (but not all) and it features FNAF 1 2 3 4 (wich in game is called night terrors) and some animatronics of SL (or Sister Location) and i have played FNAF 1 FNAF 2 FNAF 3 FNAF 4 SL (Sister Location) FNAF 6 FNAF World (wich isn't scary at all) UCN (or Ultimate Costume Night) and FNAF Help wanted, so if you want a very scary game then this game is right for you.

UPDATE:
The DLC just came out and I have to addmit it IS fun but it simply takes a lot to load the levels asside that the Curse Of Dreadbear DLC is super well made and fun but the Corn Maze mini-game is super hard and one last thing the DLC is the best one I've ever seen (at least of hallowen ones).

I've gotten a lot of snacks and drinks ready for that night, and I really don't want to disappoint them all, especially since a few of them I never get to see due to the amount of homework that you get in high school.

2022-05-28 13:08:10.373307,CarterOJ,Updates? DLC?,"It seems like the people who bought this game on the oculus store are getting screwed over. We all paid full price for this game and not only are we not getting the latest patches, we also can't get the new DLC, The Curse of Dreadbear. I'm not about to pay another $40 on steam so I can play the stupid DLC. This kinda sucks, ngl. 

UPDATE: Okay so the DLC did eventually come out (which I am happy about) but the only thing that bothers me is that Steelwool released the DLC to Oculus about a week after steam users got the DLC. Now this wouldn't have been a problem for me if Steelwool had actually thought to notify us of this delay instead of keeping us in the dark the whole time. Aside from the horrible customer service and the lack of attention steelwool has for the oculus version of this game, I will say that this game is truly stunning. Its scary, creepy, and all around just a fun game to play through. Although, something that needs to be fixed in this game are the extremely long wait times oculus players have when loading up a minigame in The Curse Of Dreadbear DLC. It takes a ridiculous amount of time to load just about anything within the DLC itself (especially Pirate Ride). As of now, I am giving this game 3 stars only because of the lack of attention that the Oculus version of this game has gotten from its developers. Once I see that this game is recieving steady updates that correlate with steam's updates, I will change the rating to 5 stars (becuase this game really is fantastic).

- Contains some interesting lore, though not as much as the other games in the series.
- Overall fun while remaining terrifying.

Bad/Bugs:
- (minor) Showtime button still doesn't work
- Certain buttons (FNAF 1 lights, FNAF 2 music box) are difficult to switch on/off most of the time.
- Some games not explained how to play properly.

2022-05-28 13:08:45.212936,Zarehl,,"I've only played the game for about an hour, so this will be more of a first impressions type of review.

In a nutshell, I'm very pleasantly surprised. The series, for better or worse, is known for its jump scares, so I went into this with zero knowledge of the franchise and average expectations, and was instead met with a rich environment and very clever atmospheric design. Jump scares aren't a cheap trick to arbitrarily electrify the experience, but rather are consequences of your own actions. Instead, the game primarily tests your psychological resilience and composure.

To illustrate, FNAF 1 casts you as a security guard for the Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria (think Chuck E Cheese, but a weird hell version). You control doors, lights, and can swap between cameras on a feed to get views around the facility. The phone rings and a it's a former employee walking you through your first night, saying everything's cool, everything's fine, just sit there and watch the feeds, and save power while you're at it. Don't mind the roaming animatrons. They'll just forcibly stuff you into a robot suit if they see you.

In the meantime you hear all these spoopy noises - at which my first reaction was to shut the doors. Which is the thing. You're supposed to use the lights and doors to check your surroundings and ward off the wandering killer animal robots, but you need to do this as efficiently as possible, or else you run out of power before the shift ends and the doors and lights stop working, leaving you completely at their mercy.

This means actively looking around in the dark and trying to strain your ears over the phone recording, while also trying to absorb its legitimately helpful advice, to see and prepare for anything approaching. So whether or not you're necessarily willing, the game forces you to engage the creepy environment in a meaningful way to be successful.

If the other FNAFs in the game are as cleverly designed as this first scenario, I'm all in.","May 29, 2019 at 1:32 PM",5, 261,

2022-05-28 13:08:57.934274,shrunknee,Utterly horrifying,"I'm a big fan of horror movies and games so for me to say this is the scariest piece of media I have ever consumed is certainly worth something. Right from the menu I knew I was in for a treat. I had previously played all 5 FNAF games and really enjoyed them, however after about an hour of playtime the jumpscares got old and the 2D flatness of everything didn't really leave much atmosphere or tension. In VR this is a different story. Everything is rendered in full 3D and as such you really feel like you're there. In other VR games theres almost always something that breaks yout total immersion, whether it be bad graphics, bugs, artificial movement, or any number of other factors. In this game, you are planted into a chair in a security office, in front of a broken animatronic, in a hallway, or in a vent. Because of this you really begin to lose sense of your surroundings and become 100% immersed in the game which is something very few other games have done properly. Having that type of immersion in a game like this is key to the tension, build-up and eventually the scares that follow. What began as a horror game is now in your mind your reality. You are here, the animatronics are out to get YOU. This sense of realism really seals the deal like no other game I've played has, and I've often found myself having to take off the headset and remind myself that it's just a game in between levels. The use of jumpscares could be called cheap but the build up to them pays off in the end, not to mention that unlike other horror games, getting jumpscared is not ever forced on you. All the scares are a result of your own failure and that makes them feel a lot more intense and less like a cheap fright. This game is phenomenal for horror fans and VR fans alike and I highly recommend that you give it a go. 10/10 Game.","May 31, 2019 at 2:31 PM",5, 12,

Sure there's some minor bugs here and there, but it's NOTHING compared to how some games are released nowadays. Definitely a full fledged game with a bunch secrets to be found all over again. Fairly polished and deserving of a 5 star.
I never write reviews. So... take it from me that it's good, even good enough to get me writing this. Also don't play this game at 2AM with the lights shut. That I would not recommend. :D","May 29, 2019 at 1:56 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 13:09:01.065526,taquitobuddy,Confusing rather than scary,"Having never played a FNAF game before, playing the 1st night of FNAF1 in VR left a great impression originally.  Unfortunately almost everything was downhill from there.  The first game is definately the best of them, though still confusing and poorly explained.  Why are the cameras sometimes showing still-images only, and sometimes moving ones?  What do you do about the pirate fox?  Why is the guy on the phone STILL talking but not telling me anything useful?  

The 2nd and 3rd games are much worse, especially the 3rd where you're giving absolutely no idea what is going on/how to play and you seemingly can't die/lose, so just stand there rebooting the virtual PC for 15 minutes until 6am.  There's several other mini-games, but only the Parts and Repair is fun, but not very challenging and too short.  All the ""scares"" in all of these games lose their effect almost immediately.

Overall, for $5 or less might be worth picking up to demo/scare people, or if you are someone who is frightened of being confused by unexplained gameplay mechanics and a guy taking non-stop on the phone for hours, THIS is your game.","Jun 10, 2019 at 7:46 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 13:09:01.083478,Allen_Scott,Outstanding horror,"I jumped in expecting a quick cash grab from scott and steel wool, I was proved wrong after a couple rounds of the FNAF 1, 2 and 3 nights.
The game does a great job of marginallising you as a simple nightguard, as these 7""2 animatronics stomp around you. it does an awesome job of portraying the true horror a nightguard in the pizzeria. The other gamemodes, like parts and service and vent repair, are exhilarating, pushing the limits of someones capability to handle stress well. great build and quality, really polished game, and the part other reviews overlook is the secrets, with hidden Fazcoins and tapes dotted around, this game will keep you occupied for a very long time, worth the cash!","Jul 9, 2019 at 12:10 AM",5, 1,

You really don’t have to be a horror enthusiast to enjoy this game.  The game mechanics are very balanced and I think this is one of those games which you can’t really get sick of. All my friends love this game and even though it has its flaws, it’s a fun experience nonetheless. I know I’m a bit naïve to give a review on a game, but I really think this one deserves it.

2022-05-28 13:09:04.237619,Neuramir,Terrifyingly Awesome,"The original games were already scary, but in VR, every moment from when you start and end the game puts the fear of god in you.
It plays and looks crisp, and there are little to no bugs. Every mode is fun and enjoyable, and the story is pretty good.
Freddy and his other animatronic pals are creepy and horrifying, especially since 80% of the time your in darkness and you can't see their whole body.
The only thing I don't like is that if you don't have prior knowledge about the Fnaf games, your completely screwed when you start playing, but to be fair most consumers who buy the game already probably know or have seen how the game works.","Jun 30, 2019 at 6:17 AM",5, 2,

Within this game you get FNAF 1-5 along with some other puzzle rooms that are horrifying. In the original games, the characters appeared static in most cases and you were stuck in one place in the first few games. In this game, the ability to move freely and close doors, push buttons, etc is far more immersive than I could have ever imagined. I still can't get over the size of the characters in this game. All in all, the original games didn't scare me too much, but prepare to be absolutely horrified!","Jul 1, 2019 at 10:26 AM",5, 1,

FNaF Help Wanted is a great and realistic experince. The gameplay in the game
felt fluid and atleast wen i got it i did not run in to any bugs, But with some levels not holding up after the first time playing it. For example the baby game. I found myself shouting at it telling Baby, ""Hey dingus im here"" and other things. But with games like the classic originals that still hold up after 20 times playing nigth 5 fnaf 1 over and over... Yeah the game is bloody amazing, the most unseteling part of the game was ""Glitch Trap"" or ""Virus"", he watches you the whole game and the closer he got the more I started peeing my pants. And the pizza party minigame felt so weird, ""You're a seven year old kid stuck in the haunted pizzeria and the purple guy leads you back stage stuffing you in a freddy suit, then you see your murdurer dancing away..."" 10/11 best game - IGN","Jul 5, 2019 at 1:31 AM",4, 1,

Yes it has some glitches, but Steelwool has been working very hard to fix them. Just a quick warning: be prepared for Dark Rooms, FNAF1, and the final minigame. Also the graphics are insanely terrifyingly great. It's so scary to see the animatronics (especially in FNAF1) walking.

I didn't know what to expect when I saw this game, but decided to try it out as something different for the VR.  The main game has a variety of different levels to play at your own liking.  The game has several familiar levels from FNAF 1, 2, and 3.  Even though they were the same, the VR and style makes them feel like a new game.  Beyond that you have some unique levels that require you to think on your feet.  The unkowns in these levels make them a lot of fun.  Some of the collectables are hard to reach for, but overeall I felt everything was within my reach.  You can play this game sitting down, but it's more enjoyable standing up and looking around the environment.
