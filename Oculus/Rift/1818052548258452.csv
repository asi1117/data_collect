I appreciate the effort put in to getting evrything together, but the experience itself needs some work. It wasnt the best quality, and crashed alot. I would have liked more interaction while watching the video like being able to pause and move around, and I would have liked to be able fast forward and rewind. I did love how on the third location you could put on a cowboy hat, and wished you did something similar on all of them. I feel that older people and schools would enjoy this and use this experience for teaching and learning, but for people that dont just like sitting there and watching videos it should have had more things to do while watching for a more iteractive viewer.","Oct 16, 2020 at 3:55 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:31:53.985902,BDSVR05,"Great experience, but it keeps crashing.","Living With Jaguars is a great, eduacational game, but the game has too many bugs. First off, whenever I was watching one of Rafael's videos, the game kept freezing. Also, it crashes way too much. I had to restart my game about 4-5 times, and it would never fix the problem. On the bright side though, it has so many facts, that I bet a teacher could give a whole lesson on what the game taught you. In the end, Living With Jaguars is a fun, educational game, but it has way too many bugs.","Oct 16, 2020 at 3:52 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:31:54.001860,BDSVR08,Viewing Jaguars in Virtual Reality,"I found the ""Living with Jaguars"" simulator to be a very imforative experience. While I was familar with Jaguar poaching that took place years ago, I did not know I countinued today, I was unaware of the cattlemens involment and that it still countinues today. The imformation was portrayed in an interesting and investing way with out being over the top nor annoying. While some the video could be fuzzy, it really didn't take away from the exersise. I enjoyed the video pryoritzed making sure to make anyone seem like a villian, al least for modern situations. I see no major flaws, an enoyable experience all around.","Oct 16, 2020 at 3:55 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:31:54.016820,BDSVR03,Jaguars Might Go Extinct!,"My oculus expierence with living with jaguars was a very educational expierence. I liked how instead of humans having to follow the jaguars around instead they had camoflouge cameras. With those cameras they could track their movement in the night and during the day without having to see them and make them feel uncomfortable. Although I feel that they need to tell you a little more about the jaguars themselves and their habitat and how they live. I also had a few technical difficulties like at the beggining the sound was very quite even turned all the way up. I also had a few glitches. My overall expierence was great and I now know that if we do not be more careful, percautious and well educated about jaguars they could go extinct.","Oct 16, 2020 at 3:49 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:31:54.032777,BDSVR04,Jaugars are endangered!,I really thought the game demostrated what was happening in the jaugars community and the problems that are occuring with in it. Although I have notice some bugs and very fustrating features I have noticed that when I exited the game to do another task  that the game closes this is very fustrating to deal with. Another glitch that I have come across is the crashing I experince it alot and it was hard to deal with. Now I think I should adress some of the mechanics of the game that I think should be adressed. The holding mechnaic needs work when I went to go grab stuff It was sometimes hard to reach to improve this you can enable a feature they allows you to point press the grab keybind and it brings it to you. Besides all that you guys have showed me your message and what your trying to get at ive have realised the danger that these poucher are bringing to our jaugars in all I somewhat enjoyed my experince thats where the three stars come from.,"Oct 16, 2020 at 3:53 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:31:57.140465,BDSVR02,Jaguar saftey!,My oculus experiance was amazing I got see how the jaguars lived and how the workers kept  tract of the jaguars that passed by the camera they hid in camouflage. I also learned that the cattlemen used to kill the jaguars so that they could take them back home and show that they will do anything to protect their cattle. One thing I did not like was that when you made it half way through the video the whole platform would shut down. It also had a few glitches and it was blurry in some of the videos. Other than those few problems I learned many new things about jaguars and how they are valuable to nature.,"Oct 16, 2020 at 3:56 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:31:57.155425,BDSVR01,Living with Jaguars Review,"I really enjoyed this app. It tought me a lot about jaguars and how farmers killed them not for fun but to protect their live stock. And it also was pretty cool how it has become a thing people will go and pay a lot of money to just see jaguars. My one problem though was, on the jaguar section, I did not get to watch any of the videos because it kept freezing. But, over all it was really cool and interesting.","Oct 16, 2020 at 3:48 AM",4, 1,
