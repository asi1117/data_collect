I'd probably give it 3-4 stars compared to much more expensive Kart sims but 5 stars because it costs about 1/10th the price of those.","May 23, 2020 at 9:17 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:10:42.339898,Spalman_yt,Pleasantly surprised,"I decided to buy this Cart game because it was one of the cheapest, and I must say that I am satisfied. The reduction of the FOV really helps in preventing from getting motion sickness.
Some people would call the graphics cheap, but they remind me of Mario Kart 64. This, plus the music really presents some nostalgia and I like it.
The only thing that bugs me is the stiff atmosphere. The game just feels very mechanical/dead. You know in Mario Kart, when the CPU players make noise and shout ""Yay"" or ""Woo"", they laugh or interact with their surroundings? These elements are missing here. Other than the engine sound and the background music, there is not much SFX. Maybe the developer wanted to make the animals as authentic as possible, but I do think that at least some sounds would improve the experience.
I think if this game gets more inspiration from other Cart games in terms of atmosphere, it could easily be one of the best valued games on here.
Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend it.","Dec 21, 2019 at 5:30 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:10:42.355856,ARMOR210,Love this Game!!!,"Totally worth the $5. Fantastic VR adaption! One of my biggest gripes about VR games is no Jump button, this a Kart racing game has a JUMP button! How cool is that?!!! I gave a 5 * because it's a great value buy. It would be even better if it could do online multiplayer!!! Good job dev's, keep up the good work!!!  ;)","Sep 18, 2019 at 12:32 AM",5, 5,Thank you so much for trying out my little game! It always makes my day when someone tells me that they had fun playing it! :)
