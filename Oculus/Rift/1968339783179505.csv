2022-05-28 19:43:39.700838,TillitDevon,Nice adventure into the past!,"Played the game a couple of hours now and after small problems with the rift sensors at the beginning no further problems occured. It's a great experience to explore the different levels and experience ammonoids, trilobites and of course the dinosaurs!","Jan 22, 2020 at 2:44 AM",5, 5,

Was able to hear something talking but could not get out. Reset twice  before realizing to stay still till back door opened to continue . Good start.","Nov 6, 2019 at 8:28 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:43:39.731755,Crazyhair,Don't waist your money,"I bought this because the Devs had stated they fixed the problems! Wrong! Every time I move the thumb stick to look around (while on flat ground) trying to move I get sent back to the beginning of the sequence. I then have to go through all the same obstacles all over again, over and over. So I tried to not use the stick, but that's impossible. I finally got to use the vines and climb the mushrooms for which I understand if you fall you die and start again which is different. But still for this kind of experience....why must you die and start again. Take a lesson from Nature Treks. It has 100 times the quality at half the price. 
I bought this to relax, but so far all I get is irritation, over and over again. What a POS!","Oct 22, 2019 at 3:45 AM",1, 4,"Hello Crazyhair,

We are sorry you had a bad experience with our game. So far we couldn't reproduce the problem you describe. A possible solution might be to change your input method in the options. 

We also offer a climbing mode that doesn't reset you to the start when you fall. You can find it under ""Easy Climb"" in the game options. 

You can always contact us at info@timetransitvr.com so we can find a solution. Please provide your system specs and what device you are using so we can get back to you as soon as possible.

Kind Regards"
2022-05-28 19:43:39.745718,ALESSIO63,Engaging Game,"Nice game. High quality. There is a progressive immersion in the story, simple problems to solve and a little robotic assistant with you. I remember an old cd-rom in 1997, a masterpiece titled ""The origin of life"" from Microfolie's, with the same scenario and creatures. A deep emotion for me to live this immersive experience. Thank you.","Jul 7, 2019 at 5:08 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:43:39.761676,Mutrino,Needs work,I have a GTX1070 and i7-6700HQ. This certainly meets the minimum performance requirements. Performance even at lower graphical settings is just terrible. Unplayable at high or epic.  When you quit a chapter the game does not save your progress and you will start the chapter from the beginning which gets tedious very fast. I like the concept of the game but the performance issues are a killer. Certainly not worth the price. Will probably refund.,"Jun 11, 2019 at 2:52 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 19:43:42.875466,theregoes2,Would be more stars if it weren't buggy,"UPDATE: I tried this again last night and it didn't crash, but whatever is making the screen go dark is still happening.

Every time I loaded a new environment it would be bright and gorgeous, but then everything would go dark, like the game was paused or something. To fix it I just had to leave and come back, but it would just happen again. Also, when I was in the Jurassic taking pictures of dinos the game crashed and I had a Fatal Error message waiting for me when I took the headset off. If this stuff gets patched up then I'd give another star or two because aside from these issues, it was awesome","Apr 14, 2019 at 11:03 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:43:42.891423,thumbtackVR,"Great Game, One of my Favorites","This game is awesome. You climb on tress, rocks, and all sorts of things to look at the views. You can see all sorts of animals, mostly dinosaurs, which look great and well textured. A tour guide helps you along the way, and there is a story to each of the two parts. I ran this on High and Epic settings with a GTX 1060 3B and Core I5 8400, it ran quite nicely. Please do not let the price point turn you away, this is a great experience. The only thing I noticed that was a little off was tiny pieces of terrain in some parts were clipped - only a few times on the second story, not a big deal. 5 Stars.","Mar 21, 2019 at 9:07 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:43:42.906383,ParadiseDecay,1st Impressions Video + Commentary!,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACfGY8cP5kM (Please Note: Links might not work from Oculus so please search YouTube for 'Paradise Decay VR Time Transit VR' Thank you)

PLEASE NOTE: I had the developers in my chat during my LIVE Premiere, they are constantly looking at ways to improve the game and have told me the game is about 8-10 hours long.

My Quick Thoughts:
I had quite a few performance issues on my GTX 1060 in some of the locations, turning my settings to Low did help, but not good enough to keep the experience smooth.
The performance hits seemed to happen when loading in a new location and based on my initial impressions I would say a more powerful GFX card is required beyond the recommended minimum specs for the best experience.
I enjoyed the worlds and locations that I explored and the AI was very well done. Textures and animations we're superb and I enjoyed the thrill of discovering new elements like climbing and ziplines. Also having watched the trailer it seems there is also a Canoe section.
The tools you had on offer to play around with are really cool and the atmosphere really added to the sense you we're on a radical time traveling tour, so well done devs for pulling that off superbly!
I hope the experience does well and I will be keeping my eye on it. My only fear is the price might steer a lot of people away. If this is YOU, add this to your wishlist and maybe wait for it in a sale.
I never did come across any bugs, but I did get stuck at one point trying to climb down a rockface and I hope they add some more optimisation for lower range cards.","Feb 28, 2019 at 5:24 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 19:43:42.921343,Clu,Very cool game just needs a few things.,"Colors are fairly washed out looking, Falling could use a little more time to fall before reset since it makes it so you cant swing yourself without starting over and it has crashed several times on a i7-6700k gtx 1070 16gb ddr4. The game itself is very relaxing and unique for VR. There are many good things the game has to offer currently like zip lines, climbling, feeding dinosaurs, a good amount of freedom to explore.","Mar 9, 2019 at 1:36 PM",3, 1,
