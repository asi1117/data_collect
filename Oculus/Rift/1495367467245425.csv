2022-05-28 15:01:06.362654,RuneSR2,Beyond awesome - a Rift must-have!,"There're not many hoverbike games in VR, and this one truly shines. Kinda feels like a first person shooter on a hoverbike in a post Mad Max world. Flying around destroyed and rusty spaceships decaying on the ground and being immersed in this futuristic world is one of the best VR experiences I ever had. There's simply nothing like it - sure you can get something different in VR, but you can't get something better ;-) The music blows my mind everytime - probably my favorite music in any VR game. Maybe this game is for seasoned VR users, but take it slow and let the VR legs grow - for this game is exactly why you want to grow those VR legs. I'm confindent that ASW 2.0 works like a charm in this game - I've maxed out all graphics settings, even 8xMSAA, and I force super sampling 2.0 using Oculus Tray Tools - still it feels like perfect 90 fps, I'm in awe how the devs have optimized this game. Textures are close to being photo-realistic, I guess you could say that this game is as good as it gets in every way and it'll totally blow your mind!","Jun 20, 2019 at 4:38 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:01:06.377615,Gecko-VR,It's good for 2 minutes.,"I've played a lot of VR games, and a huge indicator of if a game will be good or not is depending on how much detail the developer puts into the hands you have in game. Well in this game, there is none. From the start, you can't open or close your hand, and there appears to be only one voice actor for the whole game who tries to sound like an AI with a scottish accent who talks way to much. You load into the main menu and you just hear, ""GrOuNd RuNnEr: TrIaLs!!! MaIn MeNu !! sElEcT lEvEl!!"" by the worst voice actor ever.

There is literally only one or two sound effects for shooting and explosions and they don't even sound good. Visuals, sound design and content all fail as you are literally doing repetitive missions on the same map.

The only good part about this game that makes it worth playing for two minutes is the driving mechanics. You're not using the thumbsticks, you grab an in game handle push if forward to thrust, back to reverse, and side to side to turn. It's really satisfying and feels like you're driving a stick motorcycle/waverunner thing. After a while I keep finding myself getting motion sick after about 15 minutes of game time.

So, if you must; buy it and play for two minutes then refund it. It's not worth keeping.","Apr 21, 2019 at 4:53 AM",1, 10,

Not sure if I want to - I probably *should* be feeling a bit ill if I'm making rapid turns and thrusts at high speed while shooting enemies with the off hand!

I've only played the first 3 levels, and I've gotta say, I'm blown away. This is *exactly* what I wanted from VR: immersion, a challenge that requires coordination, and music that keeps the adrenaline going. Also, there's something that's just very satisfying about strafing at high speeds and blasting away enemies.

Love the concept, the flying controls are very intuitive, shooting seems like a classic arcade feel.
Somehow the view calibration is set to 90 degrees clockwise from how I usually sit and this can't be corrected, (not even when I try reset view in Oculus home) so -1 for that because I now have a chair in the middle of my livingroom :P Devs, please fix ;)

At times the guns won't holster and I have to try 10-20 times before it works, also the flight hand (right one) glitches like crazy from time to time, not often but when it does it's fecking annoying.
I guess it's called ""early access"" for a reason, right :D

They've got the controls spot on as quite quickly it all becomes quite intuitive, zipping around and aiming a handheld weapon all at once.. It actually feels like you are riding a hoverbike (not that I've ever ridden a real one LOL): great stuff.  Amazing to think that this is developed by such a  small team.. I'm certainly looking forward to what else these guys come up with.  The scenery is all really well crafted and it's clear a lot of effort has been put into the details and even more amazing when you think that it's still in early dev.  I think this game sets the bar for a new generation of made for VR games as you really can't do this type of game properly in non-VR.  Top marks!","Feb 17, 2018 at 1:21 AM",5, 3,

This game that's what. It's about time!
Looks great, the controls are intuitive and feel so natural.
You get fast, full locomotion and I have had no nausea at all.
Flying round on a hoverbike with vertical lift using only the right hand touch controller is just genius. Then throw in shooting your laser gun with the left touch, like some kind of space cowboy!
Want two guns? No problem just let go of the throttle, stop flying and grab a second! It is incredibly fun and well executed

Elite Dangerous is my go-to game and does similar things when I am in the SRV (buggy) but it has settings to lock the horizon and that almost totally cures my motion sickness. Hopefully we get someting along these lines soon. I only managed to complete the first training mission before I needed a lie down LOL. Only really kicked in when I was allowed STRAFE. Graphically, it is very nice indeed from the very short intro I have had. The bike is realised beautifully, you can almost beleive you are sat in a hoverbike. Touch controls are used rather than joystick or gamepad which is brilliant, and they work really well.

Great first effort, looking forward to future updates.","Feb 24, 2018 at 2:04 AM",4, 2,

It's the only VR game that does this to me, including games with smooth locomotion (Mostly Onward, that I play a lot and never makes me sick). It's probably the speed of the movement that ends up making me sick, I'm unsure what can be done about it.

Just a quick update. I saw a YouTube video where the bike was swaying from left to right and back again. I thought it was an oversteer problem and was worried when I experienced the same thing. However, after a while playing I found that this was happening because I had allowed the hand holding the controller to drop lower down.

The first thing that strikes you about this game is the stunning location and graphics. The Plasma bike looks and feels amazing, controls are fluid, spontaneous, intuitive and exhilirating. The sensation of hovering, banking and turning at speeds and later in the game flying is incredible. I was in my element throughout my initial 1st experience as this is the type of game I have been looking for in VR for a long time. At this moment in time I cannot praise this game enough and what a SHOW STOPPER to show your friends. Overall it's highly polished and a joy to play AND still in early access. When a game like this comes along and surprises you, it makes me very excited for the potential and possibilties of VR. This is a 2017 gem you do not want to miss.

I bought it immediatly but can't start it. Any ideas?,"Dec 27, 2017 at 8:52 AM",5, 0,Hey thanks Turnburn. This game only works on the Oculus Rift CV1 HMD. Are you trying to run it on the Lenovo HMD? That would be the problem I think. Sorry to hear you can’t run it right now.
