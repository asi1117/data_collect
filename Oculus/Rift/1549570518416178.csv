2022-05-28 19:04:19.712291,RuneSR2,New patch fixed this game for me,"Game has gotten much better with the latest 1GB patch, is the draw distance now the same as the launch version? 
At least performance seems never to have been better.
Fugl requires a 64-bit 4+ core processor, but using my i7 7700+ cpu (4 cores, 4.5 GHz) I had no problem getting solid 90 fps even with all graphics (view distance) maxed. I also cranked up super sampling to 2.0 and still got solid 90 fps. Fugl isn't much of a game, maybe it's more an experience - or even a tech demo, because you simply fly and experience the different worlds and landscapes (or swim as a fish). Fugl is a Nordic word meaning ""bird"". In Fugl you transform into other life forms when you fly next to them - maybe the flying monkey is taking the logic a bit too far, but it's fun becoming a butterfly, bat or other birds (or fish). 
Maybe $15 is a high price for the limited and repetitive experience, but the voxel worlds simply look fantastic. Personally I find Fugl a great way to relax - and kids won't have much trouble controlling and enjoying Fugl too.  Touch works nicely like a gamepad. Fugl is a highly recommended VR experience.","Apr 16, 2020 at 2:39 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 19:04:19.741213,SnowUse,Dead Bird,"My bird flies into a downward spiral no matter what i do. When i go to controls, its like something is pushing it to the left and holding it. I have tried several other games/ input testing and every other controller option. Update: Months later. Every possible input, Unplugged everything, restarted, updated. this game simply will not run for me. My controls work on every other game. This one reads a left input even with nothing synced.","Dec 17, 2019 at 2:14 PM",1, 0,

My Quick Thoughts:
Fugl is not an action packed game, it's one of wonder and exploration. It has a really unique voxel artstyle which feels great in VR as you soar through the worlds in search of all the creatures to morph into.","Jul 12, 2019 at 2:57 PM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 19:04:19.771133,eminus,Relaxing flight and beautiful biomes,Fugl is a treasure.  A game that doesn't have a million rules or play mechanics.  You fly around different biomes and morph into flying creatures along your journey.  You do this to soothing ambient music.  This game has helped me to relax from stressful days and unwind my brain from complexities.  I highly recommend it to anyone that is tired of shooters and high octane games and just needs some time to relax and take flight.,"Jul 12, 2019 at 7:32 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 19:04:22.875829,Fuzzydragon,4 stars but it's not the games fault,"It's yours because this game is not what your looking for, there is no story or game here only a basic colectathon but if you just came to soar like a pixalated eagle or flit like a butter fly through endless randomized world to chill out then you wont find a better one in vr.","Jul 31, 2019 at 9:16 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:04:22.892784,ccdeltabeta,A Bird-Based 'Pilotwings' Game (kind of),"Response to Developer:  Increasing the Turn Speed only seemed to enable the bird to get out of my FOV faster.

Original Review: The other reviews are spot on for the kind of game/experience it is; wide-open areas to fly around in, take in the sights, and relax (a VR Sunday Drive, for old timers). No goals, no objectives, no worries. A great way to wind down a VR session.
The graphics are simplistic, but leave no doubt about what you are seeing.  It is probably due to the simple nature of the graphics that I am allowed to increase the Draw Distance to the maximum, and have no performance issues (i7-8700, 16GB RAM, GTX 1070Ti).
What i do have an issue with is the following: (1) The inability to lock your position behind the bird. So, effectively, although you control the bird, too wide of a turn, and you will have to physically turn to keep track of the bird.  Otherwise, the bird will fly out of your field of view, and you will be confused as to what happened, and why you seem to keep crashing into things without knowing where your bird is at. (2) A 1st-person view, for myself, would add a lot of immersion and control.  I enjoy the casual flying around, but there are times I want to see how well I can fly (as compared to how well I can control the bird).
I saw this game as being what I wish Eagle Flight could have been (thank goodness this game has no blnders when turning), and it almost works for me, minus the issues described above.
Fixing these control issues would easily take it to a 4 or 5 star game.","Aug 23, 2019 at 12:55 PM",3, 0,"1) Try incrreasing turn speed in options->gameplay. I might want to increase the maximum there. Send me an email: fugl.game@gmail.com.
2) It's coming, but hard to get right."
2022-05-28 19:04:22.907744,Seeknoise,Beautiful and relaxing,"This is a really tranquil experience which should appeal to anyone who just likes exploring a landscape. In addition to morphing into lots of different types of birds, you can also morph into various types of fish and swim around underwater, and other types of animals.

The graphics and audio are really lovely and relaxing, and the controls are pretty intuitive and easy to use.

This is definitely something I'll be coming back to play more of, especially now that I noticed in the trailer/description that you can find mythical creatures!","Jul 13, 2019 at 1:25 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:04:22.922704,NeoEdo,"I'm not sure what I accomplished, but...","THANK YOU!
I purchased this game lastnight. Without even reading up on it. It just looked like a, ""I need to purchase this"", kind of game. It looked relaxing, perhaps.
I was finally able to try it out tonight after work. THIS is exactly what I needed to relax with. Work has been awful, as of late; I'm now excited to have something that will clear my mind if even for a quick hour or so.
Very beautiful and intriguing game!","Jul 13, 2019 at 1:38 PM",5, 3,
