I've seen all the other coaster games that are available and this was one of the best. Kinda makes me wonder if they're being paid by competitors to give bad reviews. And fyi people if it makes you queasy don't play. It's a coaster game for crying out loud.","Jan 5, 2021 at 8:45 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 14:14:35.681086,Lotalu,Space is no place for a coaster,Compared to other coaster games I have played this is pretty meh. Space also is no ideal place for a rollar coaster because you have no sense of your position above the ground.,"Dec 1, 2020 at 6:22 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 14:14:35.696551,Sven-85,Cosntant speed shifts break immersion,"I guess the coasters speed is internally recalculated every 2 seconds. At least what I see is that the coaster slows down over 2 seconds and then gets a noticable boost - this loops repeats during the whole ride. It feel slike being kicked around, and it totally breaks immersion. :-/","Oct 5, 2020 at 10:19 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 14:14:35.711512,kagalive85,"Not Amazing, but Not Terrible","A fairly standard rollercoaster experience. Nothing spectacular here but the graphics are nice, it's a shame everything either takes place in a macro-scale (space) or a micro-scale (outdoors/room). You don't really get a sense of vertigo, well at least I didn't. 

The room rollercoaster was by far the best but also the shortest. 

The experiences, combined, make for around 12.5 minutes of entertainment, they aren't really amazing enough to revisit, except perhaps after a significant amount of time has passed, so replayability is pretty low for me. 

Grab this one on sale. 3/5","Aug 25, 2020 at 9:13 AM",3, 14,

2022-05-28 14:14:38.900576,hybridview,A change of title perhaps.,"If you want to *calmly* soar through cool environments while listening to nice music (the music fits my tastes, but maybe not for others), then this is your game. As other reviewers have stated, there is no roller coaster physics in this game, but that is what I like about it. It's more like a powered glider ride on autopilot. I have another roller coaster game that I use for thrilling rides, but when I want to relax, I fire this game up.  Movements are very calm and relaxing, and the environments are well designed and interesting.  You will be disappointed if you think of this as a standard roller coaster sim. The only thing I would change about this game is maybe the title, as people expect a roller coaster type ride.","Mar 29, 2020 at 6:54 AM",5, 23,
2022-05-28 14:14:41.970953,goesBang,"Boring, no roller coaster feeling","You ""fly"" through 4 scenes with a complete static background, lots of static objects and some moving objects - and some boring relaxation music. Each course is like 3-4 minutes long.
I just went through them all and it was boring. I could stand without problems and am not even slightly uncomfortable - there is no roller coaster feeling.
A major problem is, that the speed is quite constant - you don't feel the speed in the large scale scenes. The last room scene was the best one in this regard and also with the follwing issue:
The vehicle tilt is often the same, even through tight curves - it just doesn't feel like a roller coaster.

Sometimes I just wished for a weapon and that I could shoot out of this vehicle - but no hand tracking either. ;)","Dec 7, 2019 at 3:42 AM",2, 16,

You're just floating around  and the track isn't really fixed. Feels like the car ""sucks in""  the rubberbandlike track. Terrible sound as well. A quick uninstall.","Oct 14, 2018 at 1:54 AM",2, 10,

Almost all tracks just start very fast without any of the real rollercoaster physics or fun. Music is distracting but thankfully you can turn it off. Coaster sound effects are poor and bubbly/distorted, they don't sound like a real rollercoaster at all. Environments are creative but the models are low quality and their placement could be more dynamic and interesting.","Jun 7, 2018 at 2:22 AM",2, 6,

2022-05-28 14:14:48.332719,thoiter,Not bad,"It's okay for the low price. The scenery is nice and the sensation of motion is fairly convincing, but in places the speed of the rails moving towards you doesn't match the speed of the world moving past  and this detracts from the immersion somewhat.  Still, it's okay as a quick introduction to motion in VR.","Mar 11, 2018 at 5:44 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 14:14:48.348676,dazun,Very nice,"Cheaper than a pint and much more satisfying. Each track had its own highlights for me; Room=sense of Speed, Picnic=sense of Height, Space=Tranquility, Moon=a really nice pic of earth. Ok, Moon was a bit weak compared to the others! :) But even if it was the only track available, it would still give better value for money than many other things that cost £2","Mar 17, 2018 at 5:50 AM",5, 3,

The rides are of about 4minutes duration and give a good approximatiopn of roller coaster rides.

2022-05-28 14:14:51.525286,Robbenz,My First VR Coaster and it was Good,"I am throughly enjoying this VR coaster app.  I LOVE riding coasters and was curious to see if VR would fill the void since I can't get away to Disney/Hershey like I used to. These rides are good and I'm impressed with them simulating the actual experience.  I'm taking it easy since still getting my VR legs and so far so good, no motion sickness; but I do just ride one at a time then go back a day later and ride another.  So far the picnic coaster is my favorite in this app.  I've only riden one other VR coaster app (the darkness coaster, or something to that affect) and both have been good, just different effects.  I'll be trying others since there are so many to choose from.","Feb 14, 2018 at 1:11 PM",4, 2,

Graphics - Sharp but simple assets

2022-05-28 14:14:54.629128,DigitalHazard,Motion Sickness,"I really thought I was simulator sickness proof in the meantime. But this here really has an impact. Not sure why.

Except that it look great. Not so much the rails in fron of you and also they are just floating, but the scenes are really fun. The 4 sound tracks are nice and so are the coasters. Most I like the start jump of the moon level and the cat in the room level =)

Graphics are really very good for VR and nicely balanced for fidelity and high frame rate, I never had the feeling the framerate drops. So real good work!","Feb 8, 2018 at 9:50 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 14:14:54.645086,Huntsman1230,"Finally, coasters done right in VR","There are a plethora of ""roller coaster"" apps out there that vary wildly in quality. Most of them are complete disappointments. Scaling can be wrong, speed is unrealistic, graphics are ugly and immersion breaking, etc. However, I can finally say that they have finally done it right this time. This feels like an ""Oculus 2.0"" app in terms of quality. It has several things going for it. For $3, you get 4 high-quality rides. The environments are gorgeous and absolutely MASSIVE. They nailed it. Stunning to look at. There are not any settings options, but I am almost 100% certain that 2.0 Supersampling is on by default (GTX 1070). Graphics are sharp and crystal clear. There are no harsh turns (attributed to many cheap VR coaster apps) and every ride is immersive. There are unexpected surprises on every track. There is a soundtrack to each coaster, although it is not synced to the movement of the track. However, it fits the theme of each ride. The tracks are quite long. This is the quality we have been longing for in a VR coaster. I was extremeley delighted multiple times and because the environments are so large, the sense of speed does not cause motion sickness (cover up the track in front of you, or look to the side, and it simply feels like you are casually flying through the environments). Not sure how large the dev team is for Coasters, but well done!","Dec 21, 2017 at 4:42 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 14:14:54.660046,FastLawyer,"4 roller coaster rides, each of them fun","So there are a lot of VR rollercoaster games out there.  This is one of the best of them, if not the best.  There are 4 rides in one game.  Each of them is fun and unique.  There is such great attention to detail  From the butterfiles, to the honey bees, to the tricycle, to the space station, to the space warp effects.  You can tell that this developer put lots of hours of love into this passion project.  This is what separates this game from most other VR roller coasters ... commitment to creating a wonderful VR world environment so you can enjoy your VR rollercoaster ride and escape reality and enter a magical virtual world full of thrills and wonder.","Jan 29, 2018 at 1:18 PM",5, 0,
