2022-05-28 19:27:01.320477,Macwhoelse,Finally. A real VR experience !!,"I have really enjoyed my experiences with the Oculus Rift the last few months. I've played lots of different games and had great fun, but none have come close to the immersion you get playing this gem. The feeling of satisfaction you get every time you solve the puzzles and move on to another sector is immense. The atmosphere is brilliant with a steady learning curve that makes you want to try the next level immediately. The graphics are everything you need in a game like this. This is the first VR game in my collection of 50 games where I forgot I was in a Virtual World and jumped into my sofa (through my guardian space) which caused great amusement to my wife who's probably still laughing hysterically now. I got this in the sale for £1.99 but trust me if I'd known it was this good I would pay £20 at least to add it to my collection. Can't wait for a second version to be released. If you haven't bought this game then add it now to your collection. This is definitely one to show off your VR experience to the relatives.","Aug 24, 2018 at 6:49 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:27:01.339426,RuneSR2,"Nice game, but it feels dated","This game may provide some insight to early VR gaming, but now it feels quite dated. Touch controls are supported including full locomotion, but controls could be much improved, and you'll need to teleport to many places. Textures are nice, but the polygon level is low. Still I got a lot of reprojections as ASW kicked in, even when using the GTX 970 settings on my heavily oc'ed GTX 1080 using super sampling 2.0 - actually Windlands 2 performs so much better, and Windlands 2's graphics are way beyond this game. This game costs next to nothing, but performance and controls aren't great, and gameplay feels dated, even slightly boring - I'm probably going to keep this game, but I can't recommend other persons to buy it.","Sep 24, 2018 at 3:25 PM",3, 1,Sorry to hear you didn't like it but there are no performance problems. Choosing to turn super sampling up to x2 will introduce performance issues because it forces rendering at a much higher resolution. This games uses dynamic lighting and shadows which other games often don't use or use much more sparingly. I feel that the dynamic lighting and shadows add to the immersion so I chose to invest in that aspect of the performance. The game was developed on and will run fine on a GTX 970 without re-projection at the default pixel density.
2022-05-28 19:27:01.358375,solstiche,Amazing ! Incredible ! Totally worth it,"I think it's one of the games that use the most of VR possibilities, and it really entertaining. It may not be an AAA game, but for the price it costs and knowing that the dev is alone (I saw that in an other comment), it's a must have ! I wouldn't be surprised if it became a cult game in a few decades (like Space invader, Pac-Man or Mario Bros)

P.S. to the developer :  it's missing a french version (it doesn't bother me, but it could help the game to have multiple languages) and as I'm french, I can help translating it if you wish (-:","May 12, 2018 at 8:48 PM",5, 3,"Thanks for leaving a review and your very generous offer to help with translation. If you send your email address to brett@headstartdesign.co.uk, I'll let you know if I get the time / funds to include a translation in the future."
2022-05-28 19:27:01.375330,crazymurdock77,Amazing game!!,"A fantastic roomscale game.  Really imersive.  Makes a change from all the ""stand in 1 place"" games we have now.  This should be in everyone's library.","Jun 9, 2018 at 12:57 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:04.532884,TAH78,Awesome VR Game,"This game is like i wished VR games would be. I bought some games but was a bit disappointed. But Dimensional is a real VR game with great graphics and good gameplay. Its like a hidden treasure in the store. I really recommend this game! There are no really bad things to say. For me personal the beginning of Level 7 is too difficult, even with mode ""simplifiy"". It's even more difficult then the final boss. Also finale stage is too difficult for me, there are too less savepoints. If you play very often the same section over and over you get frustrated. With new updates the game allows you to skip challenges, but then you miss some fun.  So some parts of the game are really too difficult - and you have to use physical power which can cause some pain in legs in sections you have to play over and over again. But this is a personal issue and not really negative. I played the whole game and i really love it. I am looking forward for a new game like this. When there will be a kickstarter project for a second game like dimensional i would try to take part of it. At the end a possible new game is announced ""Dimensional Hero"". I hope it will be developed (perhaps kickstarter project?). It seem to have weapons in it. I hope it will not be a shooter game. There are hundrets of shooters in VR and Dimensional is a too good game to be one of it. This game is a unique jewel. And the price is amazing low for this high quality game.","Apr 13, 2018 at 6:51 PM",5, 3,"Thank you for the feedback and for playing the whole game. It's good to know that some people see it through to the end :) I'm working on lots of new technical features at the moment, but I do have a project planned that will expand and improve on many of the ideas I experimented with in Dimensional. It won't be a shooter but may have weapons and tools. You can follow me on Twitter.com/jumbliVR if you would like to hear about future projects."
2022-05-28 19:27:04.548841,McNabb,"A lot of fun, until...","This game was quite enjoyable as others have said, with minor puzzles and an interesting progression. However, around level 3, I encountered a spot where I was supposed to physically jump up in the air to avoid lasers sliding along the floor. I tried maybe 20, 25 times, and the first laser got me every time. I don't know how it would track that anyway, I had no idea how to approach that as the directions specifically said ""Stand in place and jump straight up."" I gave it a good try, I'm only willing to jump so high while wearing VR goggles in the first place. So the game is over for me only three levels in, but until then it was a lot of fun, so if you can get past that it's probably fun afterwards, too.","Mar 6, 2018 at 11:50 AM",3, 4,"Hi, Thanks for the feedback. Please note that if you press the menu button you can skip to the next checkpoint in any level, so you would only miss that one task and still be able to play on . This is intended to make sure nobody gets stuck. The game experiments with a lot of different ideas and that is the only place you are required to jump."
2022-05-28 19:27:04.565796,FastForward352,,"A real hidden gem ! Congrats to the developer, everything is well polished and very clever. Buy it now, you won't regret it ! It's worth five times its price at least.","Mar 3, 2018 at 4:29 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:04.580756,andysonofbob,Blimey!  Talk about presence!,"Wow!  How is this not more popular?  Elite Dangerous, Robo Recall, Project Cars and now Dimensional: these are the games I show people trying VR for the first time.","Jun 20, 2017 at 12:42 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:27:04.596714,Bel-garath,One of the best hidden gems in the store,"This isn't about the graphics as this isn't the Witcher 3. It's about the obvious effort the Developers made to make this feel right with the Touch and the space you are in. I do have an 'optimal' play space with two front facing sensors 6ft high and 14ft apart tilted inward toward the play area. I am waiting on my 3rd sensor. Despite that, I found this game was perfectly made for 2 sensors as well. The controls are spot on and VERY easy to learn. 

I don't agree with another reviewer about the unpleasant environment or that the game doesn't give you hints. It's a puzzle game. I don't want to be led by a string and nothing is too hard to figure out so far. I also think a SyFy environment isn't meant to be Roses and Flowers. To me it fits fine. 

The best part are the moments I forgot I had a headset on and felt Presence, which I haven't had too much of until the Touch was released..if not at all. I highly recommend this game, especially at such a low price.","Dec 24, 2016 at 5:05 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 19:27:07.734322,SoakingRich,,"probably the best/most interesting mechanics of any Oculus game to date. So many great ideas packed into this, HOWEVER the art style/general vibe of the game i found unpleasant, stressful, dreary. Needs more instruction, often found myself dying constantly without any way of knowing how to avoid it. parts unintuitive, frustrating.
