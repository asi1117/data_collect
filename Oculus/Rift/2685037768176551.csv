2022-05-28 18:48:09.223002,Newbs_82,VR COD!?!,"This game is fantastic! It's like old school cod in vr. My only gripe is that it isn't on the quest 2. Developers, please put this on quest 2.","Oct 14, 2020 at 5:08 AM",4, 15,
2022-05-28 18:48:09.236964,Destroyer82,So much potential,"Like others have said this game has so much potential but no one ever seems to be online, Maybe set up a community page on Facebook to arrange games ??? keep an eye out","Sep 23, 2020 at 3:53 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:48:09.251924,Feyd999,Best VR FPS Period,"This game is honestly the best FPS i've ever played. It is so immersive. The reloading mechanic (having to grab a magazine, jam it in, and pull back the bolt) really makes you feel like you are there. 

Map design is stellar. I've been playing for months with group and we are all still discovering new vantage points. 

For the price point, its tremendous value for money. The only thing this game needs is more players (somtimes the lobby's are a bit light)

Prime time seems to be 5-7pm (EST) or 7-9pm (Taipei time) Always lots of players then. What are you waiting for?","Jul 10, 2020 at 11:53 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:48:09.266884,sgtslaughter603,FUN BUT LOBBIES ARE DEAD PLEASE PLAY,"Its a fun game. Its the only COD WWII type shooter out there now for VR. Lots of maps and weapons. I think it has a good balance between being a mil-sim like onward and a fun shooter like pavlov. Definitely has a lot of potential to fill this genre since no one else is doing it. 

Cons
-It needs polishing, especially with the UI. There is no in game menu. All you can do is see the score or leave. Cant change maps or loadout. 
-The biggest issue is no one plays. There are maybe 4 players that I see all the time, the rest are bots. I usually only have 1-2 other real people in a match. 
-Pulling the action back on the weapon fails in the positioning. I always end up accidentally pulling out a magazine trying to pull the action back or awkwardly maneuvering the rifle so my controllers have space. The sniper rifle is especially awkward to pull the bolt back. 
-Speaking of the sniper rifle, its a one hit kill no matter where you are hit. Its really annoying when the only other human in the game just sits somewhere and snipes the entire match, killing everyone with one shot 
-You have to drop your primary firearm to get to a grenade or sidearm?","Jul 7, 2020 at 2:51 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:48:12.394520,M0ne84,dead lobbies,"its fun if you want to shoot bots all day.  I played for about an hour and only ran acrosss 2 people, both of which dropped out of the game within the first 2 minutes. has a lot of potential but needs more exposure.","May 10, 2020 at 11:56 AM",3, 9,

2022-05-28 18:48:12.424439,superpozition,It’s got potential but needs work,"The UX has got a LONG ways to go. The menu system is terrible and extremely confusing. That part needs to be thought out much more with a UX expert and it needs to be done well. It creates a really poor perception of the game from the instant I open it. 

its apparent that someone on dev team is WAY too married to the idea of cocking your gun before shooting. I understand the temptation to be so literal and ‘realistic’ about every aspect of a game. But you have to make sure it’s not at the expense of the player/user.  (In that case, you should also have limited ammo and a single shot should kill me). Having to do this every time you start makes no sense and seems pointless to immersion. 

The problem with this cocking method that every game fails on is the positioning. Remember that people are holding physical touch controllers in their hand and constantly banging my own hand on the other hand actually takes me out of the immersive experience and back into real life.","Sep 6, 2019 at 9:35 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 18:48:12.439399,XKELX90,"Pretty good, just needs minor touch ups","For only $10, it's definitely a good value.  As long as the developer keeps up with it, I see it being a great WW2 VR FPS.  I'd recommend it.  Has a shooting range that allows use of every gun to practice.   Explosions could be a bit more realistic.  Lots of potential.","Aug 16, 2019 at 8:21 AM",4, 20,Thanks for your comments!
