2022-05-30 16:20:01.668052,TGRANIMAL,Fixed my marriage,My wife and been together 10 years. we have 4 kids.  We used to argue every night and stress out about everything....flash to present day...we cannot wait to get the kids to bed so we can jump on the Oculus and race!!!! Funny story my wife's first time playing we did score mode.  I told her we should probably do a different one because this one is really hard....not only she scored 30k plus points and finished on the first try. I could finish for the life of me...  This game is great for your relationship and will settle arguments... 😃,Feb 20 at 1:32 PM,5, 30,

There should be a shared library between them and allow the end user to install them at their own risk of compatibility.

This is not the games fault, the game is Awesome 5 stars. Oculus needs to stop being so darn greedy.",Nov 15 at 2:23 AM,5, 41,
2022-05-30 16:20:01.855563,Iamkilledso,Great game,This game is amazing even if your only using one controller on the oculus go. Rush makes you fell like your actually gliding around mountains and many other places! Rush is an amazing game and is definitely worth the money!,May 1 at 10:33 AM,5, 0,

2022-05-30 16:20:05.032668,Dicky300,One of the staple vr titles,Being an avid gamer sometimes I expect a lot from a game whereas VR gaming is a split between sensation and playability.

I bought a lot of apps and games on the Go store and then went out and bought a Quest 2 as soon as I could, never expecting that I'd have to pay twice for what I already bought just a few months ago.

The whol point of this game is to go fast while race wind gliding. But whenever I went just on top of a mountain it would say that I crashed and I loose. This gets in the way of the game Alot.

It manages to be fast and intense without making me sick, and the bits with the cans and Nerf guns (before and after races) are almost as good as the game.

2022-05-30 16:20:20.922525,A-GuyIn-VR,Woah.,"Ive been beginning to question the capability of VR games on the oculus go. So many games on this are poorly made and seem to be unfinished. This game though, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!

Even though it is such a simple game there is so much to do and it is so much fun. You can race other players and, even though it is a race, at the end of the match it turns onto almost a social hangout where you can blast each other with little guns or spray soda at towers of boxes. 

If you haven’t bought this game yet, you should seriously think about getting it.","Apr 22, 2020 at 6:02 AM",5, 17,

It’s so immersive and the controls are so smooth, especially if you go in settings and make it so you tilt your controller to steer. As a person who’s always had dreams of flying, this game is as close as I’ll get. Very fun way to procrastinate my homework while this virus is going on.

2022-05-30 16:20:24.046733,LarsPreston,As a newcomer: Love it!,"I'm new to VR. Started out on the Go and have come to realize that many games on the store are quite disappointing.

This game is not one of those. A little glint of light in the dark caves that is Oculus Go games.

It's easy enough to get into, the tutorial helps a bit. Simple concept, but very wonderfully executed. The lobbies with the intractable stuff help kill some time while you wait for other players to finish the race. It's an overall great experience that I recommend to everyone who is otherwise disappointed in the selection of games on the Go.","May 10, 2020 at 10:06 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-30 16:20:24.079646,david.hershwitzky,Amazing Game!!!,"This game is addicting. My headset actually overheated playing this lol.

The best way to describe is like a next level version of racing games in the arcade but wing suits instead of cars.

Beautiful levels and music. The sharp turns and close calls are exhilarating! Lots of different course layouts and different things you can do on here.

2022-05-30 16:20:24.110562,ckowal34,Disappointed,"I don't know if these other reviews were bought out or what, but this game is terribly disappointing. The multiplayer scene is dead, you will rarely find players. The single player has tons of ""levels"" that are just a 3 degree variation from the previous track. Even worse, the gameplay itself is hardly even fun ( you won't feel any butterflies playing this with such low res graphics). Absolutely the least enjoyable game I've bought on oculus with it's only redeeming(and actually good quite good) feature is the knick knacks you play around with when in a waiting room","May 7, 2020 at 10:16 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-30 16:20:27.211416,costynvd,Really fun,"It's a fun game that feels pretty realistic at times. 

It would be awesome if there was more feedback on which things make you go faster. Cutting corners? Dipping and then leveling out? It's not really clear yet. I've only played it for a few hours now. 

Although as someone who used to skydive and fly wingsuits, there are some inaccurate elements that could have been accurate with very minor research. The parachute toggles. The ring configuration on the rigs. 

Anyways all in all recommend!","Apr 19, 2020 at 3:48 PM",5, 5,

Game mechanics are a bit sparse, but who cares? The focus of the game is providing an immersive 'wingsuit experience', and it does that magnificently. I love how the entire play->finish->play again cycle is extremely short: I don't really care how many points I've scored, I want to get back up in the air again! I haven't tried multi-player mode yet, but it seems like it could be a blast.

The game delivers a fun and exciting experience as you zoom through the mountains, getting the feeling of falling. The graphics are gorgeous, especially the sunset maps, and the 3D effects really gives you a sense of depth. The mountains and hills look like they are actually miles away, while the helmet looks like it’s right there on your head. In addition, the interactive airplane which holds the menu, is really fun. I enjoy picking up the little gun and shooting darts all over. Playing basketball or opening a soda and letting it fly around is also really entertaining.

I also like the Score Trials, but think both it and the Time Trial sections would be more exciting if they also included NPCs to race/trial against, perhaps with them as ""ghosts"". 

Also, for some reason, the first eight or nine races against the NPCs in the Canyon Section were insanely easy to win; it'd be nice if the developer made those races comparable to the first two environments, in terms of having to race and figure out strategies for winning.

Request 1
You proudly offer crossplay.  but I can't play with my grandchildren (even though I have the game three times on three headsets) because my headsets are all on one Oculus account - I can't add myself as a friend.
Please, please, please let us crossplay together. The game Slightly Heroes lets us play with a Go versus a Rift by using a code. Please check that game out to see that it can be done.  My grandson, Teddie, really loves this game. It would be amazing if I could race him (and his dad) to the bottom of the mountain.

Request 2
I work with elderly and disabled people who sometimes have little or no movement in their hands. However, they can move their heads.  They can play this game by moving their head once I get them past the menus and they are standing on the mountain top. They can gaze to start and fly to the bottom of the mountain. They can't boost, but they still love the freedom of flight.
Can you please have a hands-free option and make the menus operable by hands-free gaze control too? Then they could control the game themselves. That would be very empowering for a person with limited mobility. The menus would be easy to make hands-free. I'm not sure about boost - perhaps a head flick or something or automatic boost areas. I'm sure you can work something out.
Great game. Please make it accessible for everyone.","Jun 24, 2019 at 2:58 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-30 16:21:24.165596,john.falco.16,"A rush? No, but lots of fun","Based on what I’d been reading about Rush, once the title came up for sale, it was a must-get game for me. The thought of wing suit flying down mountains and treetops was too much to resist. And once I played, the game more or less delivers what it promises. I’ll definitely be in the minority in expressing slight disappointment with it, but I wouldn’t dare discourage you from getting it. There’s a lot to like here. For one thing, the visuals are gorgeous. The scenery is about as breathtaking as can be in VR. As you stand on the platform looking around at your fellow flyers in anticipation of beginning the race, looking out at the vistas below you, the game captures that immersion well, at least for those few moments. The gameplay is smooth, with no lag or stuttering. It feels accurately timed and the controls feel precise. One can tell that a lot of care went into making the experience as glitch-free as possible. The music is really upbeat and fun, and although you can imagine lots of great songs accompanying these jumps, what is provided here is very well-suited and enjoyable. There is also a tremendous amount of replay value here. The game can be completed but you can then go back and try for a perfect three-score on each jump. There’s multiplayer and plenty of game modes, as well as collecting various wing suits, to add to the variety. 

So why was I not positively giddy about the game? There’s a few reasons why. Some are superficial, others more crucial. There’s a lot of background-rendering as you descend, which always cheapens the effect for me, but that probably helps explain why the game runs so smooth. That is at least much preferable to a perfectly-executed graphic that stutters ad nauseam. There are 4 main environments with multiple variations of the map within. Each jump is technically unique, but unfortunately not unique enough. After a while, you do start to feel like you’re doing the same thing over and over, which lessens the enjoyment. Lastly, and most importantly, I bought this game looking for what the title implies: a rush. Contrary to what others have said, I felt no sensation of actual flying. Standing certainly helps a bit, but I never once got the butterflies in my stomach that I was hoping to get. It seems like others have, and maybe you would too, but that was my honest experience.

In all, I still recommend the game, especially if you can get it on sale. I may not be as enthusiastic about it as most, but by no means is it a bad game. It’s still a blast to play. Just for me, personally, I’m still waiting for that definitive experience that provides the VR shot of adrenaline many of us seek.","May 16, 2019 at 3:24 AM",4, 11,

The only annoying thing really is when you are in Random waiting too long for the game to start when another human player joins - frustrating when they then decide to leave because they're waiting too long! Also, please include an option in Random play to rejoin other human players you're racing against if you (or they) crash! If you (or they) crash into something during a race - if they choose to retry or continue without waiting for you to finish the race (or you do if you've crashed into something) then suddenly you're not playing against them anymore and are back to racing against the AI again... which means you then have to exit and choose Random again and wait! At least give us (or other human players) an option to rejoin together at the next race or something please!

2022-05-30 16:22:18.112524,TecmoBowlTed,Many tracks or Not? Fun either way,"How you feel about this game's value depends a lot on whether you feel the 25 tracks within each of the 3 environments are 25 different tracks, or the same thing 25 ways. Big difference between 3 tracks and 75. I'm kind of in the middle. Some of them clearly take you past and through different scenery pieces like waterfalls and tunnels that you don't see in other tracks. Some of them feel fairly redundant.

Sense of motion is pretty good, game itself is pretty fun. Graphics are good but not great. Would love to see more specific pieces of scenery in the environments (ie more bridges or houses vs just open space). If we got an expansion with 2-3 more environments I'd say for sure it's worth your money, but I don't regret my purchase.

UPDATE: new update has additional track, better resolution, and some other little upgrades. Recommend you buy it!

The screen says waiting for friends to join and just spins endlessly.

Would love to see the graphics get more detail but then again you don't really notice when you're flying by everything over a hundred miles an hour. The only major request I have for the developers is a replay option so you playback your run so you can critique your lines or show your run to a friend since VR is such a private expierience.

The overall Performance is good, but the Framerate drops every few Seconds on my clean installed s7. A bit less eye candy for a smoother ride would be great. Second thing is the missing controller support. This game would rule if able to look and fly in different directions. Now its like ""focus the next ring"" over and over again, which is not that immersive as it could be. Last thing is the warp tracer effect that should induce a feeling of speed but really annoys me.

I haven't gotten to the harder tracks yet, but all the levels go down the same mountains but with different routes with checkpoints in different areas, so it does feel somewhat repetitive. You don't feel like you are going too fast which may be to prevent motion sickness and the models of your competitors seem small in scale when they are flying around you.

It is a really fleshed out experience. Well wortg the money. 3 game modes on massive 3 locations. Unlockables. Haven't tried online yet but can't wait to race friends. 

Try getting a desk fan and have it blasting in your face; that and the sound effects really immerse you.

My only gripe is the inability to mute the announcer. Unnecessary and can be annoying. Other than that, can't wait to see what else they have planned. Will definitely be coming back to this game time and time again.","Jun 3, 2017 at 8:43 AM",5, 5,
