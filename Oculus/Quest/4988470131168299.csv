2022-05-27 21:17:13.133921,AndysVrReviews,Little Cities is a cute and simple game,"Little Cities is a cute and simple city builder. You begin the game with an empty island and a balance of $20,000. As soon as you hop into the first island you are taken through a tutorial. You move around the maps by using the back trigger to drag yourself to your destination and you could also adjust your height using the thumbstick to have a god's eye view or be up close and personal. Viewing progress and city statistics could be done using your smart watch and menu items are chosen using a bubble style menu that is incredibly intuitive and satisfying to use. Options for standing and seated play are included as are settings for choosing your dominant hand. As you progress more and more content will unlock including 5 additional islands each fitting into one of three themes (either volcanic, tropical or desert). I do also know that tons of updates are coming soon such as a hand tracking update in June and an update in July that will add more assets to the game. If you are the type of person who likes city builders this is definitely a great one that could be fun for the whole family.

2022-05-27 21:17:15.175937,Game0verGame,Don’t mistake it as similar to Cites Vr,"Don’t compare this to Cites VR. Though they are both focused around building cites, they are not alike. Unlike Cites VR, Little Cites is not the type of game where you are waiting hours for stuff to build. Instead, buildings are completed fast, as in game time goes extremely fast. (About a week every 30 seconds) Little Cities is more of a sandbox game. It still has a money system, but it is very chill, and I have never run out of money. Overall, this is a great game, especially for the price, and I can not recommend it more.",A day ago,5, 54,

Some are so complex that I would play for a while and then just look for the ""earthquake"" button. Little cities is different, I play this game to enjoy and relax, no anxiety, no stress that the order of my traffic lights are wrong, just simple pleasure.

2022-05-27 21:17:29.605962,NarutoBeast,Amazing but a couple of suggestions,"I love the game, I love the different maps but I also want to watch people walking around. A little more action with the police I don't know who your target audience is but I'm 23 and I love games like these where I can build my own town but I also wanna watch it grow and see little construction workers build the buildings and people going to the airport. I wanna see more rides and more water slides and people having fun. I do like the police chases with the helicopters lol I always follow that around. Maybe we can upgrade some houses to mansions, I'm not sure if it has this more but more extreme weather and a way to prevent buildings from getting hit by the volcanos eruption lol.",13 days ago,5, 15,

Well this is it! Running smooth for Quest 1 where I still play on. Fantastic build game! Everything from UI, music and graphical presentation fits the device(s) great! Put your earphones on and jump into your little worlds. Its super happy and relaxing.,however top down in VR gives a bit of a sour neck.
Would love to campare with citiesVR,( tweaking planning difficult and lots of headage), but thats no option for this old Quester. So here my Special thanks to the developers for that!

Out of disappointment I came across this game and figured I'd give it a try. And by gosh this might be the best game I've played on Quest 2 yet.

The music is adorable, and the interface and gameplay so simple and flawless that you can just chill and build your little city without a lot of bugs, stress, or glitches.

Little Cities is probably one of my all time favorite quest games. From the graphics and gameplay it’s all amazing. My only complaint would be to add a little bit more customization or a day and night cycle. But other than that I think Purple Yonder did a fantastic job on this title.,11 days ago,5, 11,

I want a game where I can chill and not over think things.

This is it!

It’s a beautiful looking game and works really well in the VR environment. There is enough going on to keep me interested, but not so much that I need to think too far ahead or work out if I want to do this I need to do a,b,c and d first. 

Can easily kill a few hours on this (and feel relaxed at the end of a session).",11 days ago,5, 10,
2022-05-27 21:17:50.208228,sonicjessica,Which city builder did I play?,"Honestly, I just bought my oculus about a month or so ago and I struggled to find games I really wanted to play. And actually I got distracted by other hobbies have haven’t even played my oculus for a couple weeks. I also preordered Cities VR, and never even picked it up to play it honestly. 😜 ALL THAT CHANGED WITH LITTLE CITIES. I was really excited for this one because not only is it the “cute” style that I like, but it’s a management game, city builder game, but, from the looks of it, it’d be relatively easy to play and a “casual” game. I really wanted to just lose time with a game and struggled with that with the current oculus catalog. But, I just got Little Cities and I already love it. The game mechanics are so easy!!! I’ve really struggled with other VR games and how you move, grab stuff, etc. but, Little Cities has a GREAT and super short tutorial. It’s a relatively easy and simple game. This would be a great game for any of you Girlfriends out there with boyfriends that are trying to get you into VR. It’s super cute, charming, easy to play, easy to get lost in, and it’s really rewarding. Without really trying you blast through levels without ever really thinking about money. I’ve come into no issues so far with this game and I’m in love!!!!! Totally worth it!!!!!!!!! If Cities VR was to stressful for you and you like the idea of city builder game Little Cities is for you. It’s the perfect way to unwind and relax after work. I seriously cannot talk it up enough!! I love this game.",14 days ago,5, 13,
2022-05-27 21:17:52.288514,SkyArcher,Absolutely on point,"It clearly shows that Little Cities is a city builder developed with VR in mind. The gameplay is relaxing and familiar, you can play at your pace and are never overwhelmed by things to do. Visuals are smooth, colorful and clean, at times it feels like looking at wooden toys coming alive. Controls are really easy and feel natural, especially movement. Unless you are looking for a more realistic simulation and complex city management, definitely go for this- this game feels perfectly at home in VR.",11 days ago,5, 8,
2022-05-27 21:17:54.335310,Clickster38,Big Fun in Little Cities,"You can literally pick this game up and play as the developers Purple Yonder have made it so easy to play. For me the sign of a good game is when you think you have been playing for 45 minutes and it turns out it’s been 3 hours, this happened to me playing Little Cities. You actually feel like a god as you can hover high up above your city or get down and dirty among it all. The game is very colourful, I love the little touches like parrots flying across your face, dolphins and whales in the sea, hot air balloons and gliders flying about, I’ve even see a flying saucer. Obviously the aim is to grow your city, keep the peeps happy, level up unlocking new buildings in the process and then advance to the next island. There is a hand tracking update and new content on the horizon so for the price £14.99 you have to grab this delightful, relaxing, fun game now. I have a full gameplay and review video on my YouTube channel Fun with the clicks. Go check it out along with all my other VR content.",14 days ago,5, 9,
2022-05-27 21:17:56.404533,fer0n,Really nice game and a good foundation,"I love this game, it’s super relaxed and cute. The controls are very satisfying and all the little “events” going on around are very sweet.

This is a very solid foundation and I’m sure everyone has ideas as to what’s nice to have additionally. So here’s what I’m thinking:

- new buildings and cosmetics (especially stuff for single fields like trees that were on the dust island; I heard this was coming already)
- I’d like to get closer to street level to get a better idea how the city actually looks and feels like
- Audio is very flat. Maybe that’s on purpose since there aren’t any people shown and you can’t get too close to the city, but there are very few things I can identify by listening for it and it makes the city feel a bit dead
- The options are quite limited and I feel like every city will look more or less the same. Maybe planting higher sky scrapers deliberately could help? Or free form roads and more street options (roundabout, …), but I don’t know how feasible that is
- It does feel very relaxing, but it also feels quite easy overall. Maybe more transit options could help. Currently it doesn’t really seem to matter where things are, the only traffic problems are caused by construction vehicles and there gone quickly
- I’m pretty sure it’s not possible to have it run as good as it does on quest with visible people, but I’d love to have little people running around. Maybe sometime in the future when the hardware can handle it",9 days ago,5, 7,
2022-05-27 21:17:58.441728,TeaPodling,"Great game, easy to get comfortable","It took very little time to get comfortable and productive in this game.  I had a pretty rocking tutorial town in no time, and I loved every second.  The user interface is great!  I can feel that they really thought it through.

The game is simple though, so don't expect a complicated game setup like Cities: Skylines is.  The services are generally just distance within a radius rather than driving distance, so you don't have to have perfect roads to get everything covered.

It's a great middle ground if you're looking for a city builder, but don't want to deal with all the nitpicky bits.",11 days ago,5, 7,

It won't take you long to pick up on things, which is great. I haven't unlocked all the building features yet, but I am excited to see my complete functioning city.",9 days ago,5, 6,
2022-05-27 21:18:04.642483,RickJamez420,very relaxing city builder,"I love this style of game, just jump in and start playing. There isn't a wrong or right way to play, just learning how the game works. There's no stress involved. The art style of the game is great and runs very smooth on the quest 2. I like this game a lot, its a simplified version of another city builder that recently came to the platform. I like both of the games a lot. I can't wait to see what other maps/additions Little Cities makes in the coming months ! I request a night time/ day time cycle. I'll be here playing in the meantime. Great game, pick it up, easily worth 20$",13 days ago,5, 7,
2022-05-27 21:18:06.683990,ShadowScribe,Cute but pricey,Yes this game is cute and very easy/relaxing to play but it gets very old and repetitive very quickly. It is a very shallow game. Your city feels lifeless especially as you don't even see any people walking about the place (just cars). If it was a cheaper game I would probably say yeah buy it but there is just not enough content here to justify the price. There are bigger and deeper games out there for the same price as this and less. So in short a pretty cute and relaxing game that is way overpriced and has not much actually varied content.,14 days ago,3, 23,"Hello, Thank you for the review and we appreciate the feedback. Little Cities features multiple islands, with each having their own challenges, and the game is designed to be replayable so that you can take a different approach to your little city. Plus we will also be adding more content to the game with post-launch content."
2022-05-27 21:18:08.721628,ItsOnlyDoofy,"A good little game, couple of AI issues","The game itself is really well made. It’s easy to pick up and play right from the start, and challenging enough to keep you interested. The movement controls and camera controls are also very intuitive and easy to master within the first few minutes of the tutorial. The levelling up and unlocks are perfectly balanced, it doesn’t take too long to level up, but at the same time you don’t level up too quickly. 

There are a total of 6 islands to play, 1 tutorial island and 5 main islands. I would like to see more islands added in the future, as I have been able to complete the game 100% within 10 hours playing at a slow, leisurely pace. So whilst the game is short, you are never made to feel rushed, you can play the game as quickly or as slowly as you want to. I haven’t attempted it yet, but I’m guessing you would be able to speed run the game and get 100% within a couple of hours if you chose to.

I did notice a couple of things with the AI that could use improvements. The biggest one is the traffic, for example on the maps with multiple islands. In one of my islands to test this I built 5 easy access bridges between 2 islands, but 95% of the traffic chose to use just one bridge regardless of where they were heading, even if one of the other bridges would have been quicker and easier for the vehicles to go across to reach their destination. This results in long traffic jams and slow moving traffic backing up over the two islands as all the vehicles attempt to use the same bridge, ignoring the other options they have. 

Also the fire departments. If you have 2 fire departments both covering the same burning building, sometimes it’s the fire station furthest away that responds to the fire even though the closer one isn’t doing anything.

Whilst the game does have strong sandbox elements, it lacks a *true* sandbox mode. I would like to see a sandbox mode where you have unlimited funds and every region/building unlocked right from the start to really enable creativity with your islands, even if this mode has to be unlocked through gameplay. 

TL;DR bit
- quick, easy to learn controls and gameplay
- play at your own pace without feeling rushed or pressured
- levelling up is perfectly balanced
- game is enjoyable and can be relaxing to play
- traffic AI needs improvements, too many traffic jams you can’t do anything about
- lacks a true sandbox mode",3 days ago,5, 4,
2022-05-27 21:18:10.753247,Pinballer,Cute Cities!,"Adorable little city builder with a toy town-esque aesthetic. I’ve enjoyed looking at the birds and planes and other assorted creatures and man made objects that inhabit this world. It’s like playing with a toy town that’s come to life!

The  gameplay is simplistic yet enjoyable. It’s very much a streamlined city builder with very little complexity to it at all. This does impact its overall longevity somewhat but perhaps dlc will introduce new challenges to keep us interested beyond the initial release version.

 The user interface is intuitive and easy to pick up. The tutorial is easy to follow and I had no difficulty figuring out how to play.

 Music is fitting, but not quite catchy enough to have me humming along. 

The graphics are charming and a perfect fit for the quest platform. However, I’d love to see a little more variety. Customisable options especially, would be wonderful. For example: allow us to create basic custom designs and logos for our commercial stores or change the colour of our houses. Give us a choice of architecture perhaps. Spanish style villa or American style suburban ranch house etc

Lastly, please include some little people to wander around our cute little cities. Even if it’s not very many due to Quest limitations. I think it would add just that little extra charm to an already very lovely game.",14 days ago,4, 16,
2022-05-27 21:18:14.912126,mikebenda,"Cute, simple fun","I’d been waiting what seemed like ages to buy this game as I really like the genre of city and amusement park builders. 

And I bought it with an Oculus 30% discount so the price was great. 

It’s graphically simple but appealing. The control system is super easy. The gameplay is decent but not all that engaging. It’s kind of hard to keep your citizens happy as they all want industry (and jobs), cell towers and other utilities but not close to where they live. 

It would be nice to have the options to landscape or at least place parks to increase happiness. Also it would be nice to have increased happiness from citizens living on the beach. 

Also, is there a way to choose single family houses as opposed to condo/apartment buildings?

I’m looking forward to seeing what will come with future updates.",9 days ago,5, 5,
2022-05-27 21:18:16.960532,philby85,Great city builder,"This game is a winner ! It's more akin to OG Sim City than modern city builders and that's a good thing. It's not complicated to play but a heck of a lot of fun. Great but simplistic graphics. Soundscape could use more work. There are some fantastic little touches in the game from birds, to planes, ships, whales etc. Excellent job developers, awesome.

First I just want to tell you im not done with this game, im only on my second island, almost done with it. The first problem ive seen is traffic jams. Yes, there is traffic jams. Im in desperate need of building house and non of them are being built, I look to my left and there are alot of cars just standing still close to eachother, one going one way one going the other, I tried restarting it, didnt work, devs I know the game hasnt been out for too long but can you fix this?

2022-05-27 21:18:31.419974,randito3,Little Cities is fun!,"I was never into the City building games. I have tried a few in the past and got bored quick.  Little Cities is different.  It is easy to learn and fun to play.  The graphics are nice. I do wish buildings had more detail, but they do look fine how they are.  The interface is fantastic for building and managing everything.  Huge thanks to the developers for making such a wonderful and easy to use interface.  Moving around the map is easy, you can just grab and move.  You can zoom in and out of the map also.  When a house catches on fire the fire truck gets there and you see it shooting water to put out the fire.  Nice touch. I’m not going to go further in detail there are YouTube videos for that. 

There are two things I would like the developers to add if they could.  When you build a city hall, police department, fire house, school, and hospital give us the ability to name them. Have the names show on the buildings.  That would be nice.  Also, the gliders and hot air balloons design small people to be there to. It would give more life to it.

2022-05-27 21:18:35.506550,JoyMonkey8,"Addicting, but limited","What's great about it:
You're on island time constructing civilization.
You need not be concerned with money if you methodically give the city what it wants. You will generally have enough income to cover things 
Everything is cute and generally nice to look at. Hot air balloons regularly launch from your ever-sunny shores. The city celebrates your triumphs.
Infrastructure is primary about placing buildings or turbines. No sewer to design or power lines to string out.
Controls are easy, and viewing is very comfortable.
The music is nice and meditative like Walkabout Mini Golf.

What's not great:
Six island groups is all there is. No remixes or reformulations. You can delete and start an island over if you like, but there is nothing coming after the six groups to look forward to.
Unless I'm mistaken, you top out at level 25. Your island(s) are mostly filled out by now, and there's nothing indicating you should hang out and wait for the next big thing. You've reached the end of the line, and, if you're like me, you've created something pretty perfect.

This is the first game I devoted a lot of time to. I'm not usually the type to do an extended session. I bought and finished this in a single weekend. 

I would love to see this as a part of a series of related games.  This one could be Islands. Another could be Coastal or Plains, or focus on aspects like Resorts, Ports, Downtowns, or Ski Resorts.",11 days ago,4, 10,

One thing I would enjoy in the future is multiplayer, so you can play online with others or with your friends! Something else is that it would be cool to play with people on their own devices. Some games, such as Acron, have one person in vr and everyone else on their phones playing with them. This makes it fun for everyone! The one, small issue I have with this game is I find myself having to wait 3 minutes just so I can build a building, such as the medical center, because I don’t have enough money. It would be nice to be able to speed up time a little bit so you can build stuff more instead of wait around and do nothing. Other than that it’s great!",12 days ago,5, 4,

2022-05-27 21:19:00.096321,Ghostrider9876,Remember the older SimCity games?,"Playing Little Cities conjures fond memories of the SNES version of SimCity that cumulatively ate up *days* of my life back in grade school. It's a fairly simple grid based city manager where you lay out roads, designate zones, and build stuff like power plants and fire stations as needed. It's charming and peaceful, partly thanks to the music, and while the graphics are simplistic, it looks cute and runs incredibly smoothly. Little details like seagulls flying overhead or construction vehicles rolling out to build houses are a nice touch.

The controls are pretty easy to learn and very responsive, allowing you to easily move and zoom, build stuff, navigate the menus, etc. And having the vital info on a smartwatch is a stroke of genius; twist your wrist and you instantly see power, water, population, finances, citizen happiness, and what zones are in demand.

There are comfort options to help prevent nausea. They work well, and can easily be switched off if you don't need them.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:
1. As I said, it is simple. If you want a more complex city manager like Cities Skylines or the later SimCity games, you may not find this satisfying.
2. It does not currently have a sandbox mode and it would SERIOUSLY benefit from one. The devs have promised to support it with additional content, so here's hoping that's on the list. If so, that'll make it 4.5 stars.",8 days ago,4, 6,

2022-05-27 21:19:06.303224,Saxomophonist,Can't be played lying down or reclined,"If they add a table tilt feature similar to the one in DEMEO my review will be higher, but not being able to play in bed or in a reclined seat is a big downside. 

There are a few unexplained 'features' in the game, such as buildings that randomly become construction sites and need to be redesignated, or the line that extends from your offhand for no apparent reason.

Your offhand is somehow useless and essential at the same time. You need the menu and info screen access, but toggles and buttons are completely unnecessary. It could easily be made into 1handed game by adding these controls to the dominant hand. There is no movement or game interaction done with your non-dominant hand. 

Then the movement controls feel inverted in that up/down and left/right act opposite to any other game you may have played.

But in the end, it is a captivating and addictive game that is simple, straightforward and easily has over 6hrs of content.


Edit: offhand is definitely invasive, as it is required for any and all building and you must also stop what you're doing every time it levels up to watch the unlock animation. The smart watch could easily be attached to the dominant hand and make the build controls be activated by A & B, not just X & Y",13 days ago,3, 7,"Thank you for leaving a review and we appreciate the feedback.

As your little city grows your residents may chose to renovate, or leave, the city and this is why you may see construction zones or areas ready for reconstruction without any interaction.

In regards to the menu interface (i.e. the smart watch) this has been designed to be non-invasive to your city creation and allows you to continue creating your city on your dominant hand while glancing at the information on the smart watch by using your non-dominant hand."

3. Show people working, shopping going to school.

6. The doors to buildings could open.
7. When our marker hovers over a building, we should be able to know if it is a commercial, resident, business, or industrial.

It clearly shows us the features that our players want most, especially as we have committed to providing post-launch support and content updates to the game. We won't be able to deliver on every ask, but being vocal like this makes the process a lot easier!

In terms of being able to freely select the zone-specific type of building you want to place i.e. a residential high rise vs a residential small dwelling, this is actually part of the progression system for your island. Resident happiness and local prosperity feed directly into how buildings level up, which is why you'll see various sizes of residential buildings throughout your city as they grow along with you.

We're disappointed to read you didn't feel there was enough content in the game. At launch, Little Cities offers multiple islands, across a variety of different themes, that provide their own new twists on the core gameplay loop (desert with sandstorms and volcanic islands with eruptions), as well as archipelago versions of those islands. Each theme adds unique buildings as you work to grow your population and build each island to level 25.

Will there be any? Gets repetitive after a while, but still well worth it, I guess. Good job!

A few suggestions.
Make it so that buildings other than the services can be upgraded, I want to upgrade my small residential areas into skyscrapers, and shops to malls.
Add low poly people, and add a setting so you can increase and decrease the amount of vehicles, sometimes my city can feel devoid because of virtually no cars driving around.

Overall, great game, 7.5/10",12 days ago,4, 3,"Thank you for your review and feedback, it's lovely to hear about your experience and incredibly helpful to hear suggestions about what else you'd like to see from the game.

In terms of your specific suggestions:
- Residential buildings can indeed be upgraded, but this actually occurs automatically if they are placed in a prosperous area where the residents are happy. It's a great visual indicator of success in a particular area as your city grows.

- Traffic flow is an important part of the game and the more cars/traffic you see, the more you need to be looking at your road network and how it flows from the ports, making improvements as you go. If you see more traffic, then it's an indication that vehicles are struggling to get around your city so buildings will take longer to construct. If there is less traffic, you're already doing great!

We hope this helps and thank you for providing an insight into your experience."

There's no economy management and rewards and cash come quickly. There are slight challenges such as volcanoes and dust storms but if you pay attention then they're not too difficult. The UI is well done and easily understood. The music has literally gotten stuck in my head in a great way. I was smiling ear to ear watching my cities grow and listening to the wonderful music.

2022-05-27 21:19:45.467869,SharkyBear,The city builder I wanted,"If you want a relaxing, casual and simple to use city builder VR game, then this is it! The sound track and graphics really submerge you into this beautiful little world you create.

This is a very intuitive game that's easy to pick up and start creating. Moving around and placing things in your city is a breeze and is satisfying.

The background music is very relaxing and helps you stay focused on your city and the sound effects of traffic and also other things like firetrucks, schools and pedestrians help make you feel emersed in this world.

One complaint I have, is building a city in this game is pretty easy and you can level up very quickly and before you know it you have reached your peak. I know you can make adjustments and change the layout, but once you reach your peak, you want to move to the next island and start over and I have no desire to go back to my fully loaded city. I wish you can update all of your buildings instead of just the service buildings to eventually make it look like an actual city and just to keep you working forward and motivated to keep going.

Also, once you complete 1 or 2 cities, it can seem repetitive once you start over. You change how and where things are placed, but for me, I can fly through a city and know what I need to do. It would be good to have a lot more options and challenges, like different types of buildings and more design looks when it comes to landscaping.

Those are my only complaints with this. I Love this game and it's worth the price. It can really make time go by fast because you get sucked into it. It is relaxing and it's one of my new favorite VR games",10 days ago,4, 2,

Little Cities is a city creator game and going bankrupt twice is considered a game over, but to avoid this you will need to manage your city’s finances by making sure that you are earning enough money from your city. This can be achieved by making sure you have enough shops, industrial and attractions in your city alongside a decent sized population. You can even boost the amount of money earned by placing relevant buildings, such as the pier, near to shops. Do not be afraid to knock down buildings and rebuild elsewhere if they are not bringing in the revenue. 
 
You can also monitor how much money you have and see how much money you are earning each week by simply looking at your smart watch.  If you do go bankrupt then you can receive a one-off loan from the bank, but this only happens the first time you go bankrupt.  Hopefully these tips will help you avoid a bankrupting scenario in the future, and we wish you all the best in creating fantastic little cities."

This VR city builder is for the people looking to just have fun building an ever growing city. Its very easy to play, lots of options, but leaves all that tax setting and other math junk out. You just build and have fun doing it.

I have both VR city building games, and this one is by far my favorite. Easy to setup your town, expand and grow. Road laying is very important. Zones you build take up two squares of space, so place your roads wisely.

However, if you want to unwind and lose yourself in a cute, clean, and relatively simple game, this could be the perfect match. I just hope people don't give it a low score because they expected it to be some complicated city builder. Then people wonder why, after all their hard work, developers abandon games because people can't appreciate the beauty or simplicity of a game. Not all games are intended to be high-resolution, shoot-em-ups. Some games are simply designed to help you relax and find your zen, and this is one of them. The developers did an excellent job.

2022-05-27 21:20:57.390537,Evuldark,More enjoyable than cities VR,"While cities VR and little cities are entirely different games. They do obviously share a similar space of ""city builder"". And being the only two on the quest that do a traditional city build, there are obviously going to be in competition with each other. I have both and have played many of these games on PC in the past. This one is very simple, but it's presentation and feel seems to have been tailored very well for the VR environment. It's clean lines and little details makes it delightful. Flocks of birds flying around you, balloons floating past ect, while not directly important to the town building really add to the relaxing feel. The game plays out in branching stages and each level has you play out to build till you've completed it. This goal give a much needed aim, and you don't feel you're just waiting about for the next thing. Cities VR just felt like a cut down city skyline. But after playing each, little cities just feels more fun and made for VR rather than a port. I really love complex city builders on PC, e.g transport fever and city skylines. But little cities is really just a delightful fun game and is well designed for VR. Highly recommended.",5 days ago,5, 4,
2022-05-27 21:20:59.441577,Sebastain420,"Amazing, simple yet fun,","I got it this morning and played an hour before work and I can already tell im going to be playing this everymoment I get. A fun simplified city building game. The tutorial is quick and explains everything. A more relaxed city builder VS Cities VR, both are great but this one brings a cozy simplified city building experience.  That said you can't just plop down anything anywhere, it requires you to balance services power water and happiness in a more sime way yet you have to monitor your city to make sure its running. Lots of detail into the city, cars even slow down when passing cars parked on the side of the road cannot recommend enough <3",14 days ago,5, 6,
2022-05-27 21:21:01.497188,LZayas,So much Fun!,"I love Little Cities!  It is very intuitive and easy to learn.  Each little city I create gets better and better. I love the graphics and the flying helicopters, airplanes, hot air balloons, cars on the road, whales in the ocean, cruise ships, etc.  So cool to see the little fire trucks show up to put out a fire and once I was able to upgrade the fire dept they were able to use helicopters to dump water in the fire- awesome to watch. There is a challenge to keep the right balance between residential and commercial and make sure there are enough facilities and services to meet the needs of everyone. I got this the day it came out and have played it for hours already and still have lots to do- love it! I look forward to see what upgrades they come out with in the future. Great job developers! 😊",14 days ago,5, 6,
2022-05-27 21:21:03.541915,Stillhet,"Simple, Relaxing, and Addictive Fun!","I just got done with my first play session of Little Cities and I will be frequenting this game. 

Little Cities at its core is a very easy game. But this works since it’s meant to be relaxing, and it excels in that regard. It’s the type of game you wind down with and can get sucked into for hours. 

I got on and thought to myself that I’d play for around 30 minutes, but 2 hours later I was still playing! The different buildings and utilities are super fun to manage and have enough challenge in placement to keep your brain going, while not being frustratingly difficult. 

Completing my first island was a super fun experience and I aim to complete them all! 

Get this game. It’s super cheap for what it’s worth and it seems you can sink some real time into this, which I can’t say for a lot of VR single player games.",12 days ago,5, 5,

2022-05-27 21:21:09.721752,TY73R,Good launch plan for more!,"Little cities is a fun city building game that is a step down from intense city builder cities vr it is fun for all ages. My kids enjoy it and it led to my son for his art project to make a city landscape for little cities. We got through all the islands we hope in the future for more islands and unlockables. We’re very excited for the current roadmap would love to see actual citizens doing tasks or walking around to make it feel more lively.

2022-05-27 21:21:44.773256,SHIBArmy,Little Cities is BIG Fun!!,"Little Cities is the perfect pick-up-and-play city builder. Controls are simple and intuitive. The smart watch is a great tool, prompting you with what to build next. The sea gulls, hot air balloons and fireworks are all nice touches.

Other reviews have talked about the game’s calming effect? I’m neutral on this one. It neither calmed or stressed me.

As for the music, I didn’t really notice it. At least it didn’t detract from the game.

If there’s one con, it does get a little repetitive. The gameplay is essentially rinse-and-repeat from one island to the next. Players who are okay with this repetitive aspect and bulldozing / rebuilding their cities to achieve that perfect balance of properties and happy people will enjoy this game the most.

That said, I love how easy it is to build a thriving city and turn it into a little profit center. That’s where the BIG fun comes into play.

Thank for your sharing your experience of Little Cities with us and we are sorry to hear that you are having difficulty levelling up within the game.

Each island in Little Cities has a maximum level of 25, with the exception of the tutorial level which is 10, and your level increases once you have accomplished population goals on that island. During the higher levels it may feel as if your progress has stalled; but it is merely because the goal to reach the next level is higher than it was previously.

To overcome this challenge you will simply need to understand the needs of your residents and redevelop the city to accommodate. For instance attractions could be placed closer to shops so that revenue is boosted and more houses could be built to increase residents within the city. Do not be afraid to knock down buildings and rebuild elsewhere if they are not bringing in the revenue or increasing your population.

Hopefully these tips will help you reach that new level, but in the meantime we wish you all the best in Little Cities."

Little Cities features multiple islands with each having different challenges to overcome, such as the Desert Island with sandstorms and the Volcano island with volcanic eruptions, and these islands will become accessible as you progress through the game. 

The first island in Little Cities is a tutorial island that will guide you through the motions of creating your own city, while the second island is an extension of this tutorial by allowing you to create a city without any guidance. From here new islands will become accessible, with each offering a unique challenge.

We also have more content planned for Little Cities in the future, including hand tracking and cosmetic items."
