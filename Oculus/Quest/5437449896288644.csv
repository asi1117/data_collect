2022-05-27 22:15:45.793713,PGM77,Owzat for a game!,"I was sceptical, until I played it.
I haven’t played cricket for about 30 years so it was great to be able to relive some sports fun.
I saw someone had made a bat.
So I did using a broken bat.
Amazing how the developers have allowed you to adjust he controls to accept my bat.
Am relearning my batting technique.
Brill 👍",Apr 11 at 3:19 AM,5, 31,
2022-05-27 22:15:47.828584,zakaiter,"Just Amazing, feels like real","If I have to phrase the game in one line ""IB Cricket is the reason I bought Oculus Quest 2"". I have never played any PS or Xbox. 

I would love to share the story behind my plan to buy VR, I love playing badminton, Cricket, TT. Now for cricket my craze is on different level and I was missing cricket alot during COVID time.

I wanted to play cricket but at the same time i don't like pressing buttons to hit sixes. I was researching on how can I play cricket then I saw some ads by IPL players for IB Cricket. 

The video was enough to tell me about what VR is and what game is about. Next day I just ordered it from IB site for both oculus and game. Since then I have been enjoying and loving to play this game.

My favourite one is PVP mode, where you actually gets more difficulty when a human brain bowls to you and you have to score runs against them.

I must admit the developers have done a great job and the IB team thanks alot for bringing this up, this has kept the game in me alive. Even I referred to my friends in US they also bought and started playing it, so for them it was getting their childhood memories back.

I love the way developer responds to the issues reported. Let's accept there is no application in the world without bugs, but to fix those bugs when needed makes them great application and I love that enthusiasm from IB team to keep improving their features and fixing their issues.
So far it's been my best toy.
Thanks again IB team for bringing this up. :)",Apr 23 at 6:04 AM,5, 13,
2022-05-27 22:15:49.902359,BITSO,VR Cricket at its best,"I miss the old days playing backyard cricket with my dad. We lived and breathed cricket. Now he’s gone, and times have changed, backyard cricket seems to be a thing of the past…. Great memories. However, this game has reminded me of some of my most memorable experiences. Love it!!!! When we would play, we would write a scorecard with our favorite players. I would love to see this option in the game, I would love to include my dads and my name in the batting line up with Chappell, Boon, Border, Waugh, Laird etc. otherwise this is a great game for cricket lovers…. Well done!!",May 1 at 7:15 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-27 22:15:51.987327,Beaglestream,Fantastic for anyone into cricket.,"This Game is great fun. You seem to know exactly where you have hit the ball with your bat. It genuinely feels like you are in bat. I am looking forward to the ib bat being released in amazon and i will be purchasing. 

I dont know if its me or what but the bowler running in seems blurry and i feel i really strain to focus. Thats probably just my eyeballs. 

Online random 5 or 10 over quick matching would be a great addition, where the bowler has a quick selection of balls he wants to bowl to the opponent and even play as the wicket keeper while these balls are being bowled, where you can comminicate to the opponent in bat, just like in real life ( we have all had that wicket keeper that chirps in your ear )
 You can  currently play online and set balls to bowl but has to be against friends which i have none that own this game. 

Overall this game is great for any cricket fan and it will significantly improve for me once i have the ib bat. P.s i want a 5% cut for the online quickplay and wicket keeper communication idea. 🤣",Apr 25 at 6:07 AM,5, 6,
2022-05-27 22:15:54.032933,oneyellowpeacock,Best Cricket Game in VR,"I absolutely love this game and I'm addicted to it. I have almost played everyday after buying this. I used to play a lot of cricket when I was a kid. After growing up I stopped. This game takes me back to those days and I feel like a kid again(not that I'm old haha)

Local multiplayer is nice .I play with my elder brother and it's quite fun.

While the gameplay is pretty good the features are a bit janky. There's lot of different points but I'm not sure what they do except for gems which should unlock stadiums and bats but are almost impossible to collect. There are no names for players(you can edit and give them names) but it would have been better if teams had different names. very unorganised teams as well. The commentary is pathetic haha 

BUT all these cons are overshadowed by the fun you will have while playing.Hopefully with updates they improve all these things. Also if you buy this join the discord group.They keep giving updates and you can suggest or request features as well :)",Apr 26 at 11:38 PM,5, 4,

The graphics seem to be getting better with new venues, settings and avatars. Physics are generally very good although still need a bit of tweaking as does the sound of the bat when you middle it. A.

2022-05-27 22:16:00.279962,CanyonVR,Great Introduction to Cricket!,"Never played Cricket before...  Never even watched an entire match.  Being American I just knew it was something like baseball...but different.
When this popped up on the main Oculus store it got me curious.  
Well worth the price!  Absolutely LOVE it!
There seem to be so many options in this game for people that know what Cricket is...but it also does not overwhelm a brand new player and someone not familiar with Cricket.  Lots of statistics for those that like that!
I like that the developers  are still actively updating and adding to the game.  Just today they are supposed to add a patch that incorporates Bowling (pitching for Americans) into the game.
I hope in the future they will add more team management related features and more co-op.
I would tell someone that loves Cricket that this game is incentive enough to get an Oculus(Meta) Quest 2 !!!",15 days ago,5, 0,

2022-05-27 22:16:12.732519,maestrono1,Great game but AI needs to improve,"I haven't played cricket since my high-school days. This game makes me relieve those moments.

The game is quite realistic in terms of graphics and gameplay. 

The AI needs to improve a lot however. Right now, the bowler/keeper runs behind the ball for fielding but there's no one behind the stumps on either end to receive the ball for run-out.

To save one ball, 2-3 fielders run in unison. This is so stupid.

Sometimes the keeper just goes through you and starts celebrating on your face.

I think if these aspects are fixed, the game would be sooo good.",16 days ago,4, 1,
2022-05-27 22:16:14.776333,user_936499712064377,Holy s##t! This game is amazing,"The first time I tried this game, I freaked at how real the cricket felt! This VR game is actually better than the real thing. I pretty much use my oculus to just play this game. I have played other cricket and gold vr games and they don't even come close to the experience in ib cricket.

If you have never played cricket, this is a great way to get into the game!",Apr 23 at 9:05 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-27 22:16:16.848608,ketansh12,Great game but needs so many improvement,"This is the best vr cricket game out there for sure.
The bowling is super realistic, complex and challenging based on what difficulty you choose. Plenty of tournaments, bowling sets and random play available. 
Apart from that the game needs improvement in terms of how the daily matches are scheduled, the negative commentary can be super frustrating and demotivating. Recently the game has started glitching where the ball randomly drops and sticks to a point on the pitch or somewhere super close to the batsman even though you attempted a shot, the commentary even acknowledged it was a shot. 
Another thing i noticed is everyone is male in the game. My niece didn't really feel interested inthe game because of that. Sometimes the bat shield works in mysterious ways and sometimes doesnt. Sometimes the opponents even though they finished the match and have 10 wickets gone the scoreboard still shows they are playing.",18 days ago,3, 1,
2022-05-27 22:16:18.895178,JJOM_UK,Love it…,As a former club cricketer who doesn’t have the time to play these days I’m loving this. My technique now suck though… would be great to have a fielding / keeping capability!,Apr 16 at 3:15 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-27 22:16:23.078692,bizkit1961,"It's good, but no cigar","Ok I have two other cricket games which cost around half of this. Both offer the same kind of gameplay in respect of batting in a match.
Perhaps not the same for the stadiums and crowd, but that is just bells and whistles to me, doesn't change the gameplay.

That said it does have good training/coaching to it. The ability to use a bat, although I use a beat saber stick, to get a real feeling towards it and height adjustments did make this easier to get a more lifelike batting stance.

I do enjoy it and will play it more, but with slight disability towards neck and shoulder, I can at times be limited to gametime.

The game perhaps deserves 4 stars, but the price brought it down.

Also the fact that you can't play in all the stadiums, you have to open them up, I presume by doing something or the others.
I know all games do this to some extent and lots of people like that, or have the time or health to do so. But what about the people who are good enough or very casual players.
I feel like I am not getting the whole game but paid full price and get punished for my lack of skill.",Apr 20 at 8:41 AM,3, 2,
2022-05-27 22:16:25.140458,KoelJ,"Really brilliant,  great coaching tool","I thought this was just going to be an expensive  gimic and disillusionment. To my surprise the game was super immersive,  physics was spot-on and coaching tool actually helped me sort out a batting problem I had at school in the first coaching session! And   if I had that tool then ,  where could my cricket have taken me..... just get it , if you love cricket and want to experience whatvit is like in the middle again.",Apr 26 at 6:33 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-27 22:16:27.199235,BigNige62,Great game spoiled by glitches near end,In quick start I have had several frustrating glitches happen just as I approach the end of the game and nearing a record score.  The glitches start with byes not being added to the ground scoreboard but added to the on screen display when “Next Ball” appears on the display. Even worse is during play late in the game  the Next Ball screen fails to appear.  The bowling team stands around waiting for the game to continue but you CAN NOT continue as you have no option available to tell ib Cricket program to bowl the next ball.  Nothing works on the controls to get the game to continue bowling. You cannot save the game either so you LOSE your game and record score. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING!.  Other than that it is a brilliant game.,25 days ago,4, 0,

But now because of work, we hardly find time and more over need to travel and gather friends to play a game. IB cricket has open endless possibilities of how to play cricket virtually and importantly still maintaining the physics of the game. However, at times the default controller is not that precise as physical bat. But full credits to the developers on achieving something really incredible.

2022-05-27 22:16:39.681779,chaitu,Great cricket VR game,"This game is the best VR cricket game available now. Game mechanics, game play is really good. Tournaments and leagues keep the game more interesting. However like any other game this also needs improvement. Commentary should be lot better it is default for all modes. In test cricket when we play at 5 run rate Commentary says batsman should take risks and hit hard while wickets in hand. I mean come on and in odi cricket if we hit 6 runs in 3 balls commentary says decent over by the bowler. And it is better if we play against AI like now we bat AI bowls and AI also bats and we bowl to chase or set target. In future updates it's better if we can choose a country and do tours and campaign through out the year and having corresponding ICC rankings to the team. And I don't if it is possible but if game has some different faces not just default face for all and some well known player faces it will be refreshing to see.  Try to keep non striker batsman for real feel. These are my suggestions to the devs for future updates. I don't know how many are possible but these can make game more immersive and relatable to the real cricket than already It is. You guys made toughest aspect of the game made possible which is game mechanics but these add ons can take game to the next level.",May 1 at 6:31 PM,4, 0,

2022-05-27 22:16:43.773733,rabksaj,Disappointed with myself,I had high hopes and waited with anticipation and eagerness for this game. I found it amazing in every way but when I decided to up my difficulty level to medium + that's when I fell flat. I practiced and played the leagues.  I concentrated hard but I can't seem to time the ball and after a such a length of time I given up on it and now realise its not for me. When I see people play and post very high scores It makes me wonder how the hell they make over 200 in beginners league in 10 overs or 500+ in insane mode in 50 overs. Its unbelievable and unbeatable competition wether you are good at the game already or even getting better but for me it's just a spectators event.,Apr 29 at 5:07 AM,3, 1,

The developers deserve all accolades for providing variety with options like championships, quick play, campaign mode, league play, and more.

2022-05-27 22:18:21.037811,Ghoulie79,review from an actual cricketer,Being a recently retired cricketer I was blown away with how well this game captures the batting skills required and the subtle nuances of the art of batting. I almost felt like I was back playing in the heat of battle. a truly great experience and super addictive!,24 days ago,5, 1,
2022-05-27 22:18:23.071034,gumpybumpyy,Best Cricket Game So Far,"Without any doubt, this is the best & most realistic cricket game released on any gaming console.

For all newcomers & people who have not played cricket for a while, the most important thing is to be patient for the first month or so. Spend time in practicing & coaching modes. Once you get your timings right (like in real cricket), this game is going to get super addictive. I have seen many people just giving up because they cannot hit the ball. 

Also, for newcomers, do not just try power hitting. Everyone loves that but it is going to hurt your neck or back.

Compared to controller, the game is definitely better with a bat. Try to get creative with a plastic bat or something. You can tie or tape the controller.

Now that I am done with all the praises. The game can definitely need some improvements & I am sure it is going to get better with time. Some feedback includes:

1) The biggest thing is the physics. If you have played Eleven Table Tennis, you can clearly see the difference. The shots in table tennis are always accurate whereas here you can sometime get weird results with a completely different outcome than what was intended. Like, the ball hitting the back of the bat and going to third man. 

2) Fielders sometime behave really weird, like diving to pick up a ball even though its right in front. Similarly, players can go through each other.

3) If you hit a ball high enough, you get a six even if it lands inside the ground. Its like there is a height boundary. Probably, just need to increase value of a variable.

4) Figure out a way to get LBW which will make things more interesting. Probably related to #2 because ball can pass right through you.

Lastly, again, a great game which is definitely going to improve over time. Must buy for cricket lovers.",Apr 25 at 10:11 AM,5, 0,

I take small breaks during work hrs to play and It helps me do cardio throughout the day. Can't wait for the bat to be available on Amazon. Hope we can also bowl not just bat.

Attaching the controller to a plastic bat is a total game changer so this is a must if you want to enjoy the game to its fullest.

As someone who is used to batting for 10-15mins at a net, to be able to bat entire innings whenever I want is perfect.
