2022-06-13 22:56:35.658608,Beardo Benjo,Most impressive Quest 2 game in a while!,"Vox Machinae is the VR mech game that Quest 2 owners (and VR owners at large) have been waiting for, with a full single player campaign, multiplayer versus modes & a 4 player co-op mode this is the most content complete mech game I've played in VR to date and might just be the best new Quest 2 game that 2022 has delivered so far! I jumped into Vox Machinae with fairly low expectations but within the first few seconds just playing around in the main menu I could tell this project was polished to an incredibly high degree and was going to be something quite special. The controls, visuals, content on offer & overall feel of this just screams quality & has clearly been put together by a dev team who are passionate about the product they’re shipping.

The moment you strap into one of these VR mechs (there are three to choose from with customisable weapons and attachments) it feels natural to play, grabbing the levers, dials & joysticks to control your vehicle is simplistic & requires little to no tutorial or guidance. Combat is difficult & pushes the player to out manoeuvre their opponent which further adds to the intensity of the battles and the feeling of relief when they're over. In-between missions & combat scenarios you’re treated to a fully voiced story campaign with a hub world to explore & characters to interact with, it’s not ground breaking stuff but it’s an extremely welcome addition when most games in a similar category would likely just move from mission to mission. Your character also has a full body rig with legs and arms, again not ground breaking but it’s still not the norm in many VR games & I love to see it when it’s implemented.

To put it simply the game feels great to play and I'd highly recommend it as a real surprise hit for the Quest 2 platform in early 2022, a solid story and a tonne of multiplayer options that could sustain the game for years to come provided there’s a player base.

2022-06-13 22:56:35.671646,RedRum83,The Mech game I've been searching for!,"Ever since I purchased MechWarrior 2 in the middle 90s I've been searching for another more modern mech game that gave the real feeling of being in a huge heavily armed mech. Battletech in the Arcades came close, and Steel Battalion on the original Xbox came closer (once I built a cockpit around it), but not quite the thrill I was looking for, until now... This is the game I have craved for 25 long years! The Oculus Quest handles it nicely, you really feel like you are inside the physical space of your cockpit, you see your armor fly away as you are being hit, your Arms fly off with their weapons, you loose a leg and hop around on the one that remains, hell sometimes it gets taken off too and all you can do is hop around with your jump jets... Great fun!!! I had several other mech games on my Oculus, but they're gone now. Home... at... last!!! Someone, pass the ammo, I'm going in!",May 6 at 5:15 AM,5, 16, ,175
2022-06-13 22:56:35.686029,Pall_Smenis,A Tedious Teaser for mech game greatness,"First off, the good.. I've seen other reviews complaining about the graphics. Anyone who says the graphics are bad are uneducated idiots. Visually, what has been achieved here using glorified cellphone hardware is outstanding. The cockpit and mechs look awesome. 

Now the bad. 

The crew graphics, is the sh$% of nightmares... 18 teeth on the bottom row?? Tilting their heads slowly while talking to the point a bone in their neck sticks out??? Hans with massive arms that go through his body, and his tiny unproportionate  hands??? 

Enough graphics, now the game. The game play is tedious, slow and drab. Theres Way too much terrible dialogue (Frank is Dreadful) and not enough action. You finally slog through the forced dialogue to get into some ""action"" only to be faced with walking, MORE terrible dialogue then finally..... 3 mins of shooting. 

Worst of all, in between every mission your forced to run around the ship aimlessly playing ""can you find my thing"" (actual quote from the game).... you spend more time doing this than anything else. 

That's the main reason I'm writing this review. I tried to refund this dreadful game but apparently had surpassed the 2 hour playtime period whilst trying to get through all the dialogue needed to get off the ship and into a mech. Now I'm stuck with it.. 


But I did eventually get off the ship, so I can critique.. the Combat! I get mechs are suppose to be heavy, but God combat is painfully slow.... The fuel and over heating systems are sh$%, You fire 4 shots and you're over heated, you use you're jets for 10 seconds then wait 30 for them to refill... It feels like you're just taking turns shooting each other and whoever has the beefier mech wins. 

Honestly this game achieved one thing, proving VR was invented for mech pilotting games. 

So game creators... Kudos on the graphics. But may I plead the following to make this a GREAT game..  Sack your voice actors (or atleast just Frank), keep dialogue brief, don't force players to looks for cans of Jam between missions. Speed up the game play! Add actual strafe controls!  Add More fuel that lasts longer and regenerates faster way less over heating! 

Cheers",Apr 30 at 4:02 PM,2, 18,"Hi Pall_Smenis, thanks for your thoughts on the game, pity it didn't gel with your personal sensibilities. VOX is a game that takes some time to learn the nuts and bolts, though with the tools at hand these grinders can achieve some incredible fun. There is a method to the madness, and I encourage you to hop on over to multiplayer to get a real sense for exactly why it was built this way. To address one of your top issues, you are able to at any point skip any intermission to be able to jump right into the action sections. Furthermore, an upcoming update is refining the flow of the intermissions to make more sections optional, so players are never really ""forced"" through any of it, only the parts they wish to explore. Some visual illusions such as the impression of excess teeth are being addressed, though animation systems remain something in the future to improve with certain characters you noticed. With regards to fuel/heat specifically, strategic use of weapons is key, and certain weapons produce more or less heat, so changing your loadout/grinder is also important to cater to your play style. Grinders themselves come in different build sizes, and have differing fuel/heat characteristics as well. I encourage you to tinker and explore the possibilities in multiplayer, either in offline practice or online with our great community of players.",175
2022-06-13 22:56:35.699333,Spiffy,Just the mech game you wanted!,"I was in my young teens when Mechwarrior 2 came out and blew my mind.  Since then, no mech game has grabbed me the same way, until Vox Machinae.  Actually being in the cockpit, in a machine that feels massive and heavy, taking apart other mechs with a  balanced weaponry / control / damage system.. it's what I've always wanted.  it'll take a bit to learn, but rewards you when you do.

The single player campign is well done. I've read some griping about the between-mission filler, but I'll argue that it really does let the game world sink in much better with some contextual banter.. the writing is whimsical, humorous, and carries on the fine Wing Commander tradition of making the gameplay mean more when there are characters and a world associated to the things that are exploding in-game.  

 The missions themselves are nicely scripted with triggered events, story developments, pilot banter, changing objectives, just like old Mechwarrior games or Xwing missions of yore.  

Limitations of the game:  look, you can tell they're not a AAA dev with millions of $ in resources.  The human character animation looks kinda busted, the in-game scope is restrained... I wish  texture detail was more crisp, that there could be much more environmental details to sell the scale of the world, like trees, more complex building layouts, cities, little people in spacesuits taking cover... but this is on the Quest2 hardware, it's astonishing they can pull this off at all, given they have damage detail, missile trails, all the required stuff.  I want more like this, so buy it, mech (and simulation) fans!!  

Note, I'm not a multiplayer guy, but skirmishing with bots 4 on 4  is plenty of fun for many an hour.",3 days ago,5, 1, ,175
2022-06-13 22:56:35.713954,Kalbrek009,What happened?,"Seem to work well until the latest update where now somehow the transport trucks (you’re supposed to protect in Dangerous Goods) get off track & just drive in circles or drive forward, then back up & they won’t continue so as to get to Final Straw. Gave up after 15 of wandering around waiting for 1 truck (I think there are supposed to be 3 vehicles but there’s only the 1 truck) which seems to just go in circles. I’ve even tried “pushing” the truck back on track but it just continues to drive erratically in circles.",6 days ago,4, 0,"We've been able to find a very rare situation where the trucks can misbehave similar to the way you're describing. You're best bet is to restart the mission from the start, as opposed to continuing from a checkpoint, because once the problem starts it will stick around from a continue. Sorry to hear this mission is misbehaving this way. We have created a solution to the problem, though that won't be released for another few weeks with our next content update.",175
2022-06-13 22:56:42.863374,Armyguy31b01,The Mech Simulator I Waited For!,"I bought this a while ago for PC but haven't been able to play in ages.  Hearing this came to the Quest 2...my mind was blown.

PROs:  It's a mech simulator that separates itself apart from other similar titles.  Hands down, the most emersive VR experience I have (and I am somewhat of a VR enthusiast).  May just be my bias for mech games, but I absolutely love this game and is my current favorite.  The multiplayer is what really makes this game.  A total of 16 players, is pure chaos.  Unique voice chat adds to the emersion.  It feels like you are actually piloting this massive war machine.  The fan base is incredibly helpful and welcoming  to new players.  Remember, this game is treated like a sim.  Yes, you can pick up right out of the box and get into it, but there will be a learning curve.  It's. Its NOT you're typical run and gun.

CONs:. The quest version takes a hit to graphics.  No surprise there.  I am still absolutely shocked by what the team was able to squeeze in here.  The campaign is a great add, but I gotta say...not a fan of doing a bunch of meaningless tasks outside of my grinder missions.  It's frustrating trying to talk to everybody and find that ""trigger"" that gets me back into the action.  Yes there are glitches which I will outline below:

1.  Game crashes quite a bit.  Not casting which seems to be an issue as well.  At times, the game will not start at the beginning and crash out right.  Might take a few times trying to load the game initially.  I've had 4 crashes mid game so far.

2.  Graphical glitches.  Handing things to players is weird.  Body parts such as hands and legs twist and turn extremely unnatrually.  Drops the emersion value.  Picking up objects sometimes doesn't work.  

Those are the big ones right now.  Played about 5 hours total so far.  Must have!!!!",Mar 6 at 3:20 AM,5, 62, ,175

2022-06-13 22:56:57.187272,Oculus 1,Must-buy for mech lovers!,"We all read the reviews about the tedious and slow campaign but it's a good way to learn the basics of operating your grinder. Turn on teleport for movement for much faster traveling than walking. However, it's the multiplayer that shines.
It seems like the developers are considering our opinions and making the game better each time there's an update like adding places to refuel your grinder. Graphics are decent for the Oculus and the sound and voice acting are very good. Some of the weapons seem like they may not do a lot of damage like the minigun or the photon. I just wish there was a slightly better indication, by sound or sight, of how much damage the weapon I'm using is causing. Perhaps a stronger controller vibration for stronger hits, and different colors or intensities of explosions? Another thing that I would change that kind of bothers me is referring to other players that are our friends as, ""comrades."" Regarding the current state of affairs in the war in ukraine, I would rather not refer to my friends in the game as comrades.

2022-06-13 22:56:57.236564,TheJackOfNoTrades,One of my favorite games now on the go!,"This game is incredible. I picked it up last week and I instantly knew I would love it just from the main menu, this game is insanely addictive and fun with amazing physics, gameplay, multiplayer, everything!
I am going to make a couple of comparisons to the PCVR version of this game but mainly focusing on the Quest 2 version.

First off I want to say that this game had a incredible community and still has one of the better ones out there, either way you are bound to find some splendid people to spend some hours with in this game and it’s a joy to play with strangers and friends alike!

Next up in the checklist is graphics, well they are amazing on PC and pretty good on Quest 2 surprisingly! The game already had a great art style and stylish look to everything and the Quest version, while notably worse does do a decent job at portraying its unique flair, it also runs spectacularly for a mobile headset and felt just as smooth as my PC setup on my HTC Vive! 

On top of that one of my favorite aspects is the physics, I LOVE PHYSICS in games it adds a dynamic you don’t get without them and this game is heavily physics based the grinders are hulking Titans that can crush a house and you really  feel that! They walk slow and heavily and the weapons feel powerful, Even in the smaller faster mechs they still feel heavy and responsive with stellar controls for all weapons. This is one of the few Quest games I have seen use physics to such extent and as a success making it among the most impressive I have seen! Not to mention the graphics really take me back to PS2 mech worrier days and I really like it!

There are 2 notable cons to this gem of a game however, first off is that there is a fairly small player base, there never seems to be more than 20 people playing at a time which is honestly a insult to this game that people would rather be playing big standard and generic games rather than something truly unique, and 2nd con is the story. It is honestly pitiful, I was exited to see what the Devs would do with this and it is certainly… Something. Idk man the voice acting is kinda bad, characters are obnoxious, the intermission is annoying, and it always feels the need to wait for you. Like in that 2nd mission where you are following some girl who hates you or something and she says “show me your jump jet skills” and I am already up the jump it just breaks the mission, they expect people who play the campaign to be new to the game but I already had like 20hrs on PC I knew how to play this game and I was punished because of it. It leads me to just skip the campaign all together as it’s just boring and slow. I really wish they went for a more unique idea like some person that’s stranded on a planet and lives in the grinder where you need to fight other pilots to survive and collect scrap to fix broken components. Something like that would have been interesting and fun but instead we got a cheap boring story with no production value outside of the sequence where they pull the mech out of the ground at the start of a mission.

Devs if you read this please try and work on a true campaign. Don’t make it a priority but maybe in a year or two try and work on a replacement that showcases this games unique attributes.

With the content you get such as Many multiplayer modes, a full (albeit boring) campaign, good visuals for PC and Quest alike, and stellar gameplay it’s a must have on the quest and gets my recom all day everyday! 

Not to mention that the game has good social aspects, a deep sandbox you could spend 100s of hours learning, and some of the best and most balanced gameplay I have ever played makes this one of my favorite games I have ever played! 

Splendid work Space Bullet! You are putting in the work that VR needs!

Highly Recommended 6/5 stars.",22 days ago,5, 0, ,175
2022-06-13 22:56:57.250657,Gamkedo,"Love the mech gameplay, needs less fetch","5 star mech gameplay, great level of variation in the worlds and missions, mech types and weapons, enemy and friendly AI, in-game writing is all great. Genuinely nails what we imagined playing 90s PC mech games and the potential for VR interfaces.

Unfortunately, and it pains me to say this because it's clear a lot of work went into the non-mech parts, those are a 2-3 star exp in a way that prevents me from recommending this to everyone I know. Even pumping the button to skip dialog every other mission consists of walking around the ship to pick up objects, but only after talking to the right person, between tapping the watch to figure out what it's waiting to have happen next. I honestly feel like I'm completing a chore getting through it before I turn off the quest to reward myself by being able to do a mech part the next time I play. The plot is good, characters as they are in-mission is good, but if there was an option to replace the non-mech parts with a 2-3 sentence summary or brief cutscene I'd rate this 5 stars easily and it'd be my top recommendation to everyone, enough to buy a quest for. Instead, I'm hesitant to even suggest it to other quest owners without a disclaimer that it'll involve pushing through the non-mech stuff so much between getting to play the (excellent and varied) mech missions.

Minor note: I wish there was a clear indication of how long ago it saved, ambiguity of when checkpoints are leaves me often unsure how much I'll need to replay based on when I exit the game.

Updating my review: discovered today what I really wanted, simply mech combat against bots, is hidden behind the multiplayer menu (Multiplayer->Create Host->Offline Practice, the first two steps of which someone who wants bot skirmish might never click?). I'm most of the way through the single player campaign but I hadn't opened the multiplayer menu, since I don't like to play online. There's a ton of options in there and the bots are solid.",19 days ago,4, 1, ,175
2022-06-13 22:57:04.361448,Mojuggin,Terrible,"At first I was having a great time. Loved the controls. Decent graphics etc. Level design and mechanics are absolute horse crap. Combat is pretty straightforward and is kind of fun but I can't make it past the second level. The games AI(not blue) has unlimited amount of fuel. If you can't make it up a lightning pillar in one go, your partners leave you in the dust and you fail. If you do make it... they still leave you in the dust and you fail. Rage quit after an hour of attempting this. I'm going to try one more time after I watch some videos and give it one more go. But you should have to watch YouTube videos to pass a level... especially that early on in the game. If that doesn't work I'm going to ask for a refund even though I've played more than 2 hours, it was 2 hours of trying real hard not to toss the controllers across the room in rage and disbelief.",Apr 17 at 4:20 AM,1, 5,"Sorry to hear you're having trouble with the game's flying mechanic, it can definitely take some time to get the hang of it. Typically we find folks either don't pull up on the stick to gain enough vertical lift before trying to make a jump, or attempt a jump without allowing for enough fuel to fill the tank. Most missions such as #3 you describe will allow the player to pick a different grinder, and each has its maneuvering differences, so you may have luck picking a lighter one. In either case, there's lots of training tutorials built right into the game that are accessible within the multiplayer menu, and you can hone your jumpjet skills there, too.",175
2022-06-13 22:57:04.375235,Illustrious_Moongirl,Fail by Technicality,"At first I thought, ""kind of like Mass Effect,"" in the fact that the game alternates between team-building segments and harsh and violent action segments, but I found these, unlike Mass Effect, to be fraught with inconsequential choices, conversations and ""can you find the secret crystal?"" tasks.

""Hi, I'm Dorra! Can YOU find the crowbar?"" 

Boring. But the sin isn't its boredom and annoyance factor, but rather the inability to circumnavigate these gameplay portions, if desired.

Rather, it would be better to have three options: 1) play the game as intended, 2) cutscenes or something equivalent, or 3) skip these scenes and go straight into the missions.

At some point, you have to face the facts: you shouldn't force players who don't care for the story aspects of the game (or who go through times where they just want to play levels without drudging through action-less story segments which sometimes last as long as the missions) to undergo them.

Can I pay an extra five or ten dollars to have the option to skip? I'm so aggravated that I cannot at this time give this game more than a star. I'll play it since I paid for it, but it's kind of like eating crab meat -- the meat inside is good but it can be a pain in the posterior and take a while to break the shell and pull it apart to get to the meat. Sometimes, it's not worth it.",Mar 26 at 10:53 PM,1, 13,"Hi abriellecorn, it's a pity our brand of story isn't to your liking, though it's a very fair point that this, like any game, is a matter of taste. We'll save you the $5-$10 because as luck would have it, we are in the midst of working on an patch update that will allow players to do exactly what you request, limit the required interactions during intermissions, or to altogether skip them. Though we feel our intermission sequences do provide valuable and entertaining context to the campaign, we agree that some folks may just not be engaged with our brand of storytelling. Not sure about an ETA on the update, but it's coming, thanks for being patient.",175
2022-06-13 22:57:04.390415,Choddie,Frustrating single player campaign...,"Have only played the single player campaign. Initially, seemed to be a great game with good immersion and feeling of fighting in a mech. I even enjoyed the in-between interactions with the other crew members. However, some missions are frustrating hard, requiring dozens of replays to succeed, and inconsistent support from your fellow mechs. Last straw is the space mission where Frank collects the fuel, but impossible to stop him being killed, and so can't progress. Needs a difficulty setting - Hugely disappointing...",May 19 at 6:33 AM,3, 0,"You can actually just fly straight to the end of the mission once escaping to complete it that way. Defending Frank is indeed challenging, and we have heard from other players it was perhaps too challenging. A future update will be addressing some difficulty spikes such as this section and several others over the course of the campaign. Thanks for being patience, and I hope this tip helps you in getting over this section. Looking forward to your thoughts upon finishing the whole campaign!",175
2022-06-13 22:57:04.404054,dino_bot,Impulse Buy = Impulse Review,"I bought this game immediately because I thought: oh yeah! giant robot mech battles! And so, here's a similarly impulsive review. I might update this after some more time playing with it, but so far I'm happy.

PRO: oh yeah! giant mech battle!

PRO: The mech has a trucker horn that goes honk honk whenever you pull on it and I think that's awesome. 

PRO: You can control the mech realistically by manipulating the various doohickeys in the mech vehicle and/or you can map your controller to do the movements. neat!

PRO: Some of the voice acting is good.

CON: The UI for remapping the controls is cumbersome. Just give me a list of every function and then let me assign whatever I want to it. Don't break it up by which part of which controller, that's only going to slow things down.

CON: While some of the voice acting is pretty good, I can quickly tell that the voice of the mech's computer is going to get on my nerves. The sound of it is a little off to my ears, and also it's a bit repetitive telling you where to go while you're still on your way.

CON: You'll need to take some time to orient yourself to the controls. It's not un-learnable or anything but you don't get to dive right in to kicking butt like you might with a more intuitable FPS interface.

I think the story is a bit tongue-in-cheek. If you expect the cinematic narrative you might get from the Halo games for example, then you aren't really going to care much for the ""drama"" here, but if you're more inclined to take a ""oh yeah, mech battle!"" attitude like me then, well maybe you can just chuckle at the story parts and blast your way through. 

Overall, I expect this game to be fun and I don't regret the impulse buy.",Mar 5 at 2:44 PM,3, 27, ,175
2022-06-13 22:57:04.418066,Dravey82,"EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED, GET IT NOW","This game is literally everything I ever wanted in a mech game let alone a game.
I had a major beef because it's very very difficult for beginners.
maybe I didn't do the right thing or idk but jumping from lightning peak to lightning peak was like a stress level I never felt in VR yet lol.

THIS GAME IS REAL, AS IN IT IS A REAL MECH GAME.
obviously I can see all of the influences from MechWarrior to Hawken and everything in between.

I was very angry with the game because it's so difficult, but now that love hate turned into an infatuation.

It's literally one of the best games I've ever played and the story so far is freaking hilariously entertaining. It's a little long and I foresee it getting to be a little tedious (finding a bicycle horn and a starship for a robot isn't on my list to do when I'm dying to fight some mechs) but nevertheless I just discovered the multiplayer and oh my god.... you just have to try it.
All that being said, I haven't played too far into it. I'm enjoying it so much I keep playing the same things over and over as to understand them fully and get the best outcome possible.

like I previously mentioned, the multiplayer has to be one of the best multiplayers out there, very intricate very different very new to VR, you have to get this game.",Mar 7 at 7:20 PM,5, 29, ,175

Pros: 
-You’re in a mech

-The cockpit controls are fun and immersive 

Cons:

-voice acting sound stiff and awkward, and worse when the two other security guards are going at each other 

-mandatory sections where you have to go around talking to everyone. (yea the dialogue can be skipped but even then, to get to the next mission you have to talk to everyone and figure out what initiates the “go to sleep” so you can start the next mission)

-mech customisation just changes your weapons, you can’t change paint schemes, or interior, maybe you can in the multiplayer, but like I said, I’m here for the single player. 

-the devs seem to have a very specific load out in mind for each mission, for example in the first mission, I was the super tanky mech, with 4 weapons, and there was a chase that I litterally couldn’t keep up with, and only after trying a separate faster mech was I able to keep up. 

-time limited missions: I get it you want it to feel immersive, but if on mission 2 you cant keep up the mission fails, (which as mentioned before meant that you just couldn’t play one of the mech types) and on mission 4, if you don’t use these boost pads you can’t make it to the destination in time and the mission fails, which wouldn’t be an issue if: 

-the flight controls are way, way too floaty! Landing on a boost pad required you to fly on to a very small area, but these things have so much momentum, that it can be incredibly difficult to land on them, and when 1, it’s time limmited and 2, only your second real time in the mech, it makes it incredibly frustrating, and once you build up enough momentum, it’s incredibly difficult to stop without just ramming into a wall

-the fuel takes way too long to come back. If you mess up a jump, your only option, is to sit and wait for it to come back enough for you to be able to try again which is made worse by the fact that the mission is time limited!",Mar 6 at 1:25 AM,2, 17,"- Hi Full_English, thanks for giving our game a shot. You are indeed right that mech customization is primarily about weapons, though in MP you can select from all 7 grinders, each with their own unique loadouts and weapon options. On top of this, there are mods which can alter your gameplay quite significantly.

-  In terms of cosmetics, we have chosen to focus much more on player cosmetics. You can choose from 6 pilots models, and there are almost 30 headgears you can outfit to make yourself unique online. On almost all missions, you have the option to change your grinder and loadouts, though yes we decided it was best to offer at least the most sensible option as a default. 

- The ""boost pads"" you refer to on Mission3 will happen whenever you land on the pad. There is no time limit, and it will start the lightning after being ontop of it for a short time. In fact, there are really no time limits anywhere in our campaign, with the exception of 1 very special moment in the campaign. Fuel management is a very important part of the intended gameplay, mostly it's made this way for fairness in multiplayer.

Pros:  playing the first three missions give you all you need for multiplayer experience.

Multiplayer feels very true to the genre especially a walkie talkie you can grab to communicate in game.

Customizable mechs during respawn makes it an ever changing flow of battle.  You switch out mech type and weapons your opponents have to do the same to counter.  

The level of equipment for each mech is very solid and allows you to customize everything you want function wise.  I joined a room of very experienced players for my first game and was able to make myself useful by equipping a long range mech and engaging enemies with powerful shots while not being out in the open.  There are other styles of play but it was my first match of this type and it was effective.

Fundamentally gameplay has very few flaws minus user error.

Cons:  jump jets are easy to use, but hard to master.

Campaign is not really interesting enough to complete. I finished mission three and got frustrated with the episode style do some random BS talk to  All NPC be told to sleep flow.  It is not good for any game and I feel like it is alluding to low mission count to drag out game length.  My guess is this game has 15-19 missions tops with the level of episodic BS.  This is why it is a four star.  It is insulting to players.  I plan on finishing the campaign but it’s painful to try and finish in one go.


Hands stick and fling out like they are stuck to a magnet when outside of mech.

TTK is painfully a slow trying to solo a 1v 1 online, but as I said it works for this game.  I feel limbs should be easier to take out with a heavy rocket instead of 5 shots or more.  I have played with hitting joints with gauss rifle and dual gauss rifles but it does not do extra damage.  I feel this should be fixed.  Players should be rewarded for making skillful difficult shots.

It would be nice to use weapons like a flame thrower to overheat enemy mechs as well to add in a support type weapon for those who are great at head on attacks.

Would be nice to have repair drone to fix zones player feels are important that use resources like fuels and heat.

Other than that the online player base is small currently, but the quality of player both in attitude and skill is very high.

2022-06-13 22:57:33.099466,Full_English,Not good. At least not yet.,"I wasn’t playing this for a multiplayer bonanza, I was looking for some single player fun, this has potential but there are just too many things that put me off.

Pros: 
-You’re in a mech

-The cockpit controls are fun and immersive 

Cons:

-voice acting sound stiff and awkward, and worse when the two other security guards are going at each other 

-mandatory sections where you have to go around talking to everyone. (yea the dialogue can be skipped but even then, to get to the next mission you have to talk to everyone and figure out what initiates the “go to sleep” so you can start the next mission)

-mech customisation just changes your weapons, you can’t change paint schemes, or interior, maybe you can in the multiplayer, but like I said, I’m here for the single player. 

-the devs seem to have a very specific load out in mind for each mission, for example in the first mission, I was the super tanky mech, with 4 weapons, and there was a chase that I litterally couldn’t keep up with, and only after trying a separate faster mech was I able to keep up. 

-time limited missions: I get it you want it to feel immersive, but if on mission 2 you cant keep up the mission fails, (which as mentioned before meant that you just couldn’t play one of the mech types) and on mission 4, if you don’t use these boost pads you can’t make it to the destination in time and the mission fails, which wouldn’t be an issue if: 

-the flight controls are way, way too floaty! Landing on a boost pad required you to fly on to a very small area, but these things have so much momentum, that it can be incredibly difficult to land on them, and when 1, it’s time limmited and 2, only your second real time in the mech, it makes it incredibly frustrating, and once you build up enough momentum, it’s incredibly difficult to stop without just ramming into a wall

-the fuel takes way too long to come back. If you mess up a jump, your only option, is to sit and wait for it to come back enough for you to be able to try again which is made worse by the fact that the mission is time limited!",Mar 6 at 1:25 AM,2, 17,"- Hi Full_English, thanks for giving our game a shot. You are indeed right that mech customization is primarily about weapons, though in MP you can select from all 7 grinders, each with their own unique loadouts and weapon options. On top of this, there are mods which can alter your gameplay quite significantly.

-  In terms of cosmetics, we have chosen to focus much more on player cosmetics. You can choose from 6 pilots models, and there are almost 30 headgears you can outfit to make yourself unique online. On almost all missions, you have the option to change your grinder and loadouts, though yes we decided it was best to offer at least the most sensible option as a default. 

- The ""boost pads"" you refer to on Mission3 will happen whenever you land on the pad. There is no time limit, and it will start the lightning after being ontop of it for a short time. In fact, there are really no time limits anywhere in our campaign, with the exception of 1 very special moment in the campaign. Fuel management is a very important part of the intended gameplay, mostly it's made this way for fairness in multiplayer. Since we want the player to learn the ropes through the campaign, we needed to keep this the same. Thanks again for trying the game, I hope this has cleared up some things for you!",175
2022-06-13 22:57:33.113781,Godreilm,Slow campaign great multiplayer,"This game is quite fun.  It feels very immersive and authentic if you are into mech type games.  I like my games more fast pace, but the speed of gameplay while in combat feels right for what the game is.  

Pros:  playing the first three missions give you all you need for multiplayer experience.

Multiplayer feels very true to the genre especially a walkie talkie you can grab to communicate in game.

Customizable mechs during respawn makes it an ever changing flow of battle.  You switch out mech type and weapons your opponents have to do the same to counter.  

The level of equipment for each mech is very solid and allows you to customize everything you want function wise.  I joined a room of very experienced players for my first game and was able to make myself useful by equipping a long range mech and engaging enemies with powerful shots while not being out in the open.  There are other styles of play but it was my first match of this type and it was effective.

Fundamentally gameplay has very few flaws minus user error.

Cons:  jump jets are easy to use, but hard to master.

Campaign is not really interesting enough to complete. I finished mission three and got frustrated with the episode style do some random BS talk to  All NPC be told to sleep flow.  It is not good for any game and I feel like it is alluding to low mission count to drag out game length.  My guess is this game has 15-19 missions tops with the level of episodic BS.  This is why it is a four star.  It is insulting to players.  I plan on finishing the campaign but it’s painful to try and finish in one go.


Hands stick and fling out like they are stuck to a magnet when outside of mech.

TTK is painfully a slow trying to solo a 1v 1 online, but as I said it works for this game.  I feel limbs should be easier to take out with a heavy rocket instead of 5 shots or more.  I have played with hitting joints with gauss rifle and dual gauss rifles but it does not do extra damage.  I feel this should be fixed.  Players should be rewarded for making skillful difficult shots.

It would be nice to use weapons like a flame thrower to overheat enemy mechs as well to add in a support type weapon for those who are great at head on attacks.

Would be nice to have repair drone to fix zones player feels are important that use resources like fuels and heat.

Other than that the online player base is small currently, but the quality of player both in attitude and skill is very high.  

In short get the game if you like mech games and want a fun multiplayer mech game.  Don’t grab it if you want compelling campaign. It will feel like a waste of money.",Apr 19 at 7:56 AM,4, 2, ,175

Firstly the detail in the graphics is awesome. Game play is really good but the controls take some getting used to especially when using jet pack to fly around. Can’t get the hang of this at the moment. Tend to either fly too high or not at all and crash. Could do with a bit more help with the settings and controlling the machine. Having said that it’s a case of messing around until I get the hang of it.
Not tried the campaign yet but once I get used to it I will.
Definitely worth getting just for the graphics especially inside the building. Explosions could do with a bit of work on. I think the graphics used for this need a bit of work from developers.

The cockpit itself has a great 3D effect and all controls are actual sticks, levers, handles that you need to manipulate in game. 

While the graphics are clearly downgraded from the PC, they look way better than I thought they could on the Quest.

2022-06-13 22:57:47.451723,wllot,Polished and immersive Mech campaign,"I’ve only completed the single player portion of this game but I can say without a doubt that it’s one of the best and most immersive story based campaigns I’ve played in standalone VR. Not only are there likable characters that you grow to care about, there’s detail beyond the typical effort seen in indie games in the writing, lore and storytelling. The mystery unravels in an interesting way and takes you to many unique and beautiful environments (although I would have loved to see larger scale battles in a war-like setting). The soundtrack is also great, somewhat synthwave inspired mixed with traditional sci fi motifs. This is all built on top of an excellent mech cockpit sim foundation from the multiplayer which was released and has been in development for years prior to the campaign’s release. By the end of the game the characters have all had satisfying arcs and you really feel like you’re accepted as part of the crew. Going on missions with them heightens the enjoyment of the single player as you fight side by side with your comrades in a fully immersive environment, making you care about the stakes. Some people complain about the “in between” missions where you’re forced to go around the ship to talk to the characters, and I will say there are some flaws with these sections gameplay wise, but they’re there so you can get more backstory and context for the characters you will be fighting with. They help to flesh out the world and lore of the game and by the end I really thought it was brilliant to just be allowed to go around and talk to people as much as you please, hearing their stories to understand them more as individuals and see how they’ve changed. My problem with these sections was mainly more in the beginning when I was unsure of my objective, aimlessly wandering around wondering how to trigger the next story beat or be allowed to go to bed for the day to progress. I found out you had to go around to find certain specific objects scattered around the ship, highlighted by a strobing glow. Perhaps a better way to denote which objects are important or a way to check your current objective would help new players not get lost. Otherwise I loved this game for the pure immersion of being a mech pilot in a dystopian corporate owned future and highly recommend it to any Quest owner in the market for a great single player campaign.",Apr 3 at 8:09 AM,5, 3, ,175

When I heard about the the Atari Jaguar VR, and saw images of the VR hardware in gaming publications back in '95, I got really excited, having already played Virtuality games at an arcade in Ontario, CA.  Well, the Jaguar VR fizzed out, but my interest in VR didn't.  In 2009, I created my own VR headset, which was actually an HMD, with TrackIR.  The resolution of the HMD was crap, but with TrackIR, it actually worked - albeit without true 3D.  I remember playing IL-2 with my makeshift VR contraption, and being wowed that I could look all around while dog fighting.  I also remember thinking how amazing it would be to have a MechWarrior game in full VR.

Enter: Vox Machinæ.  When I heard just recently that a full VR version of a ""Mech"" game was going to be released for PC and Oculus Quest 2, I knew I had to have it.  In fact, I bought it for Oculus Quest 2 before I even owned an OC2.  The early reviews of Vox Machinæ on OC2 is what made me rush out and buy an OC2.  I really had no idea of just how good Oculus Quest 2 really is until I played Vox Machinæ.  Needless to say, I was blown away at the idea of not only being in a Virtual Reality ""Mech"", but also, virtually controlling a ""Mech, as well.  It reminded me, slightly, of Steele Battalion for the original XBOX, which, for it's time, was f***ing awesome.  The graphics in OC2 Vox Machinæ seem to have taken a hit when compared to the PC version, but that's expected, and by no means a deal-breaker.  

Vox Machinæ looks, and plays fantastically.  I'm absolutely shocked that the giants of game development companies like Bethesda haven't cashed in on this.   Giants of game dev companies' loss is Space Bullet Dynamics Corporation's GAIN.  I really could go on and on praising Vox Machinæ, but instead, I would rather implore you to play Vox Machinæ all the way through the single player campaign, and then indulge in Vox Machinæ's multiplayer component.  It's the game ALL MechWarrior fans have been waiting for.

2022-06-13 22:57:54.604058,AncientAngelCosmic,I love giant robot games!,"I actually liked this game very much! A few things were wrong with it, like an in-game menu that you can use to tweak game settings, and an open save option so that you don't loose your game progress if you do an oculus pause during a mission. I have not tried the multiplayer option yet as I am still doing campaign missions to get myself familiar with each combat rig before I show my face in a multiplayer setting, though. But so far, I am really liking this game! There should be a lot more games like this for vr! I would play them all! Anyways, great concept, developers! Keep them giant robot pilot games coming!

PS: Please make your single player ""arena-bots"" in offline team game mode able to take simple commands like, ""Defend the radar facility."" or ""Defend this area."" If I am not mistaken there once was an old combat game (Ghost Recon) that featured this nifty little set up and allowed for one person to command several NPCs to accomplish any given goal. I loved that game, too! I have already logged an awful lot of time running these rigs in this game offline and I can see that an addition like the one that I am asking for may be a bit beyond your abilities, but I just had to try. Anyways, it is a very good game as it is and I am hoping that you can continue bringing in these great robot pilot games like this one. I would love to see that big ""Decker"" rig become available for us to pilot as well. And maybe even a giant two pilot rig as well. I mean, there is no limit to the power you have in creating new robot rigs that can only enhance this game's attractiveness to new vr gamers. I am getting a lot of my friends to check your game out and I have heard nothing but great things! So, please keep advancing this concept. 

But, as a heads up, please fix the general cockpit arrangement for all cockpit versions. When I am sitting down to play this game I find that my  vr cockpit controls are set so far beneath my real world couch that I have to punch down into my seat to activate my vr control grip.  Perhaps you can tie the relative position and adjustable movement of the ejection handle in the settings menu (upward, downward, forward, or backward) to also allow for players to also be able move the relative positions of both the throttle, jump jets knob, and steering handle, as well. Just that simple adjustment could make this game even more appealing, too. 

Anyways, I think that you guys have a winner so far! Keep cranking out the hits, you guys! I love this game, and I know that I am not the only one! Thanks for making my childhood dream a reality!",Apr 29 at 8:33 AM,5, 0, ,175
2022-06-13 22:57:54.626093,PersianMagic,Where to start!!!!!,"I did not know how to start this but I’m going to with a shout out to the Devs. Listen, the depths to this game, the characters, the passion put into this to get you to understand each character, in terms of a “feeling It creates” is puts me back when I first play Mass Effect. Oh and there are many Easter eggs in here too!

Games totally worth just buying for single player. Just keep opening the game and itl work. They get that fixed. Already better from when it started. 

This is my perspective so I hope it does not turn anyone off in this way, but the single player is an amazing narrative, with amazing action missions. If you like really immersing yourself and not fixated on the the one thing you do not like, which can be easy with a genre like mechs, then you miss the appreciation. I connected with every character(but I do agree with others I was not the biggest fan of The AIs(Blue)s dictation. Wish it was more like a person like cortana(halo) style AI. 

The games amazing and yes you got to learn your mech. For example, I played the “race” section of a mission and just kept losing and got a little frustrated. But eventually I really got a grasp of that mech and by my final attempt I got the feel. That’s a sign of a good game you have to learn. 

The pull trigger for your jets are not in the best spot, wish I could adjust that, find myself grabbing the accelerator lever more times in distress. I like how u can move the screens but I would like to adjust my levers and switch’s. I will mention you can adjust the radius of point of grab. 

I’ll add more to this but one thing I can see as big for the future if the multiplayer catches hold, is adjustment of your cabin. Put the buttons and levers where you like, in a way obviously. Also this is just putting out there. Some level editor I think would be amazing for this so you can create style attack:defend levels. 

I appreciate this work. I never played it until it came to oculus platform and the port was amazing. Your storyline was amazing, shout out to the character profiles and story. I wish more people understood. Now like how I said before with Mass Effect, it was right there obviously other than different scenarios based off the dialogue but I could tell it was right there. Good job peps!",Mar 10 at 4:19 AM,5, 6,"Hi PersianMagic, thanks so much for the kind words about our game, it's much appreciated. Just wanted to mention something quick that might help you out a bit with grabbing the correct stick (throttle vs. jets). If you you rotate your palm to face downwards, you will likely grab the jets first, and if you're palm is more vertical, the grab will preference the throttle. We did it this way to encourage players to rotate their hands to match the way one would actually grab those controls. Hope that help you out with those controls!",175

The game looks nice for being on the Quest 2, but if you get motion sick easy then I'd recommend not playing this just yet, wait until you're used to VR a bit more.

The controls are better then what I expected which was using the control sticks to move around, I love how I actually have to steer the mech and keep it at an appropriate pace for whatever situation needs it. The boost can be a little wonky but it's nice to have especially with something like, ""Goldrush.""

And now I need to talk about the star of the show, the mech. They are all fun in their own respective ways, one mech is used to ram into others and the other is used to tank shots for teammates. Every mech in this game fills a different playstyle.

2022-06-13 22:58:09.015058,GameCatTodd,An Impressive Mech Pilot VR Campaign,"Ok so I was immediately blown away by the level of detail in just the opening menu..off to a good start. The level of graphical detail running on stand alone Q2 is just impressive.
Not to mention how awesome it is operating GIANT customizable mechs in VR!!
The story campaign is crafted nicely and the NPCs are all rather pleasant and not annoying or dumb, they have unique personalities and I found myself actually enjoying interacting with them in dialog. 
The gameplay is pretty fun over all but is a bit slow paced at times and I did find myself having some issues with operating the mechs. Primarily with the rocket boosters..they dont always thrust the direction you want them to go..also I found it a missed oportunity to not allow the big rig style air horn to assist in cooling off your mech durring combat. That would be a really cool mechanic to be able to pull the handle down in order to vent the cooling system quicker rather than just cease fire completely or risk shutting down.
I also wish the environments added destructible items we could crush or blow up  besides enemy mechs and the occasional gas bubble. Would add a bit more fun and interaction when navigating through these large areas without it feeling so desolate. 
Theres not a lot else that felt as if it fell a bit short to mention as it's a rather solid title so the few things I pointed out felt prominently lacking due to the level of quality implemented into everything else. 
If you are into mechwarriors or mech assault you'll love this title. Is it worth the $30 or should you wait for a sale? If mechs in VR sounds fun..yes..its worth it..if you are unsure then perhaps wait for a sale. Offering a FULL single player story campaign and a multiplayer mode Vox Machinae does so many things right in VR it's hard not to reccomend it.

2022-06-13 22:58:09.047124,FutureShock_,Best of 2022 so far...,"The Quest version breathed new life into this game and it's finally getting the attention it deserves.

Due to having so much time in the oven, the game is very polished and fully featured with excellent multiplayer and a campaign. The core mech gameplay with its immersive and interactive cockpit is the star of the show. Everything just works really well together.

The only downside is all the padding in the campaign. I'd rather they went with in-game chatter for exposition over awkward crew interactions and fetch quests. Aside from this, though, the game is excellent. 

Highly recommend for fans of this genre.",Mar 18 at 12:19 PM,5, 2, ,175
2022-06-13 22:58:09.063205,KarmaMole,"Great Meching, Tedious Ship Sections!","Vox Machinae does a lot of things good, and is a great game for Mech VR game-seekers! The multiplayer is the real standout here, and the mech controls are very nicely designed, it really does feel like you're piloting a huge mech around the landscape as you fight off enemies and go through your missions! 

The real problem with the game is that the 'narrative' sections on the ship are incredibly tedious walk and click affairs during which the animations are wooden and wonky, the scripts are long and boring, and all it really does is get in the way of you continuing the single-player campaign.

Different maps and different game modes, capture the flag, death match etc. make it interesting, also the players are very helpful and easy going on new players.

I loved it, but was a bit distracted by all the other great oculus games that didn’t need the link. It’s a dream come true that this is native on Quest now.

Pros: if you like Mech Warrior, this game is for you. It feels awesome stomping around in a giant rig. The cockpit is immersive, and most of the controls are usable (not just for looks). I just finished the tutorial part of the campaign, and it does a great job of teaching you while being fun at the same time. Easily THE mech game for the quest.

Cons: Like Mech Warrior, it can feel a little slow. That’s fine with me, as I really like the simulation aspect, but if you are expecting War Robots in VR, this is not really going to scratch that itch. Some people will gripe about the level of graphical polish. Most looks awesome, but things like the human character models, human animation that constantly clips through the geo, and  VFX (other than combat VFX), could use some polish.

All in-mission instructions are provided to the player on the right status screen, as described in the first mission. As for the intermissions, tap your watch to receive instructions from BLUE on how to proceed there (we'll also be releasing an update to allow players to skip these sections). The Quest2's capabilities are very limited, so for a game of our scope we had to reduce the fidelity of the game to fit. I encourage you to check out how the game looks on PC to get a sense of where we had to come down from.  As for the teeth, yep those didn't end up looking the greatest after being reduced, and I agree we could have done better in that particular aspect. I encourage you to look at the product as a whole, with both a campaign and 16player multiplayer that most folks are having a great time with.

You really do feel like you're in the cockpit of a lumbering mech, while you choose different mech models, loadouts and customized weapons builds. Heat management is a must, and the ejection handle under your seat is just so cool. As someone who grew up playing Mechwarrior 2, Earthseige/Starseige, Heavy Gear and so many other mech combat games, this game is soo cool. I honestly can't wait for them to keep developing this game and roll out add ons and sequels. Story is good, multiplayer is awesome, and I can't wait for them to add new mechs and weapons and other systems. I remember when Steel Batallion came out for the original X Box with all its physical controls and switches and ever since then Ive thought how cool would it be to have realistic mech combat in VR. Well now it's here. This game is awesome, and on a personal note I want to say how ""grounding"" it feels to be in this heavy, lumbering machine in VR. Oftentimes VR feels so disembodied and this has a very grounded feel that is most welcome in a VR game. More of this please and I can't wait to see how it advances with updates and sequels!

This game was crafted with the immersion of the player in mind. Piloting  a Mech in Vox surpasses the gameplay of the innumerable “copy & paste” “pick up a gun and side arm” shooters in the oculus store. The mechanics of the game are easy to catch but will take time to master if you want to dominate on the battlefield.

The single player campaign is slow and will take time to grow on me but in a way it’s the best training for the multiplayer which is the shining star of the game!😁

I would advise you to go through the training to learn which mechs and weapon load out fits you best, however if you do decide to jump right in to multiplayer there are some true vets out there that have had this game for years (Cross Play) they will make easy work of you so don’t get discouraged if you take a few “L’s” starting out.

The game is awesome! The graphics are impressive considering the hardware. The immersion one gets playing this game is top of his class. 

Single-player is really cool and let's you role-play a grinder pilot. You can, in between missions, walk around and socialize with your crew. I love it, even if the animations leave a bit to be desired

I do have one issue, though. On the second mission of the campaign, Jess keeps getting stuck and just standing near where we saw the hopper. I have tried multiple times to restart the mission but the same thing happens every time. Please fix this, it’s such a good game! And make it so you can actually eat the chefs food instead of just taking it.

UPDATE: ok this is like 2 days later, and I have already received a response from the team, which it’s great that the week I post the review I actually get a response, great job guys👍, but it says I’m supposed to look at the hopper with the scope. Apparently Jess is supposed to tell me to look at it with the scope, but she tells me that we should worry about it later and get back to the patrol, at which point the hopper flies off, and Jess gets super interested about walking into the wall.",Mar 5 at 10:20 PM,4, 2,"Hi prkrS, during this section of Mission2, Jess will instruct the player to use their scope to get a closer look at that Hopper.

I'm a huge fan of Mechwarrior games and I've even played the VR Archangel Hellfire games so I was excited to see a Mechwarrior style VR game.

Unfortunately,  right away,  this thing started to cause motion sickness issues when I turn the mech. I've played many vr games and I usually don't use snap movement but for some reason,  it feels worse in this game. They probably need a snap turning turned on by default but that could ruin the immersion. It could be the graphics too.

The graphics are, ""okay"". The npc characters are not well done at all;  They will literally put their hands through themselves while you interact with them. 

The ship or station that you go to between missions is needlessly complicated. 

The buttons don't always respond while walking around the station. Example, if I press the joystick to turn, sometimes nothing will happen.

The character interactions on the station seem useless as well. For example, I can talk to the chef, he'll give me a tray of food. If I try to sit down at the nearby tables, my tray of food disappears. So, what was the point?

Overall,  feels like this game is Early access or beta. Hopefully they clean it up. I'm hopeful because it's a Mechwarrior style VR game!

2022-06-13 22:59:27.965121,EtherSurreal,Fun! But some weak elementa,"Ok, so the prospect of a mech simulator in VR had me super excited and brought back memories of Mech Warrior and only dreaming of such. 

And the mech simulation does not disappoint. it’s childhood me’s dream and i’m loving it. 

Having said that, there are elements of the game that do bring it down, and, they are nothing to do with the mech sim itself but rather part of the game story which i’m sure under best of intentions was to help bring more context and immersion. 

But this is where it fails, horribly. 
The buddy Ai is pathetic, and has no apparent purpose than to be your voice in a non mission world that is not just stiff, it’s soul less. 

The voice acting between characters sounds forced and the need to talk to each and everyone one of them, running around the most boring of non mission spaces simply made me want to turn off after each mission. 

Where it was meant to bring an elevated level of purpose and immersion it alienated and irritated, showing up the graphical limitations. And don’t get me started on the darn drone bot in the engine room….

All in all the game, the actual simulator is lots of fun, though jump jet mechanics could have been much better thought through to add a better dimension to both mission world travel and combat manoeuvre ability. Better capability to map weapons (really b not a for a secondary weapon fire!!!) is welcome. 

Like i said it’s good fun, but there are loads of elements that make you wonder if it is value for money",Mar 14 at 2:46 AM,3, 1,"Hi EtherSurreal, Just messaging to let you know that you can full remap all the available buttons and triggers on both the quest controllers through the settings menu.

Overall the gameplay is action packed and the grinders (mechs) are unique enough to offer a solution for any playstyle.

2022-06-13 22:59:35.196586,Ryft3r,"Mechs, Mayhem, Missions and More","This is a really fun game.  I purchased it for the Quest 2 stand-alone, but I think I will be playing it in PCVR a lot more.  Something I didn't realize, is that the game supports HOTAS!  And holy crap, HOTAS is awesome.  That is not to say the touch controllers don't work amazing either.  So, you can play a more visually stripped down version untethered for a quick bit of game play, or jump into the cockpit of a massive mining machine outfitted for war and use your HOTAS (Hands On Throttle and Stick)  setup to control it.  While it is the same game, the experiences are very different, and both are very good.  

Something else I didn't realize when I purchased the game, was that it was cross-buy.  I ALMOST returned it to get the STEAM version since I learned about HOTAS.  I'm glad I didn't since there is cross-buy.  I've played a number of Mech/giant robat games through the years from the multitude of Battletech/Mechwarrior games (I even atteneded the launch event for Mechwarrior 4 in San Francisco), Starsiege, Hawken, Chromehounds, and even Steel Battalion.  Vox Machinae is a great new entry into the genre.  

I view it more of a simulation than arcade style.  I considered Hawken more arcady.  This game falls a bit more on the sim side but is not serious about it.  (So, it places fun over simulation).  

The recent release of the campaign has revitalized the game on Steam, and Space Bullet has brought the game to the Quest 2 as well, adding a much larger pool of potential players.  This game has a VERY dedicated core fan base, which is always good to see in a game.  That means it has that certain something that no other game really has.  From what I can tell, this game is also cross compatible with the Steam VR version AND you can play it flat screen as well.  Pop over to the discord where the devs are very active & old-school core fan base is amazingly helpful.

Sadly some of that content, especially interactions with your crew on the ship, is just plain bad. With unironically bad dialogue at times and simple, dumbed down fetch quests, this part of the game really brings the experience down.

The fetch quests should be made optional and the overall experience on the ship needs to be polished and/or shortened. Also, the multiplayer is a little sparse but hopefully the devs will keep supporting the game and it will continue to grow!

[Revised rating to 4 stars] - After restarting twice I was finally able to get pass this issue and was able to finish the game.  Also found that (for at least this last mission) you can skip the briefing and go directly to the launch door.

one of the practice drill on the dredge says to stomp on a mech.  after a few tries I finally land on it but it won't proceed.

I did have quite a few crashes on startup, especially when trying to run the campaign mode.  I found the new campaign mode to be pretty boring so kind of disappointed in that.  Movement in campaign as a human is really slow with smooth locomotion and there's no way to adjust it.  But looking forward to playing co-op with family on standalone quest version.",Mar 4 at 7:29 AM,4, 2, ,175
2022-06-13 23:01:37.378026,FunkJunkyD,"Elements of genius, lacking as a package","Mostly play on PCVR, immersive game with polished visuals and gameplay.  Campaign pacing is a problem, couldn't continue after the first visit to ""town"", having to walk around and talk to characters.  At this point I realized the philosophy behind the campaign is just not what I'm looking for. AI assistant is frustrating and invasive.  The radial UI is a cool concept but its terrible for things like multiplayer servers.  Mech walking speed should be faster across the board, even if it's meant to feel like you're in a hulking tank.  Part of the problem is scale; the environments have very little frame of reference to understand how huge you are, so it feels exceptionally slow unless you're using the jets. Multiplayer needs matchmaking, and shouldn't rely on host to start.  Wish the dev team would have honed in on multi once they knew Quest was getting a port since population problems could be alleviated.  Price point is reasonable considering the campaign, but I think it would have been more successful as a multiplayer only at a cheaper price, say 10-15 bucks.  I think a lot of the issues I've mentioned is why multiplayer population still isn't particularly healthy.",Mar 18 at 8:16 AM,3, 0, ,175

Story is very comical abd super cheezy, almost too much so but I only played a bit if it so far, its worth it fir multi player alone.",Mar 15 at 7:20 AM,5, 0, ,175

more on the slow side which I prefer. The Graphics are very impressive for 
a Quest game. The only thing I want is more interaction in the Cockpit of the mech
maybe More buttons to press for fire Group selection or Active abilities. or prehab’s a way
to repair broken parts? Anyway, if you like MechWarrior you will love this!",Mar 14 at 1:55 AM,5, 0, ,175

I enjoyed walking around the ship, checking out what the chef cooked up and helping the robot. Blue cracked me up several times. Of course fighting the mechs is good fun and requires some experimentation. I like the immersive quality of the game very much.",Mar 12 at 6:13 AM,5, 0, ,175
2022-06-13 23:01:44.558066,ViperVTOL,"Like being in Titanfall, But in VR","Don’t get me wrong when I say this, I absolutely love this game. It’s amazing, Beautiful, But if you have a computer and fixate on graphics, Please buy the rift version. The campaign is kind of undercooked, Rigs for the characters when you see them up close do not look alive, They feel like puppets, But atleast we have something to do if the multiplayer is down.

Oh yeah! The multiplayer! The most beautiful thing I have ever played. Fast paced, Great community unless you find a not so nice guy or girl, But other than that, It’s really fun! Buy it and thank me later, It is worth it.",Mar 11 at 6:43 AM,5, 0, ,175
2022-06-13 23:01:44.589535,jaoboo,Well worth the money.,"I mainly buy games for multiplayer, so I have yet to touch any of the single player mode yet. But that fact alone really should speak to how great this game’s multiplayer is. It’s a total blast and I’ve gotten plenty of playtime from it just in the past couple of days.

The modes are fun and dynamic, and piloting controls are really well done for touch controllers. You really get a sense of the heft of the mechs through the haptic vibrations as you stomp around. Team chat is really awesome and being able to see avatars of other players on a screen as they talk really adds a lot to the immersion.

With all that being said, I’m finding that at the moment there are only a couple full servers which is a shame. The multiplayer is truly great, but the lack of players is concerning and makes me uncertain of its longevity.

Also, crashing is a huge issue right now. I’ve crashed multiple times during play sessions.. mostly at the very start of matches, but sometimes at random. It’s really annoying, and after a couple of crashes I’ll just give up on playing anymore for the day. Devs, please iron this out!

Overall though, this game is a gem and for Quest it’s already one of my favorite titles. If you’re on the fence, pick it up. Seriously, you won’t regret it.",Mar 12 at 7:18 AM,4, 0, ,175

2. I would have loved a Multi-Player Story Mode

3. The robots move too slow.

BUT

1. I did feel like i was in the Robot. 

2. Easy to feel immersed into the world

3. Graphics were pretty good.

2022-06-13 23:01:44.643139,RivetStinger,Closest thing to Armored Core!,Just got this game today for free! Referred a friend to get an Oculus and it’s the best 30.00 store credit I’ve ever spent. On mission 3 so far. I agree being on foot can be a little boring but I don’t mind it. Gives me time to relax and enjoy the action when it does go down. I’ll jump on multiplayer after I’m done with the campaign and will definitely recommend this to everyone that I know who owns an Oculus. Great job team.,Mar 5 at 2:13 PM,5, 1, ,175
2022-06-13 23:01:51.787633,Spirit_of_69,Loved it.,"I love the controls of the mech! For a moment I completely forgot about reality! 
It's a bit annoying to move around the ship in story mode.
I probably would prefer this part to be just a text RPG instead of a whole 3d environment. But... The ship looks awesome! So why not?

With different classes of mechs, plenty of weapons, I am sure I am going to spend hours in multiplayer.",Mar 4 at 9:55 PM,5, 1, ,175
2022-06-13 23:01:51.805950,Zombaish,Favourite Quest game so far,"I've only recently got a Quest 2 but have tried several games, including In Death: Unchained, Population One, Warplanes and Mini Golf. This is my favourite so far. It really feels like you are piloting a mech, and the controls really add authenticity. Little touches like being able to move the radar screen and other cockpit elements into place physically add to the immersion.

 I haven't tried multiplayer yet, and am only a couple of missions into the campaign, but it's obvious this is easy to get into but with enough depth to make the battles challenging.

The only downside are the on-foot sections which drag a bit, but it's worth it for the missions and no doubt multiplayer.

As a game that has just been released I was expecting bugs, but it has been completely stable for me so far.

A quick note that this is described as a comfortable experience, but once you start jet boosting around during combat and tracking enemy  mechs with your head, I would say it's more towards Moderate. 

I would thoroughly recommend this game. Just go buy it!",Mar 7 at 4:48 AM,5, 1, ,175
