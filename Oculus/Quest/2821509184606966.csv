2022-05-28 11:59:59.837240,Dawn Monkey ,This game is SO WEIRD,"In a great way.  I haven't played for very long, and I haven't gotten far but the humor is fantastic. Totally laughing aloud.

You actually use your own voice, something I haven't experienced before in a VR game. It has that immediate sense of the traditional adventure/puzzle genre where you're dropped into it without handholding. 

That said, there's a tutorial to get the hang of the controls.

Can't wait to see how this shakes out!",15 days ago,5, 104,"Thank you for review! Comedy is subjective... but its good to see that some people enjoy our kind of funny!

2022-05-28 11:59:59.867346,The_VR_Grid,Like nothing else I've ever played!,"Self described as a ‘quirky VR adventure that mixes comics with radio dramas’, Area Man Lives just won’t be for everyone, but for those that are looking for a more chill & passive but still meaty narrative experience, this delivers plenty of entertainment value.  The voice recognition adds a really slick level to the immersion factor, and I think it’s use here is the best I’ve ever seen, though admittedly, that is limited to a few games.  If you are into the games like Tokyo Chronos, Hitchhiker or Project lux than I think you’ll enjoy Area Man Lives, just be aware that your first playthrough is going to be confusing, but stick with it and you’ll have a good time!

2022-05-28 11:59:59.898095,Slendershade,False advertising,"No matter what you say the characters always have the same reaction so the one aspect I was looking forward too was just a lie. I believed that the story would shape determined by what you say but it's not. The producer is too annoying, he cuts off everyone and you can barely make out what anyone says because he needs to speak every 5 seconds. There's no tutorial explaining what anything does or how the recording works for the commercials. This game is 100% not worth playing!",15 days ago,1, 39,"We're sorry you have not enjoyed the early part of the game. We hope you stick with it. Your responses to the characters do trigger different dialog in many places, but the variety of responses build the longer you play. And the actions you take in the game are what really branch the narrative as you try to direct the Area Man, sometimes to his demise. As the game moves along you'll find many more instances where both your own voice and your actions drive the story. - Amy and Ryan"
2022-05-28 11:59:59.928847,SMACJAM,Tips to navigate faster (Spoiler Alert),"This game is totally a CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE  combined with an old time radio drama, meets job simulator… and a comedy twist! Ha! Plus you get to do a little acting too. The acting of Max Greenfield, Joel McHale and Ronan Farrow is spot on which helps your imagination paint the story that is being told outside the walls of the radio station.  Plus it is just insanely fun to play off of professional actors! (I want to record myself acting with them and post it on tiktok as a duet or something and super confuse my friends) Since it is choose your own adventure it can play slow which was an annoying hurdle especially at first or if you make the wrong choices. If you want it to play faster and hear less dialogue you will need to use your detective skills and intuition to select the “correct” interactions with the items found in your office to move faster through the game. Kinda like an escape room. Except when you make a wrong choice you have to hear the dialogue all over again and it can get repetitive. I also find myself looking for clues while simultaneously listening to the producer. If I ever get really stuck I listen for the narrator (Love Her Voice!) and she will give hints. Go into this game being prepared for it to be story HEAVY …relax into it… talk out loud the whole time!! feel all your feelings… and use your imagination. (Spoiler Alert… after Area man leaves look on the map to find the next spot to guide him to… nbd if you choose the wrong one cause you just hear Schmidty be crazy) ￼I obvi haven’t finished the game yet, but it just keeps getting weirder.",15 days ago,5, 14,We can't wait to see the TIKTOK! Thank you for loving the game and for taking the time to write a review.
2022-05-28 11:59:59.957891,FeylorneDisciple,Tomb of the Scarab (youtube),"5 out of 5 stars. Game is so creative, fun, in depth, not too much. The story line is brilliant. Max Greenfield did an amazing job with his voice acting. Immediately noticed his voice as soon as the game started bringing his lines in. 

I can say I recommend for all ages! So fun!",15 days ago,5, 10,"Glad you loved the game. Thank you for taking the time to review this indie title.

2022-05-28 12:00:03.124830,MessiahSkills,"Good / Bad, Idk?","Was a very enjoyable game in the first part, story and gameplay was different that what I expected which was disappointing. I was thinking it would be more based going through different stories. Living day by day trying to make a studio thrive. But you hardly get to mess around with equipment and music. Also thought it would be more interactive to say but you take two seconds with something then your just sitting through commentary for the rest of the time. Also I get confused once you profess further in the story, I’ve been every possible route and figured it out all way to the end of the roads. But I can never find this pregnant lady! Can’t save her? Am I supposed to, don’t know how times I sat and just listened over and over. Don’t get it, bought and played for 2 days till I lost the understanding.",7 days ago,3, 5,"Thank you so much for putting as much time as you have into our game. We are planning to address a lot of the repetitiveness and fix some bugs that have been reported in our first patch. And to answer your question, yes, you are supposed to save her and it's not obvious at first, but the hints in the game will hopefully guide you there."
2022-05-28 12:00:03.155175,KarmaMole,A Flawed But Noble Adventure,"It’s hard not to admire what Area Man Lives tries to do; extensive use of voice control, a great cast, wonderful voice acting, and a story that’s equal parts Groundhog Day and 1971’s Vanishing Point! You okay a Radio DJ helping an Area Man survive to save the day. It’s great, but hampered by some technical issues and some tediously repetitive sections - all of which can be fixed with an update or two!

2022-05-28 12:00:03.215876,AstronautFarm,"Mic previously wasnt working, now it is.","I enjoy the game after having trouble getting my mic working. It seemed to be a system issue as I tried everything to fix it before finally doing a complete system reset which meant losing all my previously downloaded games. Tried the game out after reinstalling again and was able to run it with the voice detection working. 

I game is what I expected and I am happy to figure out a fix to play it. Check it out if you like narrative games with some interactive elements.",6 days ago,5, 2,"I'm so glad your mic is working now, but I'm sorry it took a factory reset to get it there. Thank you for reaching out and working with us!"
2022-05-28 12:00:03.246794,ParadiseDecay,I got a little confused!,"Impressions Video with Commentary:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWdw24m4kuQ

My Initial Impressions:
I like the concept and idea, but I got really confused as what to do?
It slowly started to dawn on me after watching my own footage 3 times.
Also, some of the interactions felt a little off, I would press a button only for it to turn off again if I did not move my hand away very quickly, and vice versa.
The game has lots of narrative but the humor I did not really find that funny. But, that might just be me.",10 days ago,3, 2,Thank you so much for your review! We are planning to address issues as they are reported. Hopefully you'll jump back in and help the Area Man save the day!
2022-05-28 12:00:06.406579,Sav3_St4te,The Most Surreal Meta Quest experience,"I haven't finished the game per se, but I just spent 2 hours playing in a session. If you can play this game blind, do it. Explore everything you can. There's some errors with the sync and text of the captions, as well as the computer being on and displaying multiple images through my entire run through that keep me from giving this game a full 5 stars, but if you don't mind some immersion breaking bugs, this game is some of the best $20 you'll spend on this headset",12 days ago,4, 2,Thank you for playing the game and writing this great review. We will look into some of sync issues you mentioned with the hope to have a patch available in a few weeks.

I have no idea how to make myself a reasonable height",13 days ago,3, 1,"Thanks for the feedback! We will add a way to adjust the floor position in the next update. For now, we recommend playing sitting down if possible."
