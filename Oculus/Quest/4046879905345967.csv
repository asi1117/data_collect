2022-05-27 21:24:14.493092,AndysVrReviews,Great city builder!,"While I have never played a city building game before I naively went into Cities VR thinking I was going to be able to build a thriving metropolis within 30 minutes or less. After about five minutes in the game I was able to see it for what the game really is, a city building sim. Now maybe that is a slight exaggeration but the level of detail and thought that has to go into your city was more than I had expected. You not only have to be sure your residents have utilities but you also have to keep in mind how you build them and how what you do affects the residents. For example, if you put a windmill next to housing, the residents will complain about the sound. This game might not be for everyone but if you are someone that enjoys building something from nothing and seeing your creation come to life then this game is for you.

2022-05-27 21:24:16.534674,EshaddackE,I will play this for many hours,"I was part of the playtest a while ago. I have never played Skylines before but always been intrigued by it, so was a little terrified to get this game at first but man it really does a good job of teaching me the ins and outs of the mechanics. It is so cool to start planning out your city and to see how it grows, and I also think they did a great job with the controller and the menus here. The game also looks way better inside the headset than I thought it would after watching the trailers and pictures. Seeing the lights in your city turn on as night falls with boats passing on the water is really awesome.

Now I have only played a couple of hours on the fairview map so have probably just scratched the surface, but so far its been a blast to play. I love building roads and painting the zones, that feels very VR to me. Also watching my citizens as they go to work etc. I am however not super good at keeping my own economy in check in real life so will likely struggle a little with balancing the books here!

Although the game is not perfect (I had some small issues with the bulldoze button for example) the devs have said that they will keep supporting it for a long time. This is definitely a game I will spend hours and hours in and I really think VR needs more of this type of game that is not over in a heartbeat!",Apr 29 at 2:01 AM,5, 124,"Thanks for the awesome in-depth review! It really means the world to us. We will continue to support the game with free content updates, feature additions and general improvements!

2022-05-27 21:24:18.572197,The_VR_Grid,A Solid City Builder Hampered By Tech,"Once I figured out how to make my city flourish, the game loop quickly devolved into me waiting for cash to upgrade and waiting some more and I know this genre isn’t exactly known for fast-paced action, but this feel particularly monotonous.  Even as I grew my city, I couldn’t help but notice just how limited my real-estate was and while that’s not game breaking, I just questioned why I wasn’t playing the PC version which looks way better, has a few more building options, mods and allows for a truly substantial city and not just a demo-sized one.  Cities VR, I think gets the job done when it comes to gameplay, but just barely, making for an experience that will disappoint city builder veterans and frustrate new users to the genre.

2022-05-27 21:24:20.614531,dracomike,Excellent but..,"This game is awesome so far. But no speed control just pause and unpause. It makes it hard to give it 5 stars. Also I thought I would be able to walk around the city as if I was a little citizen. You can get close to street level but you are never really like a person size and you never get the feeling you are walking around your city. Other than those minor critiques the game is awesome

Edit: so I take it back there is a speed control but it's clunky. You have to swivel your arm left to bring up the menu. Then if you hold the left joystick all the way to the left and wait it changes... But it's not intuitive and doesn't seem to work consistently. The speed control needs to be improved somehow it's essential to city builders so it doesn't become boring",Apr 29 at 8:09 AM,4, 110,"Hi, great to hear you like the game. Regarding the speed control, you should only need to hold the left stick down and it will send a vibration as it goes through the different speeds. Tapping it will play/pause.

2022-05-27 21:24:22.649020,Devedander,It's Cities Lite - with a splash of VR,"The spirit of Cities Skylines is definitely here with most of the familiar options and gameplay.   If you want a fun city builder in VR it's definitely there, but if you are a hardcore Skylines PC or console player, there's probably not a lot here to get value from.  

Unlike Super Hot FTG did not transform their game by making it VR.  In fact they missed quite a few opportunities to take advantage of the format.  For example roomscale movement is oddly scaled and you can't zoom in down to street view (basically you can get down to roof view) taking a lot of potential fun away from seeing the city as if you were a person in it.  

Overall it feels kind of like the Switch where ""Yup it's Skylines"" but other than being mobile it's nothing new.  Here you access it in VR, but it's nothing really new and it's scaled back in a lot of ways.

The graphics have been severely scaled down, and while they do their job well don't expect to be wowed by the presentation.    Pop in and low quality textures abound but never stop you from understanding what's going on. 

The controls are functional but could use some refinement.  There's a bit too much digging through layers of menus and the control wheel are way too small.  That said you quickly learn what does what and it isn't much of an issue after the first half hour or so. 

This game is best played seated both to save yourself from having to look down too harshly and  I feel like they scaled movement when zoomed out so 2 steps is 2 game world steps where when zoomed out it should be a mile. 

The sound is great, the Skylines soundtrack is there in all it's glory and the city sounds are familiar. 

Overall I think this game has a lot of value for those who are new to city builders are casual Skylines players.  But hardcore experienced players may find there's not much new here and a lot missing especially with the 1 tile limit.

That said give the 2 hour return window a try - you will know quickly if you love it or hate it.",Apr 30 at 1:51 AM,4, 37,"Thanks for taking the time to write such a thorough review!

2022-05-27 21:24:26.822178,xSebo,Brilliant VR edition,"After sinking countless hours into Cities skylines on my PC, I was ecstatic upon hearing that it was to be coming to quest.

I downloaded and played it non stop for 5 hours on release, and it's amazing! The feeling of playing god and managing your own metropolis from this perspective is incredibly immersive!

The only qualm I have is the lack of features compared to skylines, but that is to be expected for something that has to run on a quest, and furthermore, free updates have been promised which is something I love to see!

One of the smallest additions I'd love to have that skylines has is the ability to raise and lower roads, but again this game is still brilliant, and I would highly recommend it!
EDIT: Looks like that's already in the game!",Apr 29 at 9:08 PM,5, 18,"Thanks for leaving a review, we're happy to hear you like it! Regarding the roads, you can indeed raise and lower them! When you have a road selected, simply hold down the right grip trigger and raise/lower your hand/arm. Please give that a try!"
2022-05-27 21:24:28.866335,Nikeetz,Not for me,"Controls weren’t that intuitive. They felt janky and yikes - the graphics are horrible imo. What frame rate is being used? It feels jittery and really dull looking. Maybe I didn’t get far enough but I expected more from a studio like FTG. I’m refunding and I’m going to wait for little cities and hope that’s better.

Also why not 3 view modes - getting down closer to street level is important. And don’t tell me it’s impossible. Deisim allows free movement within the world.",Apr 29 at 3:34 AM,1, 30,"Thanks for your review, sad to hear it was not for you! The frame rate is at a stable 72fps and regarding getting closer to the street level, this is indeed something you can do in the game! You can visit and watch your cities come alive from really close up:-)

Street level view can for example be seen in this video: https://youtu.be/7779PRJs2ZY?t=138"
2022-05-27 21:24:30.897025,SharpAttorney77,Cities Skylines at it's most basic.,"I have spent about 2 hours in the game so far, it has crashed once in that time. It is cities skylines at it's most basic, there's no upkeep costs for roads and the maps are very small (only 1 tile). But due to this everything is scaled to fit within the 1 tile. It's very easy to make money and is, ad the developers say, a very good introduction to the series. Graphics wise; you can tell it was made for the quest however it does have people walking around and makes the whole city feel a whole lot more realistic. A few things I wish they would add are: Autosave feature and options to have a more realistic experience (pollution from industry and upkeep costs for roads).",Apr 29 at 5:54 AM,5, 16,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review, we are so happy to hear you enjoy the game!

I spent between 2.5-3 hours in this today and I feel I’ve got at least 50% of the way through. The controls take some practice and I did the tutorial twice to make sure I understood but after that I was simply loving it. That time flew by. There’s quite bit to mange but you can manipulate time to help you.

2022-05-27 21:24:41.198023,Dionysus Mex,The thrill of creating a city,"I became a fan of Simcity 4 around twenty years ago, was mesmerised by it and spent countless hours creating cities. I haven't played Cities skylines, but I'm an enthusiast of VR and was eagerly waiting for this game to come out. It's an awesome city builder! Just be aware that the learning curve is long. At some point I even got quite frustrated, I couldn't correctly place power lines and didn't understand what I was doing wrong. And yeah, as other reviews have already pointed out, gaphics are not great and many other details need to be improved (relatively small maps not connected with each other, limited variety of building options, awkward controls at times, repetitive animations of citizens, excessive darkness at night). But hey, it's the first game of its type in virtual reality, and it can only get better (the devs seem really active working on improvements). The exhilarating sensation of hovering above my newly created city and seeing it come to life was a deeply satisfying experience. Perhaps it's not a game for everyone, you need patience and love for ""building"". As for me, I'm sure that from now on, after learning the ropes, it will be pure enjoyment for many, many hours.

2022-05-27 21:24:43.273537,YellowLab,Awesome Detailed City Builder,"Well done city simulation game.  I was uncertain about Cities VR or Little Cities,  so I bought both. 
I am veteran sim gamer who has been building cities since Ceaser and Zeus.   (Super old timey pc gamers know what I'm talking about.) 
Little Cities just didnt do it for me and I returned it.   Too simple and lack of any challenge.  I actually like games that I lose at,  bc it forces me to get better. 

Cities VR may not be as highly visually appealing as LC,  but the complexity beats LC hands down.  Also,  while not AS hard core challenging as most pc city sim AAA games,  this does a very good job in VR.  Enough to keep me occupied in one session for more then the time of a full battery drain.

What it does need is an Auto-Save.  How hard can that be to put in? 

Not sure why some people complain that this game is too stressful or hard.  Yes,  a bit of a learning curve and if you like details in management this is for you.
They can go back to playing Gorilla  Tag with the kiddies and forget about a game that requires you to think.",6 days ago,5, 4,
2022-05-27 21:24:45.324004,Myron-BE,Finally a city builder in VR,"I always wanted to play a city builder in VR and this one definitely deliver.
Of course it is not as rich as a pc version visually and I wish I could interact more with my own hands but seeing dawn light up your city for the first time is a magical moment that make you forget the small details.

Small remark though : I am left handed and being able to point with the left controller would be a big plus for me. I give the 5 star in advance as I am sure you will improve that in the coming weeks :)",Apr 29 at 5:55 AM,5, 11,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review, we're so happy you like the game!

2022-05-27 21:24:47.369097,Henrich,The best game ever,"I love this game, I love the graphics and the realism. The controls are great, but maybe add some more structures in education, healthcare, police, and firefighters. And maybe you can expand the maps more and add more maps but you don’t have to do all that since this is just the beginning of the game.

2022-05-27 21:24:51.535144,Tyrien121,Cities Vr,"Absolute fan of Cities Skyline, I own it both on Xbox and Pc, and I built hundreds of different cities, unfortunately this doesn’t feel the same, the graphics is what makes the game immersive, even if it a little downgraded on console, it still looks stunning. You don’t get that with cities vr, very very bland, I understand the limitation of the quest 2, so I not upset with the developer, they did the best with what they had. I still think this game has an audience, but for people who don’t normally play city builders, I feel this will leave a bad name to it. The lighting/shading are very dull, building resolution are very low (ps2) and after a few hours, none of it is really appealing to the eye. 

Saying all this, the fact you can build a city where ever you want, in real life not in game, is pretty cool. The game runs smoothly and offers a new way to play, I’m very excited to see where this leads

If your a fan, definitely worth it, but for people not sure, I would wait until more content is added. Or a special offer.",Apr 29 at 1:18 PM,3, 14,"Thanks you for taking the time to leave a review, we appreciate it! And more free content, features and improvements will be added following the launch!"
2022-05-27 21:24:53.566891,ponuryprezes,Failure (but not epic failure),"Where are tunnels and bridges over/under roads? You can only make road at ground level or over water, that's a failure!

There are so many things cut out of Cities: Skylines, it lost any depth of the original. Only 4 parks, only roads (no railways etc), no special buildings. City is very small, smaller than one area in C:S, feels like 10k residents max.

Graphics are bad, objects constantly pop in and out, colors are washed out, night is too dark.

Movement is also bad. Head tracking doesn't work, movement and smooth turning is slow even in highest setting, and inability to move outside city area is a mistake.

This game should not be bought and should not have been published in this state.",Apr 29 at 3:54 PM,2, 14,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review, we are sad to hear you did not appreciate the game. Adapting Skylines to a standalone headset like the Quest 2 is no easy task and while some compromises like the amount of tiles you can build on etc. have had to be made, we are still proud in getting this much content into the game. For your information, we will continue to support the game with free content updates, feature additions and improvements.

2022-05-27 21:24:55.605238,Snoozieee,"Great game so far, one gripe.","Actually liking the game so far, the graphics aren’t as bad as people have been saying (at least personally) everything looks good, the only problem is some pop in of trees and buildings. But that can be fixed with updates. Game has good amount of depth to be enjoyable and not feel like a demo version of the game for VR. My one problem is, cities skylines is a game I would have up while listening to a YouTube video, or watching a show. Sitting and staring at your city does get a little boring, especially when you’re just waiting for money to build more things. I know a YouTube browser in game would be a stretch, but even an in game music player or something would be nice. Just something to keep you occupied in the downtime of the game.",Apr 30 at 12:22 AM,4, 12,
2022-05-27 21:24:57.643709,FoxLynx64,A port that is worse than the original,"If you’ve played any VR ports before (like the Bethesda games) then this is way worse.  It uses the same broken code from the original game which is why the graphics had to be lowered to something that wouldn’t be acceptable 10 years ago in a city builder.  I could get over that, if it wasn’t for the fact many of the more specific buildings you had in City Skylines are just gone in the port.  You won’t be able to make monorails, you have a limited selection when it comes to parks, bus stops are hard to manage, and to top it all off most of the building are blocked by population size which becomes difficult when you need a college to get higher educated workers for the demand your businesses have.  In real life, there are no bars for how big your city is.  Instead any city can build whatever they want provided they have money, but this game flat out ignores that.  It feels somewhere in between SimCity Buildit and City Skylines.  If this was $5-10 then I wouldn’t mind all that much, but this is $30 which is more than I spent on the original game.  This is Quest exclusive, so PC modding is out of the question which is what Bethesda basically depended on for their ports.  Once you buy this there is no making it better and you have 14 days for a refund.  I will say it’s redeeming factor is the approach to UI that I actually found very intuitive.  This is basically the first AAA city builder for VR and while it may have a lot of flaws, the core concept is really good and kept a lot of the road building you can find in the original.  I would have loved for some terraforming abilities so I could make crazy stuff with the roads like you do in the original.  I think with some updates the game could do a lot better and I do enjoy playing the game, just not as much as the original.  I can really see the potential with city builders in VR if they nail it better, but this is just sad.",Apr 30 at 3:02 PM,1, 12,"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We will keep improving the game with free content updates, feature additions and general fixes. That said, our intention with Cities: VR was never to make a straight port of Skylines with all it's content - that would probably be a poor experience in VR and also quite impossible on a standalone headset.

Less than an hour in I’ve pretty much learned all I need to know in order to enjoy the game. If you’re expecting to jump in already knowing how to play, this probably isn’t the game for you.

2022-05-27 21:25:03.856160,ToniAvEx,Already love it,"So, I am a long time player of City Skylines on PC so I already knew the concept of how to start my city.  It took a little bit to get to know the way the controls work but actually they are designed extremely well and intuitively.  I feel really at home with it within a very short time.  I did cheat and use the unlimited money and all achievements unlocked so that I could get used to the building without constraints.

Already excited for new add ons like trains and specific buildings.  Would be great if, ultimately, there was a chance to have first person views whils riding transport, but accepts that may be a way, away.

2022-05-27 21:25:07.939753,Tazzoman,Great chill game!,"I've been playing city builders since the first DOS version of Simcity in the 90s. This exceeded my expectation for what you can do in VR now. Yes it does take time to get used to the controls and how things work, but that goes with the genre. To do all the complex things you need in a city builder and put it into VR game with very few buttons takes talent and they pulled it off.

Don't listen to the negativity about this game. They are working on a $300 headset from 2 years ago, what they put together is a great game with the graphics leveled needed to make it work. This isn't a pancake game on a $500 console and its not a $3000 PC VR title. So yes it has LOD models that get a little blocky when you zoom out. Shadows are not super smooth. But I thought it looked great. Seeing cars zip around, people leave the cars a head into their houses, building upgrading, catching fire, so much detail on a cheap mobile processor! 

Also it has a ton of menus to check/change budgets, happiness, zoning, everything you would expect in a pancake city builder.

2022-05-27 21:25:09.979795,Bumblebees3 ,Not intuitive,"I was so excited about this game, so far its been a big letdown.  I've spent about 40 min so far and can't get through the tutorial.  It has step by step instructions but instructions on each page flips by so fast I don't have time to read the page and figure out controls.  I'm trying to find some online walkthoughs but so far no luck.  All the videos I find have cities that are in progress, and I need walkthoughs with a new build.  Now I'm hesitant to play as I may need more than 2 hours to figure out if this game is for me.

Update: I played for another 35 min. Also can't figure out how to save progress.   This time I was starting to feel nauseous.  I will need to request a refund.",Apr 30 at 6:26 AM,1, 10,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. The tutorial is getting improved in the first patch which should be too far away.

2022-05-27 21:25:16.201773,M1sterC,Should be 5 stars but ..,"Having played this on PC and console versions I set my expectations low, but what has been achieved is great. Controls were a bit fiddly at first but (especially controlling game speed) but now seem quite natural. You can really relax and just watch the world go by whilst you plan and build your city. 

There are things that could be improved, 

There does need to be an option to autosave. I lost a good hours effort by simply trying to turn the music off and when backing out of menus I foolishly hit back to main menu.

There needs to be a battery indicator - if I wasn’t annoyed enough losing my last save, I lost mother hour as my headset simply shutdown due to low battery with no warning .. again all my work lost .. 

Option to turn off the Moon/Sun cycle … and the actually movement of the moon in the sky is quite clunky!, not smooth. Okay, not many people spend their time looking up in the sky but don’t have airplanes flying over to make me do that

Closer zoom - it seems you can get really close (ie: on the side of a bridge allows you to get really close and low down) but there is a forced height level which means you are always viewing from about 10 metres above everything. I’d like to zoom closer. Maybe it’s to stop your view from sitting inside buildings but it would be great to get to ground Level.

Would like to follow people/cars - or even become that person (likewise be in a vehicle ) so you can really get the feel of walking around your city.

Laying a one way road seems harder than it should. You have no way of knowing which way it’s facing before you lay it. Can you add an overlay which shows which way the traffic will be going?

No music variety. Can’t be much of a space waster, but seems like just one track has been ported over.

Given the size constraints of the map it seems to me some of the road overlays (roundabout / junction) would take up 2-3% of the entire map space and I’ve yet to work out if it was logistically possible to have a highway running through my City. If the size constraint is always going to be an issue then maybe focus on the smaller roads, cycle lanes, footpaths might be a better route to take?

Ideas for the future 

When you tilt your left controller to the right you get detail on money, population etc .. maybe tilting controller left could bring up data on buildings, cars or people or simple stats on power, water, waste.

As the controls for moving remind me a little of google earth .. maybe sticking the left controller to your head could do something magical? - like bring up a whole info page of your city .. or show the city where crime is high, traffic etc… 

All in all, great game. I think it’s a great port and look forward to the future updates",23 days ago,4, 7,"Hey M1sterC. Thanks so much for the review & the in-depth feedback.

However, I have some suggestions:
1. The tutorial only covers the basic operation of the game, it can be difficult to get started for players who haven't played the desktop version of City Skylines, It would be better if more detailed tutorials were added.
2. A wiki can be added to the game, containing some tips for the game (eg: pumps should be built upstream of rivers, factories should be away from residential areas)
3. The game can add more modes, And the initial amount of money at the start of the game can be customized.",Apr 29 at 10:14 PM,5, 6,"Many thanks for taking the time to post this review, we're so happy to hear you like it!

2022-05-27 21:25:28.582807,Ralkion,Fun city builder with some hiccups,"Let me start off by saying I absolutely have been loving this game. It has many shortcomings but the only other game in recent memory to hook me like this was elden ring this year. Despite technical issues and even losing a full hour of gameplay from the game not saving properly, it's still quite fun.

Graphics are nothing to write home about, this is a standalone quest game where you build a city with thousands of people and manage tons of facets of it. If you're expecting this any to look anything like the PC version, you need to remember what is capable on the hardware. Pop in, blurry textures, choppiness when trying to place large structures like a roundabout, it's all here.

There are some weird bugs like you can see around the peripherals of your vision the game drawing in the world around you every time you look and turn around. It's bit distracting and immersion breaking. I also had saved the game this morning only to find out it didn't save and all of my progress was gone. So I had to start back at least an hour. There is no auto save which means you have to manually save and after what happened today I'm going to be saving twice just to be sure. This is an absolutely horrible omission and better be in a software update.

The game play loop is very satisfying for me, I used to play these kind of games back in the 90s and 2000s and fell out of love of them ever since since I've been primarily a console gamer. I've played cities on PC a few times and I never once got sucked in like I did for this VR version. I can't speak to how deep it is, I'm pretty sure I've unlocked everything in the game a few times now on a few different maps so I do worry about replayability over time. But what is here is a lot of fun for me.

If you can look past the graphics I'd really suggest giving this game a try. I'm really hoping they make a PC version with cross save so I can play a really nice PC version and then take my city with me on the go",23 days ago,3, 6,"Thank you for the in-depth review.

Update: went on discord to find out how to save the game. It's doesn't tell in the tutorial. Overall the game is fun and addicting!!! 4 stars only cuz the graphics can be a little better.

I was willing to forgive that it looks janky (don’t kid yourself, it does, lol) and they the space to build is limited, but I spent 10 minutes just trying to understand how to connect actual power to buildings in the tutorial and got stuck there.  I  skipped the tutorial (being familiar from owning the PC version) and decided to push through, but was already turned off by the tutorial experience.  The wheel control is not intuitive, it feels clunky and after some being unable to reach street level, I just quit.  Maybe this gets updated or they release a PC-VR version, but until then, this gets refunded.  Too many polished games in my library for me to be struggling through this one.

Great concepts and graphics. It took me a good 1 hour to learn the mechanics of both controllers especially the interplay between both R and L controllers.
This game is definitely far from easy and the true challenge is in balancing city building and economics. Expect to spend hours and mild addiction is possible. Patience is the best strategy. Would recommend this game if you have the time to spend and watch out for mild vertigo in the later part of the game when repetitive 360 degree views may be required to view your city and solve problems .

2022-05-27 21:25:42.950073,Pythia_Of_Delphi,This game is going to be great,"I live in a large city, so laying out a neighborhood street grid was pretty easy.  Knowing where to put the businesses and industrial areas was also pretty easy. The tutorial let me know that I should put the windmills away from the residents, so I placed them on the hills, and I put the coal power plant a couple miles from town. But I ran into trouble when the tutorial was not very helpful in how to run the power lines. 

I would like to suggest some updates: 

The roads tool (aim and build), needs a two-button operation. activate to start building. Deactivate to stop building, so you can reposition your viewpoint.

In order to switch from constructing roads, bulldozing them, or designating land as residential,  you have to keep hitting the ""B"" button to back out until you get to the tools menu. There should be a shortcut to get to the tools menu. And by giving us a shortcut to the tools menu, we also get a shortcut the the bulldozer. If there is already a shortcut, I never found it.

There should be a shortcut to the tutorial, in case you forgot how to do something.

Ive read a lot of the reviews here and most of it is people probably not understanding/ havnt figured it out. I think maybe there could be better way to help people like maybe moving screen that actual shows the process. 
Other than that I love being able to deal with all the elements of city building. Money will not be a problem once you get further in and then you just redevelop(while making some unhappy residents :) ). 

It is pretty simple once you figure it out, as long as your building is next to power it gets power so power lines really should never be an issue. It really has a lot of stuff to do. We always can have more upgrades and variety 😝, but there is plenty to be happy with. 

Just hit about 23-24,000p woot woot keep it growing. Nothing beats seeing your highway system actually start working and fixing your traffic clogs. 🙌 

I did have one question. I had 2 universities worked fine. The 3rd one I built cause one of the 3 to always be at 0. They pretty spread out and have their own bus lines and everything. Tried moving them a little or new routes but couldn’t get it to not hit 0 at one of them.

2022-05-27 21:25:49.092340,simona5691,Not so simple!!!,"I was excited to get a City building game in VR, because I played a lot of city building games on PC and my Smartphone for years. And I got even more than expected. I failed at the first turtorial with electrity. After I got it I failed with my second city. I made long streets, large living areas, large working areas. For lack of people my factories were closed, but the people never moved in large living areas. And my money run out.  My third city develops well.  My budget is OK most of the time. The trick was to make small areas for living, then small other areas. Small living areas again. With almost no free places to work some more working areas. People moved in inmediately, went to the work immediately. Some living areas, then some factories and small shops again. If you don´t like to wait for income, you can choose indefinitely budget. A bit of cheating, but the game runs more smooth, after reaching milestones you will be able to build necessary buildings, such as police station immediately. But I would not recommend to open all milestones, an university or a big hospital is unnecessary for a small village.
I was able to walk on the streets of the cities, built by me. I watched the people returning in the houses after workday. I even watched a young man walking his dog over the bridge. A lot of small details. Still, I never figured out, why some small businesses were never built on the place I intended, but big factories are developing immediately. I got so excited, I forgot to save my game and probably missed the warning, my battery was empty, my Oculus went black. Now I am charging battery and I am curious, will my game be autosaved, or I have to beginn again before first milestone.",Apr 30 at 9:20 PM,5, 4,"Thank you for the 5 star review!

2022-05-27 21:25:55.320893,Manurocker95,No idea what game are others playing tbh,"This is a really sincere review after spending 400+ hours in Skylines between PC, Steam Deck (gaming mode + mouse and controller) and Nintendo Switch; and being hyped for Cities VR for so long.

First, the game doesn't look at all like the first trailers the authors showed to the public. The graphics are reduced with a HUGE downgrade that makes this game to wonder why there are so many framedrops to 40-50fps. Because yes, the game is not smooth at all even with pop-in at 10 meters from the player cameras. For a game that cost at premium price (bc yes, it's a premium price for VR applications) you would expect at least, end the tutorial without facing bugs but it's not the case. Not only graphical issues with Occlusion Culling (which could be pretty normal), things being pop-in way after the camera turns, pop-ups not being displayed and some others like SFX not being played in the audiosource or the bgm being stuck, but the main stat panel not appearing, prefabs badly placed on the grid and the tutorial not working even if you made things right. 

In addition, the controls are unintuitive and hard to start playing with them.

Making a game like this is really hard but this is not a gold version at all. I guess the authors published the game now because Little Cities delayed for a month, but I really hope the roadmap fixes the issues because the game is not worth the full price at this state.",Apr 30 at 8:14 PM,3, 5,"Thank you for taking the time to share a detailed review with us!

Familiar things like building roads supplying water and electricity zones and dealing with all the minutia along with it are welcomed. The game has great potential for growth however with that comes very complicated gameplay. Hooking up the houses to electricity and water can be tricky as often times it’s hard to tell whether or not you’ve correctly linked the systems (I’m aware of the icons).

2022-05-27 21:26:17.939079,dearhorse085,"Great introduction to ""Cities"" games.",There is too much pop-in in this game. That really takes away from the experience. Reduce the pop-in and the distorted graphics and I'll give it 5 stars. When I say distorted graphics I mean the big rock prop that when placed on a steep slope changes shape.

2022-05-27 21:26:19.979962,Mr_cheese_og,A good start but not quite there,"Sims are brilliant in VR. You get a feeling of playing God as you swoop across the landscape sculpting the perfect working city.

Cities does just that.

You have several tiers of unlockables which are opened at population milestones. They add extra infrastructure and give you advanced options to available ones. Once you master the income/outcome balance, you can pretty much sit back and build to your desire. The only issue for me is that there isn't enough to do and after a while, it almost loses its appeal. The building offerings are limited which is where it falls short.

Would love to see future updates to bring in new constructions builds that offer new variables.

It would also be great if the info graphs where expanded so that you could see employment rate and other smaller details to add some extra realism.

Still very enjoyable, just needs more, especially based on the price.",A day ago,3, 0,

The only draw back of this game is that most of the time the player is looking down to the city, which can get uncomfortable after some time playing, it would be great to see an option to tilt the map to eyes level so the player don't have to look down all the time to see the city.",3 days ago,4, 0,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review! Our free content update 'Metros & Traffic Routing' is arriving on June 9!

2022-05-27 21:26:24.057352,Passedyouby,Great transition of skylines to the VR,"Great game, but definitely being held back by the hardware of the Quest.   The services and road sections are limited compared to the main game, but this just makes the VR game have a new twist.  

Cities skylines VR makes me feel much more involved in my city than ever before.  I enjoy ""walking"" the streets while laughing at the names the developers gave the shops and manufacturing facilities.  

All in all, good work makeing the game feel true to its roots, and creating a unique interface that actually somehow works!  Other games will take note at your interface ideas! 




Suggestions-
So far I'm struggling to find out how to move buildings and objects. The Vr interface for placing objects is trickier than a mouse. So moving objects for free or a cost is a must have.  

Checking to see your utility utilization is a bit more cumbersome than it should be.  I wish while building a power plant or running water lines it would pull up the bar graph showing utilization.  Going into the designated menu is a bit slow.

Wish we has more tiles to purchase, even if the size of a tile was smaller and we were limited to the same physical footprint, I enjoy being able to choose the direction my city grows. 

3 lane 1 way roads would be great fyi :)

Deeper control I'm sure is coming, but I would love to micromanage my bus lines (number of busses per line ) and other things",25 days ago,5, 2,"Thank you for taking the time to write such a thorough review, we're happy to hear you like it!

It explains the mechanics well without giving away the strategy. Every time I build a new city I come up with better ways of doing things and this keeps me eagerly playing. 

That's what makes management games fun, that you can constantly find new ways to optimize your strategy and Cities VR really capture this.

There are only a few nitpicks I can think of like I personally ""stare down in the floor/map"" too much which ain't good for my neck and the music can be a little annoying at times.

2022-05-27 21:26:30.289303,MyWy,Hobbled City Builder,"Cities VR is alright, and hopefully with some updates it will become good. Its strengths are the very nice simulation with bustling activity, and the ease of use, putting a lot of the bureaucracy on auto-pilot or at least setting safe default values for you if you don't care about budgets. What the game has works pretty well, and I encountered no crashes and only two weird glitches which were fixed by reloading.

Much content is missing, compared to its non-VR counterpart, and some content left in is just pointless (you can't expand your city currently, so the highway and cloverleaf tiles just waste precious space). Much of the minute game control is gone. I wasn't able to create merge lanes (just 3-way intersections), define priority roads, or build pedestrian walkways. Bicycles are forbidden here.

VR controls could be better. Creating bus routes is a pain, because you edit all routes at the same time, they are drawn flat on the road (sometimes disappearing under it), and a slight hand jitter can result in deleting the entire line accidentally. There is no undo.",5 days ago,3, 0,"Hi MyWy, what content do you feel is missing in Cities: VR? We are planning to support Cities: VR with free content updates, feature improvements & bug-fixes.

Figured out the hydro and pipes thing. Went through the tut again. Please make it stationary. Very hard to do stuff with that big tutorial panel in your face.

Also after about 1/2 hour of playing I got a headache and nauseous. The controls should be done like demeo. I play that for hours without a problem. 
End Edit:

I wan to love this game but. The movement is clunky. And I can't connect to power lines or sewers.  The tutorials only gets you to run lines but nothing about how o connect them to things like the power plant. Just says the space is used. No help from discord either.

2022-05-27 21:26:50.829307,Evuldark,"Good fun, but limited","So if you're a PC cities skylines player, this will feel like an extremely cut down version, as it doesn't include any of the mods regular players have come to see as essential. It's like playing the base game with only one tile. Only having one tile makes the use of motor ways essentially pointless, and large cities are therefore out.. it's more like town vr. This is the major downfall, as you'll fill this tile very quickly, and then what's left?? 

With that all said, as a quest game, it's fun and since there are very few other management games on the system, this is far and away the most in-depth of them. But it's limits become apparent fairly fast.

The building system works well, the graphics are okay given how much stuff is going on, however what's odd is how sick the game makes me feel. I have no idea why. I can play far more hectic games with out issue. But for some reason, I start to feel slightly unwell after awhile. You can certainly sink many hours into this chilled out game, and it's nice to have something other than another zombie shooter to play. But many of the down sides reduce its long term play.",7 days ago,3, 1,

Yes the graphics are dumbed down from pc to make it work on the quest, but remember, quest runs on mobile hardware not pc specs.

Controls got a little getting used too, but once I got the hang of it, it became natural to use.

Love the zoom level down to street view, but wish we could walk around like a pedestrian.

Took me a little bit of time to get used to changing the speed. Maybe have a button to bring up a virtual toolbar instead of joystick selecting.

It's not a 10 min have a quick game type of game.
It's a good city builder. Has most of the vanilla option on the pc version so happy. Just hope they bring a mod workshop like in steam because the add-ons do make a huge difference.

And the tiles aren't as large as the pc version so you can fill it up quiet easier than the pc version.

Buildings can become abandoned for many reasons, there might be a lack of good transportation for example, causing the building to get abandoned again and again.

Two bugs I've seen: one is with the cruise ships. Two ships dock at same time and they go into each other's space. Also, they leave port and go right through the bridge supports and when they go off screen, it looks like they are sinking.

In order to make a functioning bus route you have to:
1. Place a bus depot somewhere within your city.
2. Select the ""Bus line"" tool in the same palette menu (it should unlock when a bus depot is placed).
3. Click on a road where you want to place the first bus stop.
4. At this point if you move your pointer along a road a flashing coloured line should follow. This is your bus line.
5. Click to place another bus stop at some point along a road as you did in step 3.
6. Repeat step 5 for as many times as you'd like to create multiple bus stops.
7. Finally go back to the first bust stop you placed down and click on it one last time to create a bus line loop (there should be a warning above that bus stop to indicate it is an incomplete loop).
Redo steps for every independant bus line you wish to create.
To remove a bus stop/bus line segment use right click (the Right hand grip button) on a placed bus stop.
The bus stops will look like little nodes on the road with lines going between them as you make more of them."

2022-05-27 21:28:17.481341,harmitonkana,A fun game with some rough edges,"It's a very decent title and one that feels like an actual game on Quest platform.


While I have no experience in Cities Skylines, I can see what people mean when they say it's a stripped down version of Skylines. What's in the game is mostly very good and enjoyable. It's a slow, peaceful game in which you have time to admire what you've created. There are a surprising amount of city building mechanics included for what is essentially a mobile game. I really like the direction the developers took to aim high instead of dumbing things down too much. 


Due to quite a lot of features, the interface is at the moment a bit tricky to use. A lot of functionality can be found behind the left thumb stick. Selecting the correct option requires a bit of finesse. That being said, the UI is usable but hopefully gets improved. 


While peaceful, there are some penalties to bad city planning. You can run out of money which will essentially force you to restart your city. That's not really a bad thing in my books as it makes decisions more meaningful. 


I've seen criticism toward the graphics and while I agree the color palette is a bit bland, I find the graphics totally ok for a Quest game. Viewing the city on even street level is quite enjoyable for me. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.


Even though I like the game quite a lot, there are some things I'd like to see getting improved. My wish list (beginning of May 2022) includes support for lefties, tuning the controls, being able to walk in the city and eventually adding more content and city building mechanics.

Can you please help me figure out why this happens?",18 days ago,4, 1,"Hey Calexh09. We hope this review eventually becomes 5 stars 🤩. In order to make a functioning bus route you have to:
1. Place a bus depot somewhere within your city.
2. Select the ""Bus line"" tool in the same palette menu (it should unlock when a bus depot is placed).
3. Click on a road where you want to place the first bus stop.
4. At this point if you move your pointer along a road a flashing colored line should follow. This is your bus line.
5. Click to place another bus stop at some point along a road as you did in step 3.
6. Repeat step 5 for as many times as you'd like to create multiple bus stops.
7. Finally go back to the first bust stop you placed down and click on it one last time to create a bus line loop (there should be a warning above that bus stop to indicate it is an incomplete loop).
Redo steps for every independant bus line you wish to create.
To remove a bus stop/bus line segment use right click (the Right hand grip button) on a placed bus stop.
The bus stops will look like little nodes on the road with lines going between them as you make more of them.

Graphics is so good, it’s quite the best game I’ve on my quest right now! It’s so identical with the original game WOW!

If this interface will get into PC Edition, I would pay 59€ just for an DLC!

2022-05-27 21:30:52.570023,kingotho,I love this game,"When I heard this game was coming out, I was skeptical that the developers could recreate the full experience of Cities Skyline in VR. This game knocks it out of the park. I love getting down to street level and seeing the citizens hanging out in their yards, walking over the bridges, and really feeling like you have a living toy city around you. Aside from a few visual glitches, so far it’s been flawless. The UI is great and really well thought out. It’s super quick once you get used to it. 5 out of 5 stars. I can’t wait to play again.",Apr 29 at 1:42 PM,5, 4,"Thanks you for taking the time to leave a review, great to read how much you like it!"

I would change this review if the devs add a more understandable tutorial. So this game just isn’t for me. Might be refunding.",14 days ago,1, 2,"Hey F-Mac50, thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We have just improved the tutorial in a recent patch, however that doesn't mean it's perfect!

2022-05-27 21:31:09.044574,TheJackOfNoTrades,It’s a good city builder what can I say?,"I never really got THAT into any city builder unless you count spacefolk city as one. But it’s a fun time. I played a bit of standard level up, save up, and upgrade loop style but I really enjoyed just turning on unlimited money and all unlocks and going wild just trying to make a huge and thriving city. And I do recommend it!

First off is the visuals. I own a PC I have played Cities Skylines and I loved that game, it was good fun and looked great and detailed. So how does the standalone VR port hold up? Ehh. It’s fine… It’s undoubtedly impressive for the quest with the shadows and just how many buildings are on screen no matter how low poly they are. It’s a impressive showcase for the quest but I am really not a fan that it is currently the ONLY place to play Cities VR. I get the quest 2 is popular but it’s pretty weird seeing a downgrade to a game after playing a 5yr old version that runs on PC. Why can’t there be a PC version that looks just like the OG game? Why must developers limit themselves to the quest when they could make both? I don’t know but as a quest game it’s massively impressive and I think it looks lovely!

And as the last point it’s the changes. I really think they did a great job with porting Cities over but it’s lacking the Mod Support I have come to love. Why can’t there just be a mods tab where you can get some fun stuff or just download other saves? I don’t know if they are working on that or what but right now it’s not here so I am gonna knock it for that. 

Outside of a couple omissions it’s a good port of the Cuties Skylines experience and the scale you get from being down in the road or acting like your standing on a building looking over at your creation. 

It’s not perfect but it is fun.

8.5/10 A good port with solid visuals",Apr 29 at 9:58 AM,4, 3,"Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts, we are happy to hear you are having a good time!

2022-05-27 21:31:15.259454,Pshemson,Works great,"The game runs smooth and it is still Cities Skylines, but from the perspective that makes everything kinda new experience. I really like it. 

4 stars, since it's missing crucial elements like roads management, buying land (probably performance thing but the way it is now you cant edit the highway and there is only one connection to town), tourism, more public transport, more data about the city, graphs and map filters, no terrain modifications and railroads with trains. Also no connection between cities, you can't even name it or place on the map. And no autosave! 

There is more, and for veterans there might be nothing to do after few days of playing, but there are content patchs coming, first one with metro and road managment so seems it's going to get better",12 days ago,4, 0,"Hey Pshemon, Thank you for taking the time to leave this review.

Also, it you are suffering with joystick drift, you will have moments of joy building, and several moments of agrivation because using a joystick that drifts, you will be selecting the wrong things alot. And I mean alot! I started a stopwatch to keep track of my 2 hour window and I honestly feel I spent more time 🍆 around trying to select the right thing than playing the game. If you have a relatively new quest with controllers with pristine joystick accuracy, you should be good. If you are in the other camp, I would pass until you get brand new controllers.",14 days ago,3, 1,"Hey Shizz_DiGG, Thank you for taking the time to leave this review and your feedback is super important for us as a team. The Joystick drift is something we haven't experienced and is more likely a Quest issue such as lighting and reflections interfering with the touch controller tracking. Alternatively you can delete the quest guardian cache in the Quest settings. You will need to redo your guardian setup but this is common fix for the issues you have mentioned above.

Cities VR is a step in the right direction for VR gaming. Sure the graphics are a far cry from the original cities but there is something magical about “cruising” in your small town and see people going about their business, the opening of a new burger joint, the success of Frank with his new booming Frank Fish Factories. At least frank can hire 12 people and pay his taxes!

I am in the long haul with this one and I cannot wait to see what these wizards have in store. A great buy right beside Resident Evil 4.

Great job to the developers.",22 days ago,5, 0,"We feel honored to be your first review! Thank you for the 5 stars!

2022-05-27 21:31:44.031687,teacrumpet,Great game,"Jesus christ this game is amazing. This really caught me by surprise on the level of detail they go into city creation! I will admit, it can be overwhelming and anyone that plays should be prepared for it to take a while to get up to speed. And yes, my one issue is that playing the game kinda hurts your neck after a while. But I freaking love this game and ive only been playing for an hour!

I also wanted to leave a few suggestions for this already amazing, only a few days old game. Just ti be clear im not criticizing this game at all, just saying my ideas. Also if any of these ideas are already in the game, then yay!

- I’d love to see an arcing tool for roads and bridges. Like to help with making circles, and very structural works.

- Another idea is a way to measure exact rectangles of roads. For example, I’ve been having a small issue with making my roads look identical to each other so it would be great to have an easy easy to select an exact amount of road.

- Im sure you guys are already working on manually placed things like in Skylines, but I’d love to see things like larger parks, manually placed buildings, terraforming tools, and other stuff like that.

But yeah, that’s all the stuff and reviews I will say (Since I’m writing this at 2 am lol)",24 days ago,4, 0,"Wow, thank you so much or taking the time to write such a thorough review, we're so happy to hear how much you like it!
