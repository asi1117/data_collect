I had no sound, physics are awful, the bat angle at default is impossible, low textures, the graphics and terrible. Not fun at all. Come on Devs you can do better than this, how can you release in such a state, every one is wishing for the next great Table Tennis game, put it back in the oven.",A day ago,1, 86,"Hello Themerote,

We're sorry to hear you're not having the best experience. We've heard that the audio issue is because the volume is defaulted to off on the initial launch, please let us know if turning the audio on fixes your issue. If you have more feedback we would love to hear from you at techsupport@mergegames.com so that we can better understand how to improve the game."

Buggy and at times confusing interface 
Would be acceptable for a free app, maybe $2",A day ago,1, 22,"Hello Buckerzerg,

2022-05-28 11:58:18.016683,usb420,It's rough,"This is my second favorite ping pong game on PC (my top favorite doesn't have a Quest version)  However the best thing about the PC version were the graphics which are greatly reduced here. And that was the main selling point was the immersive environments.  Aside from the graphics the other thing I like about this game is that it's just easy and fast to pick up and play.
Which carries over to the Quest version.  There are some problems though.

When you start the game the audio defaults to off.  The racket is twisted at a bad angle.
There's a bug where you can't click the restart button.

Feels a bit lazy tbh.  No improvement over the PC version just downgrades.  Physics are ok ish but don't have a very solid feel.  PC version is kind of the same way with that though 

It's the only ping pong game I've tried on Quest so it's hard to say how it compares.  I've tried all of them on PC and most of what I liked about this game does carry over ok.",17 hours ago,3, 4,"Hey USB420,

Glad to hear you're a fan of the title! We would love to here more about the bugs you've experienced if you wouldn't mind emailing techsupport@mergegames.com.

Happy Ping ponging :)"

2022-05-28 11:58:18.080713,everydayimrusselllynn,Don’t make the mistake I did,"Poor quality, horrible matchmaking queue, and annoying glitches/bugs
Terrible graphics. 
The ball they first give you blends in with the opponents paddle.
It says I’ve unlocked skins and look through my items to find I haven’t unlocked anything. 
I haven’t been able to find an opponent in matchmaking for over an hour. 
When you go to restart a game, you have to press the menu button twice to be able to serve or the opponent scores points automatically.

This game just isn’t worth the 16$ I paid. Don’t make the mistake I did. Go buy Eleven for 4$ dollars cheaper.",35 minutes ago,1, 1,
