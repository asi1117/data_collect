2022-05-28 12:03:04.486691,hargisss,Excellent!,"Paint with your fingers, paint with many brushes at once, paint by connecting your brushes to an electric drill, or put your canvas on the floor and pour the paint directly from the can. Splatter paint with your brush... Or hey just throw you're brushes at the canvas! Why not?

This takes me right back to my childhood, when I just had fun making a mess with art utensils and didn't worry about whether I was doing it right.

I have purchased every painting app for quest. I love all of them. The other apps are about achieving an authentic painting experience. Kingspray is about feeling like Banksy. Vermillion is about finding your inner Bob Ross. Painting VR doesn't get hung up over any particular type of painting, or being realistic or authentic. It's all about play and experimentation and freedom.",Apr 15 at 11:37 AM,5, 114,You have a great way of putting things in perspective! Thanks! Enjoy splattering!
2022-05-28 12:03:04.518829,GRNKRBY,Fun But Could Be More Accessible,"Tried a bit of Painting VR tonight. It's definitely a fun sim, but it's got some stuff that I don't like. I will be comparing this to Vermilion a bit.

Where Vermilion is really accessible (you can move around the height of your paints, you can have every brush and erasing tool lined up to your side to be useful and at a height you want), Painting VR is janky and helter skelter in terms of what you can and can't manipulate. Like, instead of a rag to clean stuff, you have two objects: A sponge that cleans the canvas and a can of water that cleans the brushes. The sponge can easily fall to the floor every time I try to drop it somewhere helpful, and the can of water can not be placed on any shelf (as far as I can tell). So every time you want to clean your brush, you have to either pick the can up from the floor or do a full on squat to dip the brush in the can. In Vermillion, you don't even need to use the cloths to clean your brush, you can just tap a button to clean them. There's a space to place some brushes and tools but it's behind your easel (like not even that close to where your easel is to start). And it's a fairly solid structure, again, not like the easily accessible and stable brush space in Vermilion.

You can put your painting on an easel, on the floor, or on the wall. You can further change your painting from portrait, landscape, to square, you can rotate the painting, and even change the width and height pretty fully (to absurd degrees). I need to figure out if there's some kind of ladder or flying button cause your painting can become so giant that you can't reach even halfway up it standing on your tip toes.

It has a lot of variety in the tools (not as much sim as Vermillion though; it has more ""fun"" brushes and tools), but I think more professional style brushes would be welcome. There's a lot of customization in terms of smudge, color mixing, and thickness of the paint, but I think it can get confusing a bit for noobs (cause what exactly does 1.0 mix mean vs 0.5 mix vs 0.2 mix mean? What's smudge mean?). Color mixing itself is also not too simple on the pallet that they give you, this too tiny white board of 7 or 8 very basic colors that you do need to clean off with the sponge (again, be nice if you could use a button to reset the pallet). I think there was green, yellow, white, dark blue, light blue, red, orange, and black. I don't believe there was purple in there or any other crazy colors. There may be another tool I'm missing, so I'm still learning.

So far, I'd say my favorite tools are the roller, the little dollop brush that you can splash paint and water around with, and of course the magnet drill which allows you to MaGyver as many paint tools together as you want seemingly (I had two paint cans and two brushes attached to it, and it worked fine). I think most folks gonna have fun just slapping the canvas with paint making Abstract color art. One paint tool is so nasty though, this gigantic flat brush that makes the most gross noises when you scrub it on the canvas. xD

There's also a giant ace space for your painting, but I don't quite get that (I think there is a way to have multiple paintings out at the same time, but I haven't figured that out). You start in a giant empty skate board park studio space. Just feels a little dead. I think some kind of radio could be nice too (there is a Web Browser in game, maybe your supposed to use that to find music to listen to while you paint). I also wish you could paint the floors and ceilings (even if not permanently, just have some effect on your space briefly, that'd be kinda fun).",Apr 15 at 4:44 PM,4, 40,"Hey! Thanks for your review. You can also control the height of your painting, so no need to stand on your toes :) Maybe it's a good idea to join our Discord. A lot of helping users there, and we're on there as well. 

The big space will make more sense soon :)

If possible i would like to suggest to add to the application, a way so we can fly, so we can paint easier in the case of bigger paintings, to export a file in bigger resolution, let us use color picker tool in the web navigator, better color mixing when a shader between colours in tools.

I LOVE THIS PAINTING APP!! The file sizes are bigger than.. There are so many many ways to paint and you can get a lot of details on the canvas. I am a professional artist. This is an amazing app.. you just need a little patience to get used to moving around and making tools bigger and smaller, etc..The quality you can produce and the feeling is very cool.

Now I know some of the features in the intro have yet to be released because they aren’t quite perfected. Also, for color mixing hold the upper button on the face of the controller to send a beam out that eye drops the color it touches on the brush/can of paint but the brush MUST already have paint on it (otherwise it eyedrops to no medium.) I also learned the tool test in front of the easel is the stick you can attach to the drill as in the video. You can also attach brushes to the small side of the palette! Physics are so much fun, let the paint flow!",Apr 19 at 10:09 AM,5, 5,"Hey! Thanks for your review and the stars.

2022-05-28 12:03:07.849427,manucmm,I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ACCURACY,"I'm a digital painter and my mom is a traditional painter. I've always loved digital painting beacuse I hate how expensive paint can be sometimes, you need more space, you need to wash your stuff, be in a ventilated space, etc.  But I do love the feeling of traditional media, it's relaxing and for my mom that's what digital art lacks off. I made her try tilt brush, she found it fun but nothing more than playing just a couple times, I don't use tilt brush that much either, I prefer quill but I mean I've spent more time on tilt brush than my mom did. But THIS IS REALLY THE MEDIUM POINT, it's unreal how easy and accurate is to draw in a canvas with this, without needing to much physical space, without staining anything, I'm really impressed! I don't know... if headsets weren't so heavy this would probably replace my Cintiq (I mean probably not because I love my Cintiq but I just want to point out how good this app is) MY MOM LOVES IT! She is demanding a Quest 2 for herself lol I mean it is more portable than a graphic tablet, and you have a whole studio, I'm so excited haha",Feb 22 at 11:01 AM,5, 55,Great to read this!

2022-05-28 12:03:07.909387,anitapita,They lied about the refund,First of all  there is no undo button.  So if you mess up you have to start again with a new painting cause you can't undo your last step.  And the brushes always end up across the room and it is so unorganized. I had it for a week and asked for a refund and they denied it although they say they will refund if you have it for up to 14 days. And I know I wasn't on it for 2 hours.

2022-05-28 12:03:11.165490,MasterQ,Game is so good but could be GREAT!,"BUY BUY BUY! If you're in the fence about buying the game, DO IT! There's still so much to be improved but out of the box, it's a heck of an experience. I'm hoping to write a review to hopefully get some quirks fixed in the future. The new update really altered my experience and I'm not really enjoying how I used to (spent nearly 16 hours total playing so far)

1. The new 2-step functions such as undo/redo and brush seeing nearly destroys my experience. Having to press 2 times for those functions adds up and my flow is constantly broken.

2. The quick access menu, if pressed on the right hand shows up on my left hand. That quirk is VERY inconvenient and not ergonomic.  It isn't a feature I want to get forced to use. If menu sounds pop up on the hand requesting it.

3. Lost ability to designate button functions. The quick menu button is a great thought but I'd really like to change my y and b back to undo and redo.


Also, not related to the update, there's no instructions on how to get a can color back to its default or to reset them all. I've mixed my small, white can and now it seems I can't ever use white on brushes except from the pallet.

Overall I think we need more instructions period. It would be great to have granular details on every function available to me. I feel a sense of limitation because I am not getting the guidance the game should offer.

At any rate I am thoroughly enjoying this game despite the quirks and I'm super excited to rush home everyday to get back to my art (I am not a painter/creative)! I hope you consider my suggestions because this game has so much to offer. Keep up the excellent work!",Apr 27 at 1:35 PM,2, 2,"Hey, thanks for the two stars and the review. Are you on our Discord?

2022-05-28 12:03:11.195652,GENXVR,Painting in VR? What's not to love?,"There's a lot of fun to be had with this program, and it's perfect for anyone of any age to use. Plenty of brushes, options...it even has a browser so put on some music from YouTube and have a blast creating!  Highly recommended!",Apr 28 at 8:00 AM,5, 3,Hey there! Thanks for the stars and the very nice words!
2022-05-28 12:03:14.323993,Davive184,Very cool art app,"it's a really cool art app and i like that it's got options to mix or not mix the color on the painting for total control. Web Browser is cool albeit a little Laggy. The tools on disposal are good too! I like the way they made the shading of things on the painting and looks pretty realistic. You have an Undo/Redo option but it's pretty limited in how far you can undo. However there are some things i would like to have in this that aren't in the game.

1. Able to hang paintings on wall.
I saw on trailer that you could hang paintings on wals and have them around.

2. Perhaps more environment (at least 1 new environment)
I like this Skatepark looking area but would love to see some environments if that's possible. maybe bring back the old environment that appeared in the videos before.

3. Being able to save how things are laid out across ALL the paintings.
So you can move things around which is cool. and i like that you can personalize this to your liking but my problem with this is that it's only saved per painting meaning that each painting has it's own layout that you set.

4. A way to change smooth rotation speed.
I would love to change the speed you rotate similar to how you can set you smooth move speed.

Very excited for the multiplayer which is something that you guys are apparently working on (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paintingvr/painting-vr-world).
hopefuly this multiplayer multiplayer will have some way to do text chat as well as i have some deaf/mute friends that i think would enjoy this app.

Secondly, so many bugs in the system; you’ll be painting and will suddenly zoom across the room with your brush dropping without letting it go. So you need to get dizzy navigating your way across the room to pick up your brush, then once again back to the canvas. You start to paint and it just happens again.

2022-05-28 12:03:24.127240,vennishier,Lifesaver + Feels unreal,"I gave myself repetitive strain injuries over practicing drawing and painting. I was getting very sad waiting for recovery and did not have enough space for a big ergonomic setup, but this was the solution. The devs are active and this program is already amazing. I see very promising things in the future for this.  This is different than any medium I've come across. this feels like the future.

Almost everything that is important is fine-tuned and beautiful. The rest is clearly in development. As someone who loves both digital and traditional I've absolutely fallen in love with this hybrid experience. The paint is like acrylic/oil that never dries. With a little adjustment to how you need to move your arm, you can make very VERY accurate strokes. It feels like you're painting traditionally with all the things people beg for irl (wheres the undo button? I wish I could zoom in? COlorpicking, etc). Its beautiful. I love this so much. 

I think much of what I make in here I will move into clip studio for fine tuning once my hand gets better, but for now I can do a lot, and I couldn't do anything before.

It feels much more realistic than I was anticipating. Still can’t believe this kind of thing is even possible.

2022-05-28 12:03:27.414390,GomGom_,"Nice, but some ideas..","Hi, I'm professional illustrator and i pretty like the app, but it would be marvelous to add some tools:
- Masks with various shapes (straight, oval, circle, curve...)
- Ruler for straight lines and compass
- Layers (one or two at least)
- Charcoal
- Oil tubes for diferent colors (and you can save your colours in tubes)
- Differents nozzles for graffity
- Improve the drop paths
- Option for grain of the canvas (grain change and turn off option)
- More brushes and sizes
- Better palette
- Knife tool

2022-05-28 12:03:30.626092,IVS21,Among the very top of creative VR apps,"Best investment I have made so far in any app for the Oculus. Painting VR takes you to another level of reality. And you don't have to be a painter or an artist to enjoy the experience of being in an art studio, equipped with scalable canvases, multiple bushes, rollers, and spray cans, a web browser for reference images or playing music/videos in the background, while using an infinite supply of paint without ever having to clean up any mess. 

While still in Beta, the developers are hard at work to make this ""experience"" as authentic as yo can possibly imagine. You can see the texture and hear thick layers of paint being applied to the canvas while each brush stroke naturally blends fresh paint applied to old paint on the canvas. Join the community on Discord to showcase your work and get valuable feedback, inspiration, and answers from users just like you.

Definitely rate this among the very top of creative apps in VR.",Jan 8 at 7:04 AM,5, 2,

Few improvements/wish list if i could suggest:
Thin brush which smudges like the splatter brush
Maybe some colored pencils with graphite texture to sketch things out
Non splattering brush with texture like the Splatter brush. 

I love the minimal UI. I hope after the app gets out of the lab, we have the option to use the lab version of UI.

Even with “smudge” set all the way down. I can give this 5 stars if there’s a way around this. The paint brush gets other colors on it, or when I interact with another color, say, black, when I have a white brush, it’ll smudge together. No settings change this.

If there’s a way to turn it to its original “physics” in this sense, I’ll give it 5 stars. If a way to fix this exists, or if anyone (or the devs) know how to fix it, please let me know. I can’t use the app until it’s fixed.

2022-05-28 12:03:37.236987,lancaster184,Great for the non artist too,"I have quite a few creative titles on the oculus, sketch vr , tilt brush , graffiti kings, sculpt vr, but I think this is the most enjoyable, the simplicity of just painting is great and feels real, no gimmicks just painting. If you are on the fence just jump in and get it it's defo worth the 6 or £7. It would be great to have a smaller canvas and tiny brushes to simulate painting on an easel maybe a mixing palette so it's all to hand. I see the Devs are very responsive on reviews and I realised this game is still very much in development, if they continue to add and evolve, this is on its was to being even more awesome.
Update: the Devs are great, they have listened and delivered what the user's wanted, we now have a changeable canvas size and easel so you can sit and paint , you can place it on the floor and go crazy on it, or continue to work on a massive canvas on the wall, new smaller brushes and paint pens add another option for detail, you can paint on a tiny canvas and scale it up to a giant size or vice versa, it's awesome. I think the game has been properly released now so costs a bit more but is still a good deal. Less than a few pints and the fun lasts longer.",Oct 21 at 4:10 PM,5, 18,

2022-05-28 12:03:40.496811,fatalflu,Love it,"I have a few digital painting programs that get bogged down by another of tweaking. You can adjust the properties of the brushes. But for the most part I haven't had too. The blending in this is way better then any other program that suits my style. I use my fingers along wile you can't finger paint directly (least I haven't figured out how to) you can use your hands to paint 
 One of the biggest thing is the accident that can happen in painting there is an undo feature but I have tried not to use it. Only thing I would ask for is an auto save feature. I lost something I was painting the first night cause I didn't save and got carried away painting til my quest died. Save should also be a button you press that floats next to the painting instead of in a menu. Oh the the reference imaging is perfect for grabbing a color even mixing paints feels great I know it's on a slider as well but pouring the paint to mix it feels good. I find my self holding one paint can then selecting color and dipping the brush in that more often then just setting up a bunch of colors. Love it and thank you to the devs.",Dec 14 at 1:21 PM,5, 1,

I'm a young aspiring artist and just seeing this program literally blew my mind; I had to get it. I feel like this is probably one of the most amazing art-oriented vr apps on the market, I definitely will spend a lot of time in this game. When I first hit the brush on the canvas my mind was literally BLOWN. It feels almost identical and natural as real painting and the attention of detail from the sleek curve of the brush once it touches the paper to the blending & opacity change feels almost surreal to me. It's an amazing option for starting painters and I could definitely see this as a great tool for teaching those who are newer at painting. I feel like a lot of what stops artists that try to get into artwork such as oil/acrylic paints is the thought of wasting paint, canvas, brushes (these are not cheap) incase it doesn't come perfect the first time and end up in a loophole of hoarding art supplies out of fear of wasting them. Though of course it does have some minor unnoticable flaws here and there, including glitching buckets and more, I definitely do not regret getting this program at all and I'm totally excited for what they have more to bring to this game.",Aug 31 at 2:13 PM,5, 8,

I know its still under development but few more different brushes would be good,, an option to suspend brushes in air rather than having to keep bending down to pick up from floor,,, maybe a handheld menu of brushes ect... Maybe a choice of environments or one we could hang our work in...
I find that the light adjustment option doesn't work properly.. Ie the sun ends up on the floor and impossible to pick it back up....
This app is awesome and can't wait  for the updates..... Review update....just a thought,, is there any chance of adjusting the ambience of the overall room, that effects the lighting direction rather than having a light that is reflecting of off the canvas, because when you have a Finnished piece of work, their is a spot light effect on the canvas, or once the art work is Finnished, have the option to turn the spot light of so it doesn't show on canvas......

The 2 things i don’t like about this game is you cant change the canvas size and when you move your paint brush too fast it glitches out.

2022-05-28 12:04:03.429852,alyssa.mostly,Exciting Potential,"IRL oil painter here, very impressed so far.

Likes:
- The textures, bristle mechanics and satisfying blending with brushes and hands
- Ability to snap turn/teleport backwards to get perspective
- Instant colour grabbing from the colour wheels

Dislikes:
- Not being able to summon items
- No undo button (sometimes teleporting too close creates marks accidentally)
- Unable to resize canvas or the hovering reference images
- The up/down lever is buggy when moved

Suggestions:
- Summon option (especially for wheelchair or mobility issue users)
- Option to disable strathing completely (I'm motion sick after my first session)
- Canvas size and texture options (smooth panel would be dope)
- Adjustable lighting in the factory aswell as board.
- Multiplayer (couches for people to drop in and watch, option for collab style or canvas locked to the host, I also want to throw paint at people)
- Attach the up/down lever to the wall so it doesn't bounce around (if it's not flat the board moves on its own) or add a ladder, or even snap levitate with left controller

The upcoming updates sound exciting, this app is going to be truly awesome when complete.",Aug 29 at 5:02 PM,5, 1,

When I was able to use my hands to mix the colors around on the canvas I started spazzing out from joy. Incredible!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯

This would be life changing if you could somehow make this multiplayer. Even if it was a very basic avatar system in place. Doing a collaborative art project on that enormous canvas with a couple friends would be mind blowing! Pepper in some music and you’ve got a super inspirational creative space! Please! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🗣

Right now me and 2 of my friends all open PaintVR at the same time and chat over the Oculus Audio Party Chat. We can’t see each other but it’s a nice workaround to do art together. It’s a lot of us saying “OH WOW, WAIT WHAT?! AMAZING!” when we discover how to use the brushes. 

I do wish it was easier to “summon” the brushes or paint cans from the ground to you without bending over. I guess the feature is called telekinesis….

If I could rate this higher than 5 stars I would. Best $10 I’ve ever spent.

The spray paint needs some work. Pressure adjusting, caps, opaqueness, and the spray it self is very uniform and not very spray paint like. The roller is a little Janky when you try and do curves. Then you smear your piece lol. I tried to do a calligraphy style letter and it worked for some aspects but not others. The blending with the brushes is pretty sick. The mixing of paint for a color palate is a little annoying but I understand what you were going for. I work In kingspray all the time and found this game to have more creating options and tools, but lacked the smoothness with that kingspray has specifically. The brushes however work awesome and are like procreate ones. I haven't tried to upload any references yet but I assume it'll be as easy as everything else was. Overall, with a little polishing this could be pretty darn powerful as a creation device! Awesome work guys. Can't wait for future updates!

2022-05-28 12:04:13.176532,Maxsayo,The feel of painting.,"I only played this for about an hour but what was there is incredible.  The way the brushes trail on the canvas and the slight vibrations of the controller to simulate the texture of the canvas as you brush does wonders for immersion.

The only issue I ran into (quite literally)  is that it was very common for my character to move up too close to the canvas and the brush would accidentally press against it leaving unintended spots that I'd have to correct with white paint.  

I assume these are coming in the future but I think a few features to add which would go a long way are, railing or some kind of player set barrier so that we don't run too close into the canvas if we don't want to. (As someone who is of the unpopular opinion that doesn't want undo buttons)  i figure this would go a long way to fix mistakes. 

A painter's palette, along with tube paint. it would help to stay focused without having to step away to grab different colors. 

Finally, palette knives so that we could emulate everyone's favorite perm haired painter.

Regardless of my own desires this is everything I wanted in a painting app and I wholly recommend this game to any amateur and professional painters alike.","Jun 9, 2021 at 1:53 AM",5, 5,Thanks for the review! We're taking notes! :)
2022-05-28 12:04:13.209315,limnmus,Really Good but Has Some Issues,"Before saying anything, I’d like to remind anyone reading that the game is in early access still and many of the problems I’m listing will be fixed in the future, but if you plan on buying this game you should know about it’s issues, even in early access. 

First off, the positive: the game is an amazing way to paint. The physics of the brushes and paints and the canvas are really really smooth, and it feels good to paint. It’s not glitchy or jittery (except for some brushes, but it warns you that the brushes aren’t stable beforehand) and it reminds me so much of painting in real life. Even for someone that isn’t an experienced artists, or someone that isn’t an artist at all, this game is awesome. 

It does have some issues, though. For one, exporting your artwork is a pain. You have to connect the quest to your computer and run through the files until you find your screenshots. Then you can export it. There is no way to export your artwork outside of this, no in-app way. Also, finding info on how to get around these problems is also very difficult, I had to go to the dev’s website, then join their discord, and then look through that to see it. There isn’t much info in game at all to tell you what to do, other than a quick tutorial on how to use the menu and control the tools. Besides all that though, the game is very cool, and I’m looking forward to seeing it improve. To the developers, I would also reccomend considering putting different types of paint in the game. I would love to see watercoloring in this game with genuine water physics and paper physics and all that. It would be amazing to have a game like that. That’s all, thanks for reading!","Jun 26, 2021 at 10:37 AM",3, 2,Thank you.
2022-05-28 12:04:13.241566,O_z_,"Extremely promising, but","EDIT: see undo
First of all, this is a lot of fun. 

Very good : Biggest plus is that the tools feel amazing and accurate. I can't stress that enough. 

Just good : Colors could be easier to manage. I'd like an additional palette or two, with common oil paints in simple swatches for example, but that can be added easily enough by the user. 

So-so : Moving is quite fast for my taste, I'd prefer a slower pace more like walking for this kind of application. I've run into the canvas brush first several times haha. I believe settings for this are going to be added soon though. 

Not so good : not much really. Had some slight weirdness with the blurring brushes, saturating colors beyond what was both on the canvas and the brush, which is something I've seen in other realistic painting apps as well.

The main issue is lack of features. As of now, it is a toy. It's excellent and it's very likely it'll become THE painting app for vr, but not yet. 
What I feel is missing in order of importance : 
- Some undo/redo functionality is a must imo, despite being ""unrealistic"". EDIT: dev on undo : ""no. Just... no"", updated rating. 
- An easier way to manage the tools, for example the ability to stick any number of tools to your waist or non-dominant forearm. It doesn't need to be fancy, just have the tool stick on a general area and move with you, instead of dropping on the floor. 
- Maybe some sort of mixing palette tool, or failing that, to stick reference images to yourself as described above, so you have a color picker readily available.
- I like the lever, but I'd like the ability to raise or lower the canvas with some sort of gesture as well. Though that point is moot if the lever was stuck somewhere on me, and readily available, as described above, on my belt for example.
- An eraser or a cloth to wipe with, or something to that effect. Minor, you can always just paint over, but removing paint may be useful too, esp with mixing.","May 9, 2021 at 1:49 AM",2, 16,"EDIT: WE HAVE UNDO! :) Thanks for your patience. 

EDIT 14/05: The wind is slowly turning.. We'll soon let the community decide whether they want and undo function or not. :) 

Thanks for your input. It's not about purism or realism, it's about us being convinced that no undo makes you think differently about your creation process. And that's an important part of our mission: creating an environment that makes you think differently."

2022-05-28 12:04:16.389439,JR4D,Very impressive,"I watched a gameplay video of the app and wasn't sure how well painting would translate in VR and initially thought $10 was a bit steep.

After trying it out, I'm genuinely impressed with how well the painting mechanism are. They're incredibly natursl, well thought out and realistic. It's Far better than I anticipated and definitely worth every penny. 


Stuff id like to see in future updates:

-Multiplayer

-A music player similar to top golf/real VR fishing would be cool too

-additional venues would also be cool. Maybe even have some outdoor locations

-user experience settings to remove vignetting and adjust item interaction mechanics. (Theyre using mechanics where the items are locked in place. It's more immersive when you hold the grip button and release to drop items.)

Outside of that, it's still the absolute best painting experience available on VR and has far surpassed any and all expectations that I had for a VR painting simulator. The graphics and painting mechanics are lifelike and just feel incredibly natural. The devs did a great job on this one.. The second they add the settings to remove the vignette (which they already said is planned), im changing the review to a well deserved 5 stars. Until then, it's a 4.","May 6, 2021 at 10:53 PM",5, 13,

However too my surprise I've been having a fun relaxing time just doodling random honestly terrible paintings, I think not having to worry about the cost of paint just let's me have fun without having to set high expectations for myself.

2022-05-28 12:04:16.516748,MrMunson,Outstanding,"I came across a clip of this game whilst on reddit and was immediately taken aback by how realistic the brushes looked on the canvas. There aren’t many painting games it seems for the quest however this is truly something.

It genuinely feels like you are painting and have complete control over what’s going onto the canvas. Being able to mix the different pots of paint to make your desired colour is fun, as is extending the roller to reach the high parts of the canvas.

There are many different brushes so you can experiment and spend hours getting everything just right.

I planned on trying it out for 15 minutes, and when I eventually took off the headset I realised it had been 3 hours.

A good tip by the way is to play it whilst listening to music. Takes the experience to another level

Would love to see few things added in the future

. Built in media player similar to VR Fishing
. A gallery environment to see all of you paintings and also other people’s paintings.
. New Environments 
. Different Size Canvases 
. And of course an undo button (absolute must)

2022-05-28 12:04:19.707378,LiteByte,Needs Undo...Desperately (Devs Read Pls),"I understand the idea of creating an environment where one must be considerate of their work process. Without an undo, you as an artist will work with mistakes and have to accept them as part of the process. But, not everyone that plus is an artist and is fine with that mentality. If a real life painter could have an undo option, I’m sure most would take it.

I get what you guys are going for, but most people don’t appreciate the concept behind not having an undo. So, why not make it a feature that the player themselves can enable/disable. That way, players who want to challenge their approach to art can have no undo/redo, but players that want a casual experience can have it. This makes both sides happy without ruining the feeing you want artists to experience when playing. This is just listening to what the fans of your game wants and gives players more options. 

I can guarantee adding an enable/disable feature for undo/redo for the players would make everyone happy while still allowing those to challenge themselves without the ability to undo. Of course, this idea only works if the reason you didn’t add the undo/redo is because of the concept behind the game. If you didn’t add it because it would actually be really hard to implement, then that’s a different story and should just be said that way to the reviewers.","May 11, 2021 at 1:40 AM",4, 8,

But there is work to be done.. 1) urgently I need to have the possibility to insert any of my photos on the surface to be painted as a guide for painting, with ""apply image canvas"" it is possible to do  something like that, but it's not good because: a) it interferes with the colors of the painting. b) it cannot be rotated, scaled, positioned as desired.  c) I cannot hide it at will.  The ideal solution would be to be able to manage these guide photos as separate layers from the work surface.  It would be even better to be able to create multiple layers with multiple photo.. by doing so, scaling and positioning the content of each individual layer, it becomes possible to have an overall guide image full of elements (for example: on a layer I have a  tree, a house on another, and so on.) 2) it is mostly aimed at murals….  actually from the name of the app I expect to be able to paint pictures of any size with oil paint .. being able to use tools and brushes for oil painting .. this would be much more beautiful and enjoyable.

I've never been able to draw sing or anything remotely in the category of ""the arts"" I never had interest in it either, I always said its cool. Some people are good at it but that's just not me. So why on earth did I purchase a painting game/simulator? Well that's a solid question I admit, I think its curiosity more than anything else, that and the desire to try something new. So what do i think? Well ive been painting for a total of roughly 5 hours now and have made several small pieces, the first one bordering 3rd grader level and slowly improving slightly. im probably around untalented 5th grader currently, but yknow what im having fun and i really like what i made even though it isnt top tier. So personally i love the game/sim. Now im no artist so i cant tell you how amazing or perfect the art physics are and paint mixing etc, im not qualified. i am however a VR vet and have more hours then i can count in VR, this game/sim has a fantastic foundation but a long way to go, especially in the settings department (they have an update situated for august to address this). movement is fine but locked to your head direction, items lock in your hands (toggle grab) and vignette is always enabled (awful imo so i just teleport) it plays great sitting or standing even in a very confined space (airplane works well) and there are a few small things like currently you cant reset paint colors to their original state which gets annoying. all these small things im confident will be fixed, however till then i have to dock a star.

It feels very intuitive and really gives you the impression of getting your hands dirty. The texture looks amazing and with a bit of practice everyone can show of their paint doodles or masterworks. What's also cool is the detail you can put in by adjusting opacity with the paint thinner, and using light strokes to give more depth on what you're doing. Can't wait untill the throwing paint functionality comes out.

My other concern is with the canvas sizes although I’ve seen that the summer build will contain smaller versions (much appreciated).

 I can get cleaner details and I don't feel like this game is easy. Thus giving a smooth challenge. By that I mean, there are no preset colors, you must mix your own. There is no undo button. Something I've become accustomed to. And some of the brushes at the moment, are slightly unstable. 

This is game to put in simple terms is awesome. I love the brushes, the enormous canvas and colors, the fact you can have references and just go wild. 

But there are some features I personally believe is missing. Such as the undo button and a simple color menu. Along with preset colors.

Having said that, it's very successful as an ""affluent artist"" simulator: I got a really nice feeling of the scale of the big canvas and the sense of freedom that this 4*3m piece is not costing money so I can felt experiment. Plus endless paint that you can drip on the floor and not worry about waste? and a huge, clean studio ...with sofas?  very rewarding in itself, I am not joking!! And I loved the sound the brushes made on the canvas! You get to feel like you are some established artist with good funding and a real disregard for money!! Luxury simulator: artist edition.

Now there are issues of course since it is a work in progress but it's already very polished! there is one thing however that needs to be addressed: there are glitches in a few brushes, that sputter paint far and wide (and not only those that inform you they are unstable) and the non existence of an undo option for these glitches is a problem.

2022-05-28 12:04:52.590046,alexander.sedig,Alot if potential,"Amazing app, I've been waiting for something like this since I first tried vr. The paint feels especially well done, and mixes nicely on the canvas. In the future id love to have an hsv slider,  using the paint buckets it's pretty novel at first but gets tedious quick,  especially since your hands constantly get stuck inside the the buckets model. Using the color selector is cool, but it doesn't show you what color is currently selected, which makes it hard to make slight adjustments to a colors value or saturation.

   Personally I feel like the attempt to make things feel like painting in real life kinda cripples the app, vr controls just aren't there yet. It would be amazing to see something more like photoshop that embraces a more standard digital paint interface. Being able to paint on life size canvases and being able to hold and  turn and twist the brushes is enough, we don't need to play pretend were pouring buckets of paint together.","Jun 19, 2021 at 9:20 AM",3, 1,"Thank you for your review.

And the rollers do help cover more space for the canvas. The issue itself though is the canvas size. You can move the canvas and teleport across the map but when it comes to painting something simple, your limited. Yes, you could technically make a small area of the canvas be your painting limit, but then it makes the piece look really ugly. I remember taking a small look around the main area.

However there are a couple things that would really put it over the top. 

1. Maybe its there but i cant find it. It would be nice to be able to grab stuff from across the room or at least without having to bend over.

My biggest wish list for this though:

The ability to turn using the stick and not just by physically moving
More than one canvas size - I want to make smaller pictures 
Better brush labeling/organization
Different types of paint - oils, watercolors, etc - and maybe color mixing that was more like a traditional paint palette","May 6, 2021 at 1:19 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 12:04:59.012434,PinkGrease,Far better than I expected!,"Finally a break from using controllers as guns, and realize that using a paintbrush is just as satisfying to control, if not more. 

Really great physics, it feels really realistic, as good or even more realistic than Kingspray, still it has far more tools. 

I know it can seem a little cumbersome not to have a re-do function, but theres no redo button in real life, and you just have to struggle the way any artist struggles in real life. In fact I think it's realistic enough to do actual classical painting with, Rembrandt style. 

I have no complaints, only suggestions as this has so much possibilities, such as some toolbox that could be moved a little closer to the canvas. A fun painting tools, action painting, such as paintgun, spinart, stamps, for when one doesn't feel like planning out work, but just to mess around. 

I'm looking forward getting back into some painting, putting on some music and just enjoy, and sharing the result with the community.","May 21, 2021 at 5:38 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:04:59.044334,benwilks2020,Well worth the 10 bucks,"I have a LOT of apps and this one is definitely in my top 5. Simple concept, you’re in a studio with a giant canvas and a bunch of paint - man is it fun. Unlimited paint and canvas! Very realistic and smooth. Would love to see different environments and the ability to have YouTube running in the corner like in VR fishing. Good job devs, I plan on spending a lot of time in your world.","May 18, 2021 at 1:27 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:04:59.077150,Girthor,A lot of potential!,"I like what i'm seeing so far. As a painter, the paint physics are accurate, and very intuitive. I like the difference between dry and wet canvas, and the brushes are awesome to use! What I did paint felt natural and intuituve!

 I would like to see more features to optimize the workspace. Moving to and from a shelf 10 fert away to fumble with paint cans dragged the experience. I feel most painters try to keep their supplies prepped, and as close as possible. The current framework could benefit from a simulated modular workflow. Like more surfaces, and better applications for mixing paint. A physical simulation of a pallette with the ability to add colors or mix colors with a palette knife would be amazing. 

As it stands I totally recommend Painting VR. Great paint simulation with a ton of room for growth.","May 17, 2021 at 2:41 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:04:59.109824,bunnystick,Fun as heck! Even with the kinks.,"I saw it on twitter and I had to give it a whirl. Once you get used to how the tools behave, it's a fun and relaxing time. There is no undo feature, of course. But that's not a deal breaker for me. The real paint it's trying to simulate doesn't have an undo either. 
I look forward to see how this app develops. I'll happily be streaming this in art discords! 
If I had one criticism I wish could be addressed, it would be that the movement is very sensitive. Because of it I have accidentally painted the canvas more than a couple times. 
Big recommend for 2d artists!!","May 15, 2021 at 10:28 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 12:04:59.142098,D00GIE,Actually pretty impressive,"Is it perfect, no but I think it will get close in time. I had small expectations when I bought this and expected to play for 10-15 min. I played around with this for over 2 hrs straight. 

This feels good and the control over the brush feels better. I can actually paint something that im happy with. The mixing of the colors feels natural and fun. I highly recommend this.","May 7, 2021 at 9:57 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:05:02.318657,kababowie,Painting awesomeness,"I almost cried the first time i touched the canvas. Can't remember when was the last time digital painting felt this good. You nailed the painting experience for me! Blending is lovely, variety of brushes, rollers and sprays is enough for me to do whatever i want. I can't wait to see more updated and stability updates, as there was occasional stutter here and there, but nothing that would thow you off or make you sick. Thank you guys so much for this app!","May 7, 2021 at 3:45 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:05:02.358031,gomesh1977,Fantastic App,"This app mimics real world painting really well.  The feeling of painting in VR's very satisfying.  It'd be great to be able to be able to resize the brushes (Or is there a way around at the moment?), pick color directly on the left menu panel,  undo.  Over all, an excellent VR experience.","May 6, 2021 at 12:38 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:05:02.390016,GTHobbes,Great Painting App,"Adding a Spotify or YouTube app within the app (like RealVR Fishing or TopGolf VR) would be great, but otherwise love it.  Thanks Devs!","May 6, 2021 at 9:18 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 12:05:02.422502,esee_weeey,Great simulator,"This game is extremely well done, with lots of potential, I would love the idea of having a media player (YouTube) so I can either listen to some music, or watch a bob Ross episode, that would be so great, also adding different sizes of canvases","May 7, 2021 at 6:37 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:05:02.455032,UnclePluck,Love it,I agree with the other's it's amazing so far but things I would like to see are comfort options so I can turn off the Vignette when I walk and a music player of some type.,"May 6, 2021 at 5:43 AM",5, 2,
