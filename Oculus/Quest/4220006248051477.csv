2022-05-28 11:58:20.160917,AndysVrReviews,Great new fantasy game,"In this story driven campaign you play as Lord-Arcanum a faithful follower of Sigmar the god king. Your quest begins after an attack known as the Necroquake which triggers a massive explosion of dark magic which causes the Nighthaunt forces (floating skeletons) to rise up all across the Mortal Realms. 

The game consists of your journey to restore order to the mortal realm in the name of Sigmar. There is also gameplay offered in the form of a wave-fighter area called Storm Trials. It is still in beta but I wanted to mention it because it offers a good amount of gameplay on its own. 

This game is perfect for VR. Talking to gods, going on a quest, capturing souls, fighting the nighthaunt forces is all obviously very visually appealing but even the stuff like opening a 50 foot tall castle door is awesome to do in VR. There were countless times that rather than proceed forward I would have to stop and stare at the environment because of how cool it looked. 

The game offers both free movement and teleportation. I do not see an option for left handed support but in this specific game I am not sure if it is necessary. You summon weapons using both hands so there is never really a time you would have to select a dominant hand. 

I received the game yesterday so I am only a few hours into the campaign. From what I have seen so far, it definitely seems worth the $24.99. The game is not perfect, there are more invisible walls then I would like and enemy stuttering could get annoying but overall the game has a great story, beautiful environments and is loads of fun in VR. Games like this are the reason I love VR so much.

https://youtu.be/A7_R8AxxpCI

Absolutely fantastic game.  Amazing voice over and music and it looks great in there.  The scale is seriously impressive and while I expected graphics to be scaled down for the Quest 2 I was still pretty impressed.  The mechanics in my opinion almost feel better then the PCVR counterpart and the weapon customizing is prettt darn good.  Def would recommend to fans of the franchise or newcomers.",8 days ago,5, 37,
2022-05-28 11:58:20.227089,VirtualStrangers,This game looks amazing on the Quest 2,"Wow! Really can't believe they were able to bring this to the Quest from PC. The Gameplay and combat are a perfect match of the pc version if not a little better. The Visuals, while they are definitely not as good as on the PC are definitely some of the most impressive and stunning on the standalone headset. The size and scope of some of the set pieces will have you marveling at the environments. With added features over the pc version plus the full campaign,  this game is a steal at 24.99. Well done Carbon studio's",8 days ago,5, 29,
2022-05-28 11:58:20.258010,BigXoon,"Good, fun game","You gotta love the graphics and locations. Casting spells is really cool and quite intuitive, although I needed a few tries to get them under control. I kinda like the weapon upgrade system, though I only upgraded the sword to tier two so far. Overall the game looks fun, I only hope there will be more opponents in the later stages. You could also add more player-NPC interactions, but again, maybe it will be a thing in the further levels.",8 days ago,5, 28,

The deep, dark vibe, undead crawling everywhere, collecting lore-books (guilty, I am a lore geek), story, and cool main characters lines - it feels like a true RPG.

2022-05-28 11:58:23.529630,Michael W Butler,Warhammer age,I just started playing the game yesterday. I read the reviews of people who have already played this game. Some of the reviews tend to be a little harsh. The story graphics gameplay is awesome im so excited that I bought this game. I want to take my time and enjoy the game. Yes you do feel the sword play. And spell casting to me is awesome why do these people have to be so harsh about this game. They need to chill and take your time and enjoy the whole experience. That’s what I intend to do it’s worth the money and the fun is figuring out what’s going to happen. Buy IT ENJOY IT ten stars to the developers great job.,4 days ago,5, 11,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCuRU7P8c08

My Initial Impressions:
A lot of the jank I experienced on PC has been fixed and sorted. The developers have done an amazing job to bring this game to Quest 2, but again they have had to make some major cutbacks, like graphics and number of enemies.
I am also a big fan of the new Rogue-Like game mode, it adds so much value and replayability to the game.",8 days ago,4, 26,
2022-05-28 11:58:23.583514,namekuseijin,very impressive,"don't let pcvr fanbois and physics toys tinkerers fool you, this is as close to a Bethesda game as it gets. Full game, with actual challenge, some exploration (though mostly linear), a nice story set in the Warhammer universe, and yes even pretty good graphics on Quest - from videos you can't tell, but there's actual metallic shine on weapons and armors and landscapes feel large and open. 

Streambois will tell you there's no physics or weight to combat, but this is wrong: you can block incoming attacks Until you Fall fashion with good timing and in the right direction and plus spell-based attacks like the piercing sword feel very impactful. This is not a physics toy playground to stack up bottles and cups or chop passive ragdolls, this is a real game with fierce enemies - those streambois are playing pathetic easy mode with tutorials and holdhanding and saying it's too easy, d'oh...

summing up, impressive and good game. Please bring whatever trickery you got here to The Wizards Dark Times, Carbon Studio.",5 days ago,5, 10,
2022-05-28 11:58:23.613441,moibuspm,Stop releasing broken games,"Im tired of this practice in the game industry where they release broken glitchy games and decide to just add patches along the way over several months! We are paying customers and NOT your game testers. We are paying you for a finished product. People that are buying your game on release day and who are SUPPORTING YOU, are the ones getting screwed out of an awesome experience. The whole game industry is guilty of doing this and Im tired of it! Of course games arent going to be 100% bug free but come on....NONE of the spells on the weapons work! It glitch on the 1st tutorial and I had to restart it. The animations of the enemies crawled to like 3 frames per second. I upgraded my weapon and text kept going across my screen saying ""weapon upgraded"" over and over and over and over again and sounds looping over and over as the text kept popping up. I cant allow you to keep my money and have to request a refund. FIX YOUR DAM GAMES!!!",4 days ago,1, 17,"Hello, Moibuspm!

We are sorry to hear the game did not live up to your expectations. The issues you described will be thoroughly investigated by our QA team - you're the first player to report problems with spells, low-fps opponents, and floating text, so we will definitely test them again. We want to thank you for your feedback and we hope you will give Tempestfall a second chance in the future. Cheers!"

Definitely not boring. Time well spent. If you like fantasy worlds, don't think, buy and have fun ;-)",8 days ago,5, 16,
2022-05-28 11:58:26.776219,sindred,Needs some work.,"I'm keeping it and not getting a refund because I definitely see potential. And the Sisters game ended up great after some updates. 

But VR (and Quest fans in particular) are WAY too forgiving, giving everything a 5/5 just because it's VR and the experience is always moving at first. But now that we have a few years under the headset, we have to expect more. 

Framerate issues and shoddy collision detection and animation makes this feel like a year-one VR game. You swing and seleton or wraith animate in the same way. Blocking doesn't feel genuine and this doesn't really feel like an rpg. It's more linear. Though admittedly I'm waiting to play more until some of the presentation issues are fixed. I do believe they will, and this game can still be awesome. But handing out 5s just lets developers know that they don't have to try to polish their work because VR should be enough. 

It's not anymore.",3 days ago,2, 12,"Hi, Sindred!

Most of all, we are glad you think our game has potential. We would also like to thank you for your understanding and for giving us the chance - Tempestfall is sure to improve (based on your feedback) with the next patches and fixes. We bear in mind all the issues you mentioned and we will do our best to solve them as soon as possible. Cheers!"
2022-05-28 11:58:26.808132,VRReviews,In the Name of Sigmar!,"Check out my video review here: https://youtu.be/EZ7ivZiFbO4

Or just search for the YouTube channel “VR Reviews”.

This is my impression after playing about 4 hours of the game. The game is said to take about 8-10 hours to complete.  

You play a 9 foot superhuman warrior called a Stormcast. Your quest is to investigate a massive explosion of dark magic that has triggered the Nighthaunt forces to rise up all across the Mortal Realms.

I am going to spend most of my time talking about combat because that’s really where the core gameplay is. So the combat is good, but it’s certainly not the best combat experience I’ve had. There’s some good strategy and timing elements as you need to parry at the right times and choose the best combination of weapons/magic for each encounter. You can also pull off some cool moves like tearing off skeleton heads and throwing the bodies at their comrades.

Combat can get a bit repetitive though, especially at the beginning of the game when there isn’t much variety of enemies (the variety and difficulty of enemies does increase as the game progresses). Sometimes the gestures used to trigger magic attacks don’t work and I found some collision detection issues too. Also, the AI can be a little stupid at times and whilst the wheel based weapon selection is fine, it can be a bit clunky, especially when in combat. But as I say, combat is still good, but it is let down by these things.

As for everything else, it has nice visuals that nail the Warhammer feel, an engaging story, a lot of movement and comfort options, and plenty of content which includes an arena fighting mode called storm trials. Storm trials is a fun addition that sees you fighting waves of nighthaunt of increasing difficulty. With each wave you complete you chose a reward that helps you progress. 

Overall, I think it’s a great game if you can overlook some of the flaws with the combat. For Sigmar!",8 days ago,4, 15,
2022-05-28 11:58:26.837058,ClaudiusMaximus89,Great Game,"I just started a series for this game on my YouTube channel,  Bigman89, and I love it.

2022-05-28 11:58:26.867973,Glaxa,Pretty bad,"I was hoping for a game with good physics but its just bad there is no weight to anything weapon don't collide with each other. its just wigling my sword till their hp drop, Also magic kinda wack. don't recommend buying this if your looking for an fun fighting game. Just go for blade and sorcery or even Gorn",7 days ago,2, 7,"Hey, Galaxa1!

Thank you for your feedback - we will take a closer look at the elements you mentioned and see if we can improve them in the future patches. We want the combat and spellcasting system to be as fun and immersive as possible, so we find your opinion very valuable!"

I’ve already played through the entire campaign on PC, so this rogue lite addition, Storm Trials was perfect. I don’t even like rogue lites/likes, but I found myself hooked to Storm Trials. And to think, it’s still in beta. Amazing job guys.

We are sorry that the tutorial and the spellcasting system did not live up to your expectations. We know that casting spells can be a bit difficult at first, but we believe that after the first few attempts you will discover the pattern behind them. Please follow the tutorial carefully and try again. In the meantime, we will re-test the spellcasting system and see if there is a way to adjust it better. Thank you!"
2022-05-28 11:58:33.305724,WielkiZderzacz,"Great, atmospheric game!!!","I’m enjoying it a lot so far! This is really a case when the developer put great attention to story and mood building, and the result is spectacular.

The control system takes a little time to get used to, but once you do, it works very intuitively. The sword fighting is ok, but could use a little more tuning - like more „forgiving” blocking , but tighter timing -so it’s easy to block you have only THIS EXACT second to counterattack. I like the fact that is is not physics-based buth rather „Dark Souls”, timing-based, which worked perfectly for that game. I hate the Blade & Sorcery model:)

what I would maybe wish for in future uodates are new enemies and more behaviour patterns.

Overall - a fantastic, climatic fantasy game giving me lots of fun!:)",3 days ago,5, 5,
2022-05-28 11:58:33.337463,CzarekPieczarek,Cool adventure with minor combat issues,"It’s ok I guess. I’m aware that the adventure and story should play first fiddle in this type of games but I can't help but notice that the combat needs some polishing. While striking and casting magic is simple, blocking is sometimes clunky and random. 

But as the very first Age of Sigmar game on the Meta I have to admit the graphics look amazing, I enjoyed the Storm Trials and can’t wait to see more of this mode (it’s currently in beta it seems). 

I am also very glad that we get to see more established IPs on the Meta Quest and therefore I give this one a solid 4/5",8 days ago,4, 9,
2022-05-28 11:58:33.366912,tinymanmyboy,Good game my first Warhammer game,Graphics look great gameplay is great they're pretty good upgrade mechanics for weapons. voice actors or good. story is really engaging I'm really enjoying it so far. weapons do have a little weight to them seems a little floaty when you fight enemies but the enemies I'm fighting so far are ghosts and skeletons which would be weightless so maybe they're not supposed to have a sense of weight when you hit them. Overall for the quest 2 it's a great game your hands do go through the walls but that's not a selling point I wish the screen didn't get black when you walk too close to a walls but also not too big of a problem just little flaws in the game that could be fixed with little updates will be playing more Warhammer games after this. good job to the developer glad to see you're still working on games for VR keep the good work up. Glad I decided to buy this on day one.👍👍👍👍👍,6 days ago,4, 4,
2022-05-28 11:58:33.402816,Eolian Minstrel,Very good with potential to be perfect,"Visuals are one of the best on OQ2 - especially lighting and enemies. Physics and collisions could use some tweaking - i.e. weapons crossing each other or going through objects. The movement is super smooth but it would help to have a slight ""wobble"" - it feels like we are just sliding through air... But the sound, gameplay, atmosphere, is nothing short of amazing. The checkpoint save system is very good and allows you to play the game in smaller chunks at the time. With a patch or two, I would gladly give this promising title a full 5 stars.

Please creators this game has alot of potential but you ought to make it play friendly.",3 days ago,3, 2,"Hello, Poonslayer377

Thank you for reporting the problem. We are aware that the first spellcasting approaches may not be easy and we will do our best to improve the tutorial to be more transparent and helpful.
