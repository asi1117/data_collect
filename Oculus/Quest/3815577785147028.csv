2022-05-27 21:41:06.214191,Beardo Benjo,A TOUGH & rewarding survival game!,"Oh Green Hell VR, you beautiful beast! I was really apprehensive about this one, after playing the PC VR demo my excitement dropped off a cliff, the poor optimisation and glitchy interacts left me feeling underwhelmed and scared for the full release but here we are on Quest 2 launch day and I'm stunned by the difference in quality from that demo to this standalone version. How they have managed to squeeze the entire campaign (all 20ish hours of it) onto the Quest 2 whilst giving players some of the most impressive visuals and immersive soundscapes on the platform feels like pure magic to me and I tip my hat to the entire development team for pulling this one off.

This isn't a casual survival game, let's just say that straight away, this is a hard game that pulls no punches, a game that teaches players by first punishing them, during my first play session (which was around 3hrs) I died to poison from spiders & snakes, I died from eating some berries which made me vomit uncontrollably and I died to a cheetah that slashed me to pieces. My first death was just over an hour into my playtime, I had not built a shelter and therefore had not saved my progress...I lost it all and learned that this game has no autosaves the hard way.

Every defeat is a victory in disguise as you learn more about the mechanics and inevitably become better equipped to push on deeper into the jungle and overcome the next set of challenges. My only gripes at this stage are:

- Some have reported performance drops later into the campaign
- It's often difficult to figure out exactly how to cure certain ailments, for example my character kept complaining about being hungry, I ate four thousand bananas and 6 million coconuts but nothing could fill his endless void of a stomach
- It's not always obvious where to go or what to do next leading to lots of aimless wandering (this could actually be seen as a positive, it feeds directly into the hardcore survival difficulty curve of the game)",Apr 8 at 4:08 AM,4, 1891,"Thanks a lot for your extensive feedback and review, we appreciate it truly! We go way back and thanks for supporting the development of Green Hell VR throughout all the hard and better times :) We will look into the issues you've mentioned, especially performance-related, so we can continue improving the game to bring it to its best shape! Stay tuned for those patches :)"
2022-05-27 21:41:08.276918,madgamer101,Very fun but different that expected,"So I don’t know about you but I have been waiting for this game ever since I heard it was coming to VR. Even though the game is a lot of fun there are a few things that you should know.

This game is hard. Even on the recommended difficulty setting for the first hour I was struggling to keep my health above half. Your proteins and thirst decrease insanely fast so when you first start and there are all the new plants and crafting recipes you kinda get overwhelmed.

Next is the gameplay. The story is incredibly fun and very immersive. I got sucked into it about three hours in. The crafting in this game is a lot of fun and the graphics are pretty good for a game on the Quest. But the handling in this game is kinda clunky. Instead of grabbing what your controller in nearest it grabs whatever you have selected which makes grabbing sort of frustrating. Items can get stuck in the ground and some of your items just go flying. I threw a spear at a snake and it just bounced off and went flying. I never saw that spear again.

One of my biggest issues is that since this game is in VR and on the Quest, there are a few things that had to not be included that I kinda wish were in here.  The biggest thing is the map size. In the console game the map is really large and open but in this you have to follow specific paths and there aren’t really any big areas without cliffs blocking your path and forcing you in a certain direction. One is you can’t check your legs for injuries. The backpack management isn’t how I thought and they had to get rid of some of the buildings you can craft. And again, I don’t know about you, but one of the biggest things I was and still am looking forward to is building a cool base. But when you start the game you can only craft three buildings, and i’m already like four hours into the campaign and can’t craft anymore buildings. I really hope that you can find more recipes for buildings otherwise that would sort of ruin my experience. 

Overall though, the game is incredibly fun and difficult. I hope that we will have some new updates, maybe adding mud building and iron, and I would say this is a must buy if you are into survival games. This is a lot better than Song in the Smoke. Thanks for reading this far if you made it, I know it was a long review, but I felt like since I have been waiting for so long it deserves all my thoughts.",Apr 12 at 2:05 AM,4, 181,"Hi! Thank you for your detailed review - it's awesome and truly appreciated! We are now working on improving the game's every aspect, so the experience is the best one can get on the Quest hardware and will only go further up. Stay tuned for a patch and - last but not least - there will be co-op added to the game as well as new content to explore in the Amazonian jungle :) Happy exploring!"
2022-05-27 21:41:10.314769,VRReviews,THE BEST Quest 2 Survival Game! 🌟,"Check out my review in full here: https://youtu.be/3BecMVoDOk4

Or just search for my channel 'VR REVIEWS' 

This is my impression after playing now for about 5 hours (the game is said to be approx. 10-15 hours long).

The graphics are simply brilliant for a Quest 2 title, especially being an open world game. And it’s not just the graphics, but the physics too, you can cut, break and make a lot of different things. It all makes for a pretty immersive experience. 

Another thing I absolutely loved about the game was how hands on it was. There’s not much button mashing to be had here. If you get wounded, you have to use the motion controller to wrap the bandage. If there’s a leech on you, you’re pulling that sucker off using your motion controller. Everything from crafting and combat to eating and swimming is super interactive and makes great use of VR.

Then there’s the gameplay mechanics, for example, the night/day cycle, weather conditions, and all the different survival elements like keeping your macronutrients up, keeping hydrated, getting rest, avoiding getting poisoned, healing yourself and so on. These mechanics along with the engaging story draws you in and you really do feel like you’re struggling to survive. On my first few runs, I was just bumbling through the jungle, falling off logs, picking up poisonous frogs and ultimately, doing a sh*t job at surviving which, to be fair, probably reflects how I would go in real life. 

In terms of negatives, there’s not a whole lot to report. There are still some bugs to iron out and some graphical elements don’t match the quality of others. There’s also an annoying thing where if the main character Jake is running low on something like water, he will tell you every minute which is really irritating.

Other than that, from what I played, Green Hell VR is shaping up to be one of my most favourite Quest 2 games!",Apr 8 at 4:59 AM,5, 183,
2022-05-27 21:41:12.366687,GrumpyDuckVR,Green Hell Survival is AWESOME,"I dont write many reviews but having spent a couple hours in the survival mode I absolutely love this game. Although I can't comment on the main story, if your after a decent crafting, survival game on the quest 2 I would recommend this one! Can't wait for the multiplayer to be out

2022-05-27 21:41:14.407211,Haelius,"Great, just one suggestion","The grame looks absolutely great for a quest port. I think it uses application spacewarp to pull this off, which means that I would put the graphics somewhere between PCVr and what you would expect from a quest game (I think it is definitly a step up, especially with so dense vegetation and so many stuff around)

The VR interactions in this game work very well, and the devs build on the strengths of the VR platform. 

I have one minor suggestion to the devs: When you put items in the waist slots, it would be nice to get an audio and/or haptic clue to confirm the item was placed in the socket. Since there is no clue now, it is easy to drop an item accidentlly that you intended to put in the waist slots.

UPDATE:

Encountered some bugs:
- Setting game mode to sitting and then quitting the game puts me below floor level in the quest menu, which persists even after a headset restart
- After a while crafting didn't work anymore, nothinf happened on trigger press, had to restart the game to make it work again
- When I tried to combine a leaf bandage with a tobacco leaf, both items disappeared and my left controller was stuck vibrating, had to reload the last save to make the haptic feedback disappear
- Coconut bowls placed under water filters/collectors disappear when the game is saved and loaded

UPDATE:

Thanks for the dev response :) Yeah I mentioned some bugs not to complain, but to help make the game better. Any new game will have some bugs, I am glad if I can help fix some. No bugs I've encountered are game-breaking by any means.",Apr 21 at 11:10 PM,5, 77,"Hi! Thank you for your thorough feedback, we appreciate it and the technical team will be informfed about the issues you've encountered. And yes, we used spacewarp to make the dense jungle work nearly flawleslly on the Quest headset. As we've mentioned numerous times, Green Hell VR is not a simple port but a game built ground-up for VR and with VR players in mind from the start. Also thanks for the update with the bugs - we will be looking through them to add on our list for future patches :) Best wishes from the dev team!"
2022-05-27 21:41:18.642046,Purplemikey,Green hell - prettiest hell!,"Visual are stunning, using latest technology from Meta, the studio managed to pull a gem with crazy good visuals not matched by any game I've seen before (on meta quest 2 - april 7th).

The story is very good, lots to cover, deep story with multiple emotions along it. There are clear goals to reach.

The game is unforgiving (but there are various difficulty levels) and won't hold your hand. I suggest starting with story to learn the basics and use youtube if you need help. There's a wiki and a bunch of tutorials. But on lower difficulty mode you'll do just fine no matter your skill levels.

I strongly recommend checking it out!",Apr 8 at 5:52 AM,5, 94,
2022-05-27 21:41:20.708933,Bennet84,Green Hell is back better than ever,"I have over 3000 hours in green hell flat on pc and I can say quest edition is going to be the best survival game and for sure one of the top 5 best game on Quest 2.

Touching story mode, challenging survival mode, nice graphics for a standalone device, immersive as few vr games so far.

If you love the genre, this will go on top of your favorite games and will get better and better with further updates.

2022-05-27 21:41:22.761842,johnny_vanderkolk_69,This is a great game that you should buy,"1. The graphics are amazing especially for quest 2 and even more so when you realize this game has an open world

2. The game has collision physics kind of like blade and sorcery due to the collision physics it adds a lot of immersion let's just say not being able to put your hand through a wall is a pretty good thing

3. Another thing I love about the game is the crafting and collecting
 Hypothetically if you were making an axe you would need to tie rope around a stone which is connected to a stick 
For the collecting you have a backpack on your back which can carry essentially anything I've only played a limited amount of this game but already there is a wide variety of animals for you to kill and collect there's also bananas and probably other fruits and vegetables to 

4. One of the complaints I've seen a lot of people talking about is the lack of co-op however I do believe they are planning to add this in a future update when exactly idk 

5. The Controls seem pretty intuitive but the menu is not as much when I play earlier today there was an issue where I could not change any setting, whenever you change a setting you need to confirm by pressing save for some reason I could not click save 


Overall I think this game is spectacular and I would recommend it to everybody personally I think this is an Oculus must have",Apr 8 at 5:56 AM,5, 49,

There's a story so you have more to do

The game looks fantastic 

The game runs very good

There's 3 Difficulties to choose from peaceful with no hostile creatures/people

Normal hostile creatures/people spawn

Hardcore hostile creatures/people do more damage

Grabbing items might feel a bit odd but you get used to it

2022-05-27 21:41:37.298742,NunuTundra,Lacking,"I don't suggest this game because it's not green hell. The crafting is so limited that it feels like crafting isn't an objective, you just make an axe, use it until it breaks then make another. There is no progression with your gear, you can't even craft armor or anything cool which is what made green hell fun. I understand the game is on stand alone quest meaning it has to be smaller, but to be the same price and have such a drastic negative difference, it's stupid and feels rushed. When this game updates it's crafting system I will rate 5 stars, but until then I suggest u only get this game on pc not on quest",Apr 9 at 3:08 PM,1, 75,"Thank you very much for your feedback!

So smart—the way you have to learn about which plants to use and avoid. Hunting, planning, having weather or nightfall affect your plans… having to think on your feet.

I worked all “day” to make sure I had supplies to light a fire, and diverse food to cook and eat. I went to light the fire and as I’m building it, I hear thunder. Oh no! ‘I need to find an over hang—better find one before dark. WAIT, I need water badly, no fire to boil it—what can I do! Drink some coconut water quickly and break it open and ate the flesh… what if I turn the bowls over to collect water! It works! Clean water for me now and to put into my flask (can’t remember what it’s called) wow thinking on your feet. Wait, can I hold my hands together to collect rainwater—yep! They though of everything.

Do you take pleasure in the pain and suffering of yourself and or others?  Are you the type of person that eats something first and asks what is it second?  This is the game for you!  I could regurgitate everything you’ve heard already about graphics and render distance and sound quality and physics and it’s all great and true but reviewer’s naming this GOTY need to hold up a sec, we are barely 1/3 through 2022… one thing I did notice was the absence of legs.  In the PCVR preview I believe you can check your calves for leeches and as far as I can tell you are limited to checking your arms for cuts/scrapes and leeches in the Quest edition…. Nevertheless if the idea of plucking parasites from your flesh (while you weigh wether or not it’s worth going just a little insane for the convenience of a quick snack) appeals to you… well look no further.",Apr 9 at 2:27 PM,5, 27,

But the survival mode is boring as is. There is no incentive to survive. It would be awesome if you could repair a plane or hot air balloon to escape the jungle. Maybe a crashed plane at the airfield? Parts could be randomly scattered around the map. Maybe the repair requires a certain type of bone or plant-made adhesive. The part locations and required ingredients could be randomized elements to boost replay-ability.",12 hours ago,5, 3,

This game is INSANE. 
Realistic. Scary. Very natural and clever tutorial. Easy mechanics. Lots of options to make it comfortable (as it can be) for you. 

I loved Ark and Conan Exiles. This is right up my alley. It is really scary in VR. I honestly had to take a break my adrenaline was pumping so high. I can’t wait to jump back in.

——————————————————————

Now, for the Actual Review

First impression was AMAZING. Great graphics for Quest, the optimization is the best on the Oculus Quest Platform so far. 

Gameplay is awesome. A bit Choppy of course, but with another Update after more reviews it’ll be amazing. Very realistic movement & survival tactics. 

The major glitch right now is the Jumping. It’s VERY easy to get stuck on a fallen tree/obstacles etc)  But when you try to jump over the logs or small rocks you get stuck and it depletes the crap out of your stamina. 

It’ll drain your stamina like you actually jumped but you really didn’t. Once that gets fixed. I will MOST DEFINITELY changing my review to 5 full stars. 

Even with that small glitch I still played until my headset died and loved every minute of it. But other than that GAME ON it’s a great game. Definitely worth the buy & I’m glad I preordered.

UPDATED 04/26/22

New Update & Patch is here. All the movement I complained about is GONE. Features are easier to use and I’m not having any movement issues (like getting stuck on Rocks/Uneven ground. All that has been fixed. 

Moving my Feedback from 4 Stars to 5 Stars. I knew the team would be quick with a Update. Great game!!",Apr 27 at 7:57 PM,5, 8,"Thanks a lot for revisiting your review, it really means a lot for us that you got to appreciate our hard work on the game <3 Stay tuned for more in the future as we ain't stopping any time soon with the patches :)"
2022-05-27 21:41:51.734042,djb.rob94,The game you've been waiting for.,"I loved Saints and Sinners, for at it's core it was a gather, craft and survive game. No eating and drinking wasn't mandatory, and sleep was used to progress days. But it was an amazing experience. 

Green hell takes that gather, craft and surive mechanic to a whole new level. Every aspect of your character (you) is constantly under attack, from dehydration, hunger, insects, animals, exhaustion, plant life and more. Surviving means making every second perfect, learning how to utilize everything around you from sticks, stones, plants, animals and more. 

Crafting is in depth, as it requires that you use a real to life approach, forcing a stick into the ground to build the foundation of your shelter, wrapping rope around a stick to make a torch, running a stick through a fish to cook it over a fire, striking two stones together to start the fire. Incredible.

On my first night, after finishing cooking my fish, I sat on the floor inside of my shelter, looking out with a bone knife in hand, jumping at every little sound and faint movement in the Forest beyond, listening to the fire crackle next to me.

Make no mistake, it's H A R D unless you learn to use all the resources made available to you. You might not know that you need coconuts to stay hydrated early game. You might not be aware that you can't just eat fish, you need fats and carbs as well, attained from fruit and nuts. I have to recommend learning the basics before jumping into this, as to not overwhelm yourself.

For $30, you're missing out if you don't buy it. Yeah it's a little buggy right now, but, in my opinion, I'm honestly baffled as to how the Quest 2 can handle this title. You'll be blown away, and play for hours without realizing it. 


Do it. Buy the game.",Apr 8 at 11:30 AM,5, 17,"Thank you for recommending our game and for the detailed review.

2022-05-27 21:42:02.048297,TealVince,Most fun I've had on Oculus,"The game is remarkably immersive and the world feels really large for a quest game.  It does have a bit of a learning curve, however it gets much easier once you get the hang of how to best juggle your resources.  

While parts can seem challenging, at no point did I find it completely unfair after discovering what I was doing wrong.

I did encounter a few occasional bugs (stuck/missing arms, laggy frame rate, disappearing discus fish) and I wasn't fond of the ending, but I still found the game to be one of the best native experiences I've tried on the Quest.

Also, to the devs: my first pass thru I managed to take a path that went around the location of the last map.  I found the final destination myself ending the game unexpectedly.  It might be worthwhile adding a critical item at the map location (or moving the one from the cave there) to ensure being able to win the game.",Apr 26 at 1:09 PM,5, 6,

Will Change to 5/5 If I could Hide the Persistent HP/Stamina Bar for better Immersion.  Persistent Elements like this are distracting and the way it follows my screen movements is a bit nauseating .

1. Joystick drift needs to be addressed and fixed.(no it’s not the controller, it is 100% the games issue). I’ve died too many times due to drift, falling off logs. and trying to add wood to a fire or simply hit a tree and then gliding 6 feet away is beyond annoying. 

2. Isn’t a glitch by any means. But the “Health & Energy bar” could have an option to go away. To give complete immersion. It’s already on the watch. The hud is unnecessary and it following my head movement is a nuisance. 

Few bugs here and there such as sometimes crafting doesn’t work. A quick game restart fixes it. 
When you grab your spear the character grabs it in an unusable way(out of backpack, right shoulders) and you need to toy with the spear to get it comfortable. which makes it hard to be a quick killer when necessary. 
Still within early Development but we live in an era where “early release” is a money grab and the game goes unfixed. This game has amazing potential. I’ll change my rating after a few updates on the things stated, upon other things others have mentioned.",Apr 10 at 9:28 AM,3, 20,"Hello, and thank you for your review.

It wouldn't be so bad but the status bars are visible on the watch and the text in the notebook you carry, so they are completely superfluous anyway.

Graphics are good, but for me it lacks the captivating factor. I got bored with it after trying it for around 3 hours. There wasn't much that pulls you into playing for another 5 minutes, then another 5 minutes ......

Good survival game if thats your thing, if you're uncertain if survival games are your thing then do some research first and wait till it goes on sale.

UPDATED REVIEW

Ok so I'm happy to admit my first thoughts were written too soon after trying green hell.

As above I initially got bored with the game. However due to the cost I thought I'd persist. Glad I did....

Haven't tried survival mode yet as I'm still in story mode which I recommend for any new player first up.
Follow the instructions in your book. Initially I couldn't be bothered making the special brew to restore my memory an d I spent most my time with only a axe trying to light fires and feed myself. The game is wayyyy more than that. So again, follow the instructions in your book and even if you die a few times spend the time working out how to craft spears, arrows, bows etc. Once you realise you can do that ( and look up youtube to find the first grapling hook)  the game gets better and better the deeper you go.
I can now say I've spent hours and hours on this and I'm immersed.

I'm not one to care greatly about the story. I'm more of a progress guy and I think that was my initial downfall. I felt the book was part of the story so didn't pay it enough attention. But by reading as I progressed i finally realised I can make this and that by doing xyz and that my next goal was to do abc. Much better than thinking the game was just about feeding myself and lighting a fire.

For the devs.... my suggestions.... the portions of food required seem to be a little un natural. In the real world not too many people I know of would need to eat 4 fish 1 crab and 2 steaks  to feel full by then its time to sleep, then your hungry again and so it repeats, perhaps tweak that a little ? :)",Apr 25 at 12:37 PM,4, 7,

1. Always have cooked meat in your pack.  You’ll never know when you might desperately need protein. 

2. Always have coconuts in your pack too.  They give a good amount of fats and water. 

3. Use a spear to kill things.  It’s much easier to not get bit by things like snakes and spiders if you use a spear.  

4. Always be eating fruits and nuts n such.  Be careful though not all fruits and nuts help you. 

5. Keep a good amount of tobacco plants on you in case you get stung or bit by something venomous. 

6.  Also keep the lily flowers on you at all times.  They help immensely with getting rid of nausea.  

7. KEEP YOUR SOUND WAY UP!  Spiders, scorpions, snakes, big cats, and even tribes people make sounds when near you so keep your ears and eyes peeled.  

8. You can wrap most tools with rope to make it stronger. 

9. You can save your game in a hut shelter!  No need to go back to the very beginning of the game every-time you die.

Developed by a separate team and providing a different more linear experience to the PC version, I’m pleased with what I’ve played so far. 

To hear my full thoughts and experience with the Quest version of Green Hell please search ‘GAMERTAG VR GREEN HELL QUEST’",Apr 8 at 6:12 AM,4, 18,"Thanks Gamertag for the amazing review - we really appreciate your feedback and we will continue working on polishing out some rough edges here and there in our game. We will be expanding the linear experience to make it less noticeable for sure, so stay tuned for any new patches :D"
2022-05-27 21:42:45.647729,FutureShock_,One of the deepest games on the platform,"Of the big Quest 2 singleplayer titles, most tend to play it safe and aim for the widest possible audience which means sacrificing depth and challenging gameplay. 
This is not true for Green Hell. 

I haven't played the flatscreen version but compared to other survival titles I've played, this one seems to hold its own pretty well without oversimplifying its mechanics for a wider audience. As a result, it will be too hardcore for some people, which is great because VR needs games that challenge the player and respect their intelligence rather than hold their hand. 

Green Hell on the Quest plays like a serious PC title, not like the overly accessible VR ""experiences"" large developers are constantly churning out. 

A note about the graphics:

Visually this game pushes a lot of boundaries as it's the first full game to use Application Spacewarp, a technology developed by Meta to render half or a third the frames of the headset's refresh rate and interpolate the in between frames with artificial ones generated based on the motion vector data from the graphics engine (it is NOT the same tech as Async Spacewarp on PC -- it's far more accurate). 

Using this tech enabled the developers to really push the graphical capabilities of the headset which is how the game is able to pull off late PS3-level graphics. The game isn't the prettiest Quest title with its muddy textures and aliasing, but it's the most visually complex thanks to all the foliage and physics interactions. These features add necessary depth to the gameplay, and without ASW, Green Hell would be a much shallower game. 

The downside to this tech is that the developers had to leave it on 100% of the time (due to the setting). This unfortunately leads to persistent jittering and minor artifacting that makes the game not feel entirely smooth. I'm not knocking any points off my review as I believe it was a choice between ASW, a worse game or no Quest port at all. There is some room for optimization, however.",Apr 12 at 4:42 AM,5, 9,"Wow, thanks a lot for your detailed review! Yes, we incorporated the Spacewarp from Meta into our game. This fantastic technology allowed us to cross some hardware limitations and deliver the game we wanted to deliver :) Design-wise, the game was meant to be challenging, yet still, there are different difficulty levels so all players can experience the wonders of the amazonian jungle :)"

The game is a Survial game based in the Amazon and it features very impressive graphics, rendering distance, sounds and gameplay.",Apr 8 at 2:32 AM,4, 25,"Hello! Thank you for the rating and the entertaining video. We appreciate it a lot, as we've worked hard on the graphics in the game! Cheers :)"
2022-05-27 21:42:58.072935,internallydeluded,Game breaking bug,"Had to drop my four star rating. The vial of blood you need for the good ending disappears out of the machine leaving you unable to finish the game. I’ve seen several other complaints on Reddit about this so I know it isn’t me. The same thing happens with the water collectors and filters. The bowls you put into them disappear making them useless. 

Now if I want to get the good ending of the game I have to start all over again unless this somehow gets fixed. It’s a shame because this had been one of my favorite quest games. I will leave my original 4-star review below, but until the issue is fixed I can’t recommend playing this. 

Really enjoying the game and I think anyone who wants something more involved than all of the rhythm, mini game and wave shooters on quest should enjoy this, especially if you like survival games.  The crafting makes great use of immersive actions. And what it takes to keep yourself healthy and alive is very engrossing.  

Here’s the complaints since I don’t know where else to report them. 

You can’t throw spears. They either fall right in front of you or go flying into the distance and disappear. If a jaguar is somewhere you need to go you basically have to camp out for a day and wait until it leaves. There’s typically no way around it and scoring a head shot with the bow and arrow would be very difficult and with a spear it would be impossible. 

The bamboo water collector and water filter are bugged. The bowls put into them disappear at some point when you move away from them. So getting enough water to survive is going to be tough at some point.  

The grappling hook is tricky to use. But the real problem is if it lands on a cliff or tree on its way back down then it’s gone and you have to reload your last save. 

Thats all I’ve got for now. Despite all of this the game is still really good compared to most quest games. Get it.",19 days ago,1, 8,"Hi there!

Exploring the jungle is cool, the graphics are good, and the story is right up my alley. If you are considering buying this game, wait if you can!  There are way too many bugs at this point. It's hard enough surviving without the game's bugs working against you. Right off the bat getting a cursor to appear to ok the game's controls before the game even loads is problematic. Items necessary for survival disappear form your backpack constantly. Yet my bag's weight keeps increasing beyond its capacity as i use and lose items.  Picking up items is a pain, especially when other items are nearby. Palm leaves are especially hard to pick up. Being anywhere near your shelter brings up the save menu. So when trying to walk away, you will literally freeze every step, have to drop items from your hands and either save or go back to the game.  This can happen like 5 times and is really frustrating.  You should just have to pull the trigeer to save.  Then everything was going well and it started to rain.  This giant baby of a character then went insane. I wasnt near a cave to make a fire and if i ventured out i was killed by an imaginary tribesman within 2 minutes.  If i tried to sleep to wait it out i somehow died by bleeding. It's messed up that if it happens to rain it's game over.  I had to start over on an easier mode so the sanity could be turned off but many other options I would have like to keep on are turned off as well.  There was no customization option.  The day goes by too fast and your health depletes quickly.  Lastly, a capybara is not a tapir as labelled in the game.

2022-05-27 21:43:10.563921,Masen Boucher,Ok a honest but critical review,Ok so the game was not bad to start just needs alot of work and tlc the game feels kinda rushed some of the trees were missing texture and the animals kinda are boring for example a snake will just stay in a coil while your throwing a rock at it.not to say it was all bad the crafting and healing was enjoyable and I wish other games had similar crafting to this one like Walking dead saints and sinners if I had to craft a bow or tie rope around my blade it would make it alot more fun emersive and I would want to see more things I could craft. Another thing that is kinda annoying is when the character is thirsty he will say the same 2 lines over and over and over again very frequently   another thing is the map its small i keep running into the same spot and it all looks the same on the map again the map is kinda bland and I don't feel like I'm in a dangerous jungle I feel like I'm playing in my backyard in my opinion it was not worth $30 (right now) if they fix some things like the animal behavior it would be 5 star and alot more interesting and not so easy I would recommend if your looking for a survival fix go to walking dead saints and sinners until this one improves a bit.im updating my rating from here first off I think this game could go super far. The dev team feels devoted to me and I appreciate that in games...but I have sum ideas that could improve the game say for the spider you could make it jump and have some be on trees same with sum of the poison frogs another thing I thought would improve my and many others experience add more bugs and similar things because picking off leaches and having to look for similar things was really good and fun for me thank for the devs for getting back too me,Apr 14 at 2:33 AM,3, 12,"Hi and thank you for your honesty, we really appreciate it.

2022-05-27 21:43:18.837924,Harp,PRETTY COOL TO SEE ON QUEST 2,"its impressive to see this running on the quest 2 granted how limited graphically it is, but the game (for the limitations) is beautiful. the controls are actually pretty good and the game felt good to get into. im sure theres polishing to do as it just came out, but overall its a solid title

(i love the details and the physics of leaves,water,ect and i love how indepth certain systems are, like drinking unclean water can give you a parasite among many other things that can happen) 
its rly cool to see the detail ingame but with detail can come confusion 

as of right now i dont have many complaints, the game could use more instructions but i was able to figure things out, i had saw one review where the person had no clue what to do, the performance is pretty good for all the physics it includes, i like the idea that you can destroy most things around you, and i like how you actually assemble tools and buildables. 

three complaints i would have is
-when i crouch down irl my shoulders in game are positioned in a weird way above where my irl head is .(but the hands are in the place they are supposed to be)

-the character model can feel a little large so maybe some customization on sizing the hands and wrists (it isnt rly noticeable tho with the current model)

-and the physics when swinging tools feel a bit akward, they arent terrible, i kindof like the way it handles but at times it can feel a little weird

also some of the 1/2 star reviews are a little dumb, they said later on they will add multiplayer, and it did just release so performance eventually is sure to improve along with other aspects. not to be rude, but it is good to research this stuff before buying something like a game, if you know that before hand you will know what to expect (again i do not mean to be rude but it could avoid dissapointment for future games 👍)

i was on edge about getting this cause the price but i was satisfied with it

overall its a solid 4.5/5 vr game and definitely cool to have a building survival game on the quest two and i hope the game improves overtime, i also liked the ability to customize your experience if you want a laid back experience, definitely amazing work so congrats to the team that made the game",Apr 8 at 9:56 AM,4, 11,"Thanks for the extensive and exhaustive feedback, we really appreciate those as it helps us improve many aspects of the game based on the players' feedback alone. We will be continously polishing the game with fixes and patches, so stay tuned for any announcements from us. We really pushed the limitations of Quest 2 to its limits, so we will see what can be done further :D The customization option seems like a nice idea, we will talk internally about a possible design of it and maybe implement it! Thanks for understand our point of view and giving us a chance! Happy exploring :)"
2022-05-27 21:43:23.028759,Luke_Hague,Best survival game I've played in myLIFE,"This game is a one of a kind. I'm not one to spend buckets of time in vr, but for a 20h campaign grinded in a week, I can say it was worth it. This game had me on my toes and it was so thrilling. All I can suggest for people who haven't played through the story is to READ ALL THE SMALL THINGS! I skimmed through alot of the reading material, and I seriously regret. This games story and plot are so incredibly written that every word should be savored. Not only does this game feel amazing and open, it also has an even better story line. And for this, I truly look forward to any future games from this/these creators.
Cheers! And well done.",8 days ago,5, 1,"Thanks a lot for the review, we appreciate your review <3 We tried really hard to bring the best survival experience onto Quest and it's so humbling to see the positive reception :)"
2022-05-27 21:43:25.067565,kkuzma1982,Outstanding survival!,"The graphics are almost PC level with all the little details like destructible vegetation or butterflies. There is a night and day cycle, the physics are also great. There is adventure mode with a great tutorial and survival endless mode without tutorial. The game is 10+ hours long. Next to Song in the smoke best survival on Quest 2!

As far as I know the developers plan to add even more content like new constructions and cooperative multiplayer.

To developers: please don't limit the number of items on the area as it is so good even with decreased performance. If decision is made to limit number of items please make it as an option that can be disabled or enabled.",Apr 11 at 5:32 PM,5, 6,"Thanks for your awesome feedback! I've passed your opinion about items to the dev team, they'll look into it. Happy hunting!"
2022-05-27 21:43:27.146355,proud2,Great game definitely worth it but…,"I have spent days and hours playing this game, love the story line but can’t seem to finish it due to all the crocodiles!! First I hate crocodiles they scare the living hell outta me especially coming out of nowhere I know I’m a baby 😂 but I kept pushing through my fear but The one at the research camp keeps respawning so I hurried up to pass just to get to the last drink to make and I get attacked again by another one! They are a pain! I think I have seen more crocs at the end then I have seen cats running around. I would love to finish it but think I think I’m going to have to just put it down and not finish the story. Overall other then the crocs this game is amazing. Warning though if you have a phobia of snakes, crocs, spiders, or anything in the jungle this game is so realistic it’s crazy and may not be for you unless they come out with something to take out what you fear. Other then that this game is the best survival game I have ever played.",22 days ago,4, 3,"Hi there! Thanks for your review - we understand that crocodiles can be a little bit frustrating to deal with. We aim for the most realistic game ever, however, we don't want to pay the price for the fun factor at all.

2022-05-27 21:43:29.191431,Blaisz,GOOD GAME NEEDS UPDATE,This game is great very fun and challenging game but there is some improvement. I think the developers should add some more structures and crafts you should be able to make your own shelter by hitting sticks into the ground or into walls but other wise a great game.,2 days ago,5, 1,
2022-05-27 21:43:31.273641,Ghost14121,Fun game overall but could add to it,"So yeah the game is really good I am having a blast playing it but it would be so much better if there was a multiplayer mode, the graphics were just a little bit better but for a VR game they are good. Multiplayer mode would be very fun cause you would get to play with your friends build a shelter with them and just have some fun, the game would be really good if there was like a mode where there were not as many restrictions and it would kinda be like you could travel a lot of anywhere on the map kinda like RDR2 I would have a blast playing on a map like that.",8 days ago,5, 0,"Thanks for the review!

But.. :(,"Okay this game is the best survival game on Oculus Quest but I have one problem, after the new update my game will not install, its been 4 weeks and its still installing, I am waiting for BoneLabs to come out but I can't play it if this keeps installing, if you can't fix this I can ask MetaQuest but other than that please help.",Apr 27 at 11:19 PM,4, 5,"Thanks a lot for your review! This is weird... have you tried contacting Meta Support or tried resetting your headset? We haven't had any issue, but we hope you can resolve your problem and enjoy jungle in VR :)"
2022-05-27 21:43:37.544054,AliceM4lyce,Horrible gameplay,"I do not understand how this game has such a high rating. It is SO buggy. The collision is ridiculous. Want to hack a plant? Make sure to hit it at least a foot to the side. Your wrists are jello. Your first range weapon is a spear but LOL good luck trying to throw it with your jello wrists. The weapons at your side are actually slightly in front of you, so half the time when you want to pick up something from the ground, youll pick up your weapons...The story is great and I would love the game if a little more time had been spent on refining the mechanics...

Edit for dev: jello wrists, not hands. Also, hold a coconut bowl and put a snail in it. Apparently snails are 19847382 kg lol.",Apr 28 at 12:44 AM,2, 5,

One thing I don't think is very clear is using both triggers to craft certain tools carries over to making other tools as well. Spent a good hour trying to make a spear.
Thank you for making this for vr it adds alot of great features.",Apr 9 at 12:22 AM,5, 6,"Hello, thank you for your feedback and review. I let the technical team know about the issues you've mentioned. Also, rest assured, we are working on adding co-op mode, so - stay tuned!"

2022-05-27 21:43:47.873684,saltyboi_,This game is great but I’m having a prob,So when I was at the part of the game when he tells Mia he just killed the Tribe members I killed them and made a save there keep in mind I have another save but way earlier in the game so I save my game then I die because I fell and whenever I go back to that save I get killed instantly by the tribe members if anyone knows how to fix this please tell me,4 days ago,4, 1,

2022-05-27 21:43:51.957561,killersmith03,Great game,The game is very fun the best survival games on quest by far. You can tell they put a lot of time into this but I have noticed a few things like animals like snakes spawning in very specific locations every time u start a new game and every time u just go by a area you’ve been I walked by the same snake I killed 3 times in like 15 minutes and it was kinda anoying but I can overlook that due to how great the game is can’t wait for multiplayer,6 days ago,4, 1,
2022-05-27 21:43:53.999854,nosforactu,so good,one of the best quest games you can get. it’s a different experience encountering a jaguar for the first time. the only thing is the mechanics of the bow and arrow is kinda wack as soon as u pull it to ur cheek it’ll glitch out and aim somewhere else,7 days ago,5, 0,Thanks a lot for your review!

This game will kill you. 

Then you get the hang of it. Shoot parrots out of the sky to make more arrows. Spear fish. Drink Ayahuasca till you hallucinate your coconuts off. 

I was scared often, laughed much, felt like a hero, and spent many a moment just staring at the stunningly beautiful realism that they built. 

Easily one of the best VR games ever made.",Apr 25 at 9:23 PM,5, 2,This is a perfect summary for the game haha Thank you so much for making us laugh :D
2022-05-27 21:44:02.318411,V-Jolean,A rewarding adventure for the brave,"I've had this game for a few days now and I'm still hooked. The gameplay, while initially frustrating and opaque, quickly transformed into an addictive loop of surviving, moving into unexplored areas, watching out for predators, and hunting. While dying may seem initially off-putting, each death teaches you some more gameplay mechanics. One thing I wish I knew going into this game was how to make soup. Looking forward to more content, and multiplayer hopefully sooner than later!!",Apr 26 at 1:32 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-27 21:44:04.369235,doggoisgood,Good game and has a bit of horror,"I love this game and even the leaches but really leaches aren’t a problem but when I go and grab a stick and kill a fish the dead fish is invisible and I can’t eat meat unless I go and find a another animal speaking of animals they go into the wall they just run into a wall and go though it so it’s tricky to get meat 

Though this game is so realistic and cool I would recommend people that are not scared of spiders and leaches and it feels like there on me!",17 days ago,5, 0,Thanks for your review! This game is not a walk in the park for sure unless you are playing in the Tourist mode :)
2022-05-27 21:44:06.432416,TravisHell,Waste of Money,"Graphics are decent , not exceptional.  Less about survival and more about how much food and water can you take in before succumbing to the extremely slow paced game.  Hard to enjoy the other things the game might offer when the majority of the time your eating and drinking to satisfy the annoying audio reminders that your hungry and thirsty.  15 bananas , 8 coconuts and endless supplies of boiled water won’t keep you from starving or dying of thirst  shortly after consuming it all. Real people have survived harsher conditions with a lot less than this game requires.  Save your money.",May 1 at 7:38 AM,1, 3,"Thanks for your honest feedback about the game, we really appreciate even the harshest critique. We've already fixed the annoying audio reminders as well as many other issues, so you can give the game another try if you have some free time :) We will continue to work on the game and update it with frequent patches."
2022-05-27 21:44:08.499335,TruFoox,"At the moment, it is unplayable","I'm not prone to motion sickness, but goddamn this game almost made me puke. There is this really nauseating ghosting effect that happens when you turn, and it's ability to sense my stance (bent over, standing, crouching) is really wonky. I can't even sit down and rest because the ""Sitting"" mode is broken during normal gameplay. Instead of making my height normal (as if I am standing up), it sets my height to be the same as the height of headset while I am sitting, essentially rendering the ""Sitting"" mode useless. However, it seems to work just fine while I am in the main menu, so I am unsure as to why this is.
I was really excited to be able to play a survival-themed game on my Meta (or whatever the hell they want me to call it) Quest, but this is a letdown.

Edit: The dev response was terrible. Don't disregard issues your users are facing. That isn't a good look. First of all, I know how spacewarp works; my specific issue is not normal with spacewarp. Second of all, don't tell me that my issue with sitting/standing doesn't exist. You literally said that ""everything works fine"" while I'm telling you that it isn't. I'm not expecting you to grovel at my feet and beg for forgiveness, but I expect you to consider the fact that my issue may be a real bug with your game. For that terrible response alone, I'm bumping my review down by one star.

Edit 2: Crafting doesn't work at all. This game now has nothing going for it. I can't even play the game because the devs aren't properly debugging before they release it. 1 star.",Apr 12 at 6:26 AM,1, 37,"Hello and thank you for your comment. In case of motion sickness, we are using a new technology called Asynchronous Spacewarp - few players can experience motion sickness because of that. From our observations we can say that you might get used to it rather quickly. We hope you will give it another try, and please remember to take a break between gaming sessions. To the Sitting mode issues - everthing should works fine. To tackle your problem, please check if your Guardian is set properly (floor level is crucial here). If yes, boot up the game, check if your position setting (sitting or standing) is set correctly and then hold your oculus button located on right controller. We hope that will help and you'll give our game another try."
2022-05-27 21:44:12.709338,Chlasma,Love it!!,"Graphics are awesome, on the very high end. However a bug causes me sometimes beeing unable to craft anything which can be SUPER annoying. Especially after travelling for a while and having to restart then. 
Otherwise an awesome game, will get 5 after this bug is fixed.

Edit: Fixed now. There is one more thing- waking up abd 2 more natives (which had been killed already) instantly killing you forced me to reload a 3h younger save fil :((((
However, this is the BEST vr game of 2022 so far, just arrived at the ""bad"" ending. 
Thanks for giving movement to the environment, this game looks so freaking gorgeous!!!!!!!!
Awesome work, hope it pays out for you guys",Apr 24 at 10:16 PM,5, 2,"Thank you for your review and feedback! We will, of course, continue to be working on the game and be updating it with patches, so stay tuned!"
2022-05-27 21:44:14.758290,booknerdgrl,I Can't Recommend This Game Enough,"So far, I think this is the most awesome game I've played on the Q2. I'm not that far into it, and I'm playing story mode- tourist right now... but this game is SO AMAZING!!! Since I purchased it, I live and breathe this game, it's so addictive! If you want a spectacular adventure you HAVE to get this game. First thing you need to learn is to make your shelter, that's how you save your game progress. I didn't know that at first, so I'd have to start over at the beginning every time I played. You will not be disappointed with this game.

***************************************

UPDATE: 4/24/22
Issues I've noticed since purchasing the game:
 
Mine seems to be very buggy. 

++  My 2nd map randomly disappeared and I can't seem to get it back. Returning to the location I acquired it from does nothing, because I already got it.. so the game won't give me another one. 

++ There is no climbing gear. I have the grappling hook, but the climbing gear does not exist in my game regardless of what level I'm playing in. 


++ Improvements Needed: ++ 

+ Making the arrows easier to access, along with the bow. Having to rummage through the backpack every time you need an arrow is frustrating. Not to mention, it makes hunting difficult because the animal runs off from all the noise you're making while going through your bag. It's not a deal breaker, but it would make things a little smoother.",Apr 25 at 11:04 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-27 21:44:16.807027,AVENGEDxANGEL,I bought this game on every system I own,"I like it so much so I had to get the VR experience also. 

It can be hard, you are going to run out of food and he’s always hungry which makes it fun and challenging to survive. 

You are gonna get those blood sucking leeches you have to pull off

And when you eat you will get amebas sometimes . Just eat the orange mushrooms found on trees to get rid of them 

Try to build a hut after long walks and save as often as you can because it sucks when your headset dies and you have to treck all that way back! 

The story is good on this game! 
You wont regret buying it! It is a lot of fun! Hours and hours of entertainment. If I didn’t enjoy it so much I wouldn’t have it on Xbox and Playstation and Steam also. VR is a different experience too! It is so cool!",Apr 25 at 10:16 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-27 21:44:18.847078,EZBEE,There are a frustrating amount of bugs,"I had gotten so far on the last run when the crafting decided to just stop working, this is the third time it’s happened. The only fix is to restart and therefore loose all your progress. You get stuck if you can’t make an axe or anything because to save you must build a  hut. It’s so frustrating, it’s such a good looking and otherwise amazing and very immersive experience but there’s more bugs in the game than on the jungle floor. I’m not going to finish it till it gets fixed cause I’ll just end up screaming and I’ll probably murder Mia if I ever meet her again.",Apr 18 at 11:57 AM,3, 5,"Oh no! We are sorry you couldn't progress through the game further because of the crafting glitch! We don't want you losing any progress anymore, so in one of the future patches we will be fixing this issue altogether and hopefully for good! Thanks for the review and we are glad you got to enjoy the game, regardless of the issue :)"
2022-05-27 21:44:20.883180,JGDesigns,Future updates,"For future updates I hope to see:
+base building
+option for legs
+merging the world without loading screens
+food preservation 
+snakes and more danger
+sandbox difficulty

Base building sounds like asking for too much. I know it wouldn’t work unless it was a very light version with just small additions like basic wood walls, stairs and roofing.

An option for legs means it could tank some performance and should be an option for enabling in the settings. Immersion factor is increased. Big reason I play Blade and Sorcery Nomad often.

Merging the world also sounds like it’s a bit too much. Maybe another area added to the game where it is a bit more open/more space for when multiplayer/co-op is added and possibly base building.

A way to preserve food so it could last longer. Wrapping it in banana leaves with rope to give it triple the amount of time before it spoils would be a HUGE plus.

I think Snakes should be more dangerous and slither around from spot to spot while attacking the player. Maybe add enemies that may be missing from the original game without hurting performance or added to the new area I suggest above.

Sandbox like addition where we could choose which settings are on and off for a custom difficulty suited to our playstyles.

Edit: added more text. Quest version is still great. Can’t wait for future updates and the PC version.",Apr 17 at 11:17 AM,4, 6,Hello and thank you for your review. I passed the ideas you've mentioned to the devs. Stay tuned for updates!

I had like 10 minutes left of the story and i had to start over because i had to reinstall because of the glitch. So i am so angry at the game. Played like 10 hours before i had to reinstall.

2022-05-27 21:44:27.159047,liquidddd,I changed my rating from 2 to 4,"Not like the console game at all. First you have no legs for some reason and second the crafting is completely different. And the way you hold things is weird it likes to phase through your hand... EDIT: I get that I just don't understand why you removed the legs. I NEED LEGS WHERE ARE MY LEGS

ANOTHER EDIT: idk how no one is talking about how it's called quest edition when it's not even on the quest how is no one talking about this it's a big deal and everyone just doesn't care.

The start of it is very easy to learn how to make things and the guide is very simple, it’s just up to you to keep yourself  alive! Although this game is made very good, there is a couple things needed  to be added. One thing is just a simple splash when your sloshing around in the lakes and a splash when you drop something in it. Playing in this game there are a lot of encounters with lakes and just a simple splash in it would make a BIG difference! Another thing would be, making the hunger not go down SO fast. I could eat 8 bananas and the character would still be hunger!!! I’m sure if I’m thinking of it correctly or not, but that’s seems ridiculous! Then there’s the part where you try to pick up things and it’s to the point you have to make your character crouch to pick up certain items!!! It’s annoying!!!

I also would recommend that you play story fist tho because it teaches you same things about the game that you might not know before. The game it's self is also pretty hard and will make you mad at some times

I think that multi-player would make this game better Anda bit more popular cause i just couldn't imagine surviving with my friend in the jungle.

2022-05-27 21:44:43.761686,Ironbug78,"I found paradise, and died there.","The game plays and looks amazing, you will be in VR paradise.
Then you eat something you shouldn't have, or get a snake bite, or so many other things can go wrong. Paradise is out to get you, can you survive?

This graphically one of the best looking games on the Quest 2. The environment will submerge you in no time. From all the wild life, the great sounds and visuals, day and night cycles, weather. You will be part of the world in no time.

Its a great survival game, with many things to take care of for your health. You will be in a panic sometimes trying to find the right plant to heal you. With that said the crafting is great, and the gathering of info on the plant life for research  is amazing.

This game blew my mind that it runs on a Quest 2. This is a must feel VR experience. Best of the Best.

I had the pleasure of checking this out 2wks before release feel free to check out my video @ PSVR Asylum YouTube chan by following this link : https://youtu.be/3yQ6MOeAtjM
But to sum it up Green Hell VR does for the survival genre what T.W.D S&S did for the zombie genre.
It could use a bit more optimization and picking up items can be a bit clunky but besides that this is NEXT LEVEL VR Gaming",Apr 8 at 7:02 AM,4, 6,"Thanks so much for the support and review, we are very humbled by your response to Green Hell VR Quest Edition!

This causes the game to kind of tear together, if that makes sense. It's a way for the game to run smoothly. However, the result of this is a sickening distortion effect whenever ANYTHING happens.

2022-05-27 21:45:14.732406,Launicabelinda,Amazing immersive game!!!!!,Stepping into this game I absolutely loved it!!!! I would love to give 5 stars but I’m highly disappointed in the fact that I cannot get the 2nd Map. I’m assuming it’s a bug (based on some other complains I’ve found online) and it won’t show up at its location. I’ve tried reloading the game multiple times and I’m not sure what else to do. Besides that I love the immersive environment and the graphics. The story is interesting too. I’m hoping there is a patch to fix this issue soon so I can continue the story…,13 days ago,4, 1,Hi there! So sorry this has happened to you - we will be looking at the issue and seek to find a solution to patch soon :)
2022-05-27 21:45:16.771042,Zedisnotdead,Amazing,This game is great. I was so surprised. I also got song in the smoke some time ago but the clunky inventory system lost me after a bit......this game is so much better in everyway. Not just better than song in the smoke but also just about every other oculus game on the store....the graphics are better than saints and sinners which makes it so immersive ....I just gave one question. After I have found the elevator it seems as though I can't make fires anymore. I don't know if it's a bug or something I am doing wrong but if it's a bug I certainly want to bring it attention to the devs .....amazing game. Been playing all weekend,Apr 11 at 8:53 AM,5, 3,"Hi, thanks for your awesome feedback! We are happy that you liked Green Hell. Regarding the fire issue - if you have all the items (and since you're past the elevator, I bet you have them) it's most probably a bug. I passed your report to the dev team, guys will crack it out  asap, so please, stay tuned for updates."
2022-05-27 21:45:18.817767,OPDonut,A wonderful survival experience,"The visuals are some of the best I’ve seen on a quest game, and it runs pretty well

Some bugs I recently found just made me unable to craft anything, I just left the game and went back in and it worked again but that was weird, and after you kill frogs they still move when you pick them up in your hand, very weird, maybe it’s not a bug but I think it is

The game is extremely difficult, but it’s extremely fun, all the mechanics have been amazingly switched from flatscreen to vr, the backpack, crafting and building is all really well created, they truly used the vr platform to its advantage

Some things I wish are the ability to choose where items go in your backpack, like twdss, to have better tidiness and in the flatscreen version of the game it seemed to rain a lot more, in my hours of playing it hasn’t rained once, idk if it’s just bad luck maybe but in the flatscreen version it seemed to rain at least 1 a day for a bit

I’ve already played a few different games, those times spent dying are also time spent learning about the game, and adapting your play style

A truly immersive experience",Apr 12 at 12:38 PM,5, 3,"Hello, thank you for your awesome feedback! We are thrilled you liked it. I have passed your opinion to the dev team, the'll look into it. Happy survival and watch out for predators!"
2022-05-27 21:45:20.863747,SlickMalik,BUGS,"So many bugs, it really takes the fun for me. This feels like a early BETA version.

1. First time playing, I spawned somewhere at the end of that ""Hallway"" like map, with no coconuts AT ALL, NOWHERE. Was searching for hours, like an idiot. Had to delete the saved game.

2. I make a fire and put the coconut with water on top of the fire to boil it, than when it's cooked i take the coconut gently and it instantly extinguishes my fire.

3. Glitchy Textures

4. Respawning scorpions,spider,snakes at the same spot, after you killed them.

5. Items disappearing

6. Controllers grabing the map instead of removing leeches same the other way. Also sometimes impossible to grab leeches at all, the controller tracking is just not accurate.

7. Movement feels clunky

8. I Need to be able to climb out of rivers ect , with my hands.

In its current State i give this GAME 2 Stars for the price of 30$ for a 2,3GB Game.

I really liked the first GREEN HELL, but this is a PAIN in the A$$.

EDIT: Had to drop it to 1 STAR, since i realized, that the whole map is like a HALLWAY MAZE, not an OPEN WORLD. After 10h of playing i spent 99,9% with walking on that given path, with walls on both sides. WALKING on a given path is the objective and NOT crafting.",Apr 13 at 4:42 AM,1, 6,"Thank you for your detailed and honest feedback - it help us a lot to make our game better.

2022-05-27 21:45:22.909679,AFish InVr,"Amazing game, but one bug",I love this game. The mechanics are insane and the physics are just as good. My only problem is that when I had to drink the hallucination for the second time I drank it before got the quest and now I can’t fix it. I am stuck in one spot at the story.,Apr 19 at 10:46 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-27 21:45:27.049050,martyn.shepherd,Nearly the best game I have ever played!,"As the title suggests this is one of the best and most interactive games I have ever played and would suggest to any person wanting a strong survival experience , my first death was picking up a poison dart frog to throw at a rattle snake (fyi snakes not fased, I died of poison)
Most complaints are about lack of a tutorial...there is one if you follow the story , don't try think your a boss and dive on in on survival and complain, don't be ""that person""
The crafting is great, the fact you have to actually build the shelter, tapping the main stakes in with your axe/stone,(awsome)
Having to think ahead and keep the fire going or putting half coconuts down for rain
Dodging the snakes and spiders and big cats....I haven't seen the tribes folk yet.
I think my real tweak is the lack of crafting ...as armour is not available,  and that would be handy against the big cats, maybe I haven't found or unlocked it yet
As most say I have encountered a few bugs , and a couple of game breaker ones, eg the crafting and permanent night ones...
But I'm going to start a new game and spread some saves out , since I hear the next update will deal with these problems....
Totally worth the money, and thanks to my wife for buying it for me.",Apr 20 at 12:52 AM,4, 3,

this game is absolutely nutty.
this is the stuff you want to put on your peanut butter and jelly sandwich or this is the sauce you want to put on your burger this makes that burger a good burger.
It has a perfect amount of being anxious to see if there is a wild puma around the corner or the perfect amount of panic when you're trying to find the right food to fill up that certain nutrition value.
Long story short if you don't get this you're just missing out on the ultimate Burger.",Apr 9 at 1:08 PM,5, 3,"Yay, thank you for your tasty review! We all love burgers here ;)  Have fun with Green Hell VR, and stay tuned for more! :)"

You're right - the game is designed exactly with the loop you've mentioned in mind! Glad you like it!"
2022-05-27 21:45:33.176586,ninjag78,Lots of potential.,"I wanted something standalone that I could immerse myself in when away from home and this looked perfect. 

I've played about four hours so far and I've died a lot, but each time I'm getting better after hunting down video guides etc. A lot of the help is for the PC version, so not always easy to transpose and not always applicable. It's a little more involving to remove the headset and look up help as opposed to task swapping to the Internet in Windows.

The graphics are very good for a standalone with some very nice lighting effects. Sounds are abundant and often revealing. 

There's a fair amount going on, although it's not as open world as I would have hoped. Perhaps this is a restriction of being standalone. At first the map does feel a little small, but as you progress there are more areas but there's still that hemmed in feeling and a moderately linear element to it. There is some nice variety though from jungle, to rocky areas and also wet lands. 

Mechanics are good as well and I particularly like how you don't have to crouch down to pick things up and instead they will snatch up to your hands if close enough. Crafting isn't always obvious but as said there are guides and you need to persevere. Collision physics helps bring realism to a higher level. 

There is a problem with crafting sometimes not working and you need to restart, which can be a pain considering how long it takes before you can save. However, the developers are aware of this and I believe a patch is coming. In the meantime my advice is to try and craft a simple axe as soon as possible to know that crafting is working before getting in too deep. 

I also get stuck when trying to teleport climb the rope during the tutorial.

Normally by this point I would have asked for a refund, but I thought this time I would give the developers a chance to make things right, so I continued playing past the two hour point 

I don't feel like there is a great deal to build and it's more a case of simply micromanaging eating and drinking, but perhaps there is more for me to find.

The ability to climb would be very helpful and jumping can be a little odd with it easy to become trapped. Hopefully that will be fixed. 

Another quick point is the swearing. It just seems unnecessary and out of place. Personally, I would have omitted it, which would also open up the game to a wider age range. 

There's probably a lot of comparisons going on with the PC title, which I've never played, but ultimately I do feel like more content and maps are needed, especially considering the price and this, along with fixing the bugs, would make this a five star review. Fingers crossed and I hope I don't regret this over waiting for the PCVR version.",Apr 22 at 7:08 AM,3, 4,

1. add ores to get metal things I know this will be a lot more crafting stuff like furnaces and stuff also mabye alloys with the metalSS (plural) but trust me if you do that it will be amazing
2. make the map not as narrow and enclosed I recommend bigger areas and just a little more less enclosed in some places
3. add more animals please that will give you more stuff
4. more food stuff
5.if you do this it will just be amazing and it is…multiplayer with this you will become such a big game i know this will be like a 10gig game that will cost like $50 and will take like a lot of development but you will become a great game if you do these I couldn’t believe this game was real

However it's not explaining well enough what you have to do and it's very confusing. 
For example you must build a hut to save the game, I wish that I knew that from the beginning. The missions are very vague like find a grappling hook in the jungle, then you just wonder around hoping to find it. If I got bitten buy a snake or a spider, what should I do?

I wish on hard mode instead of having higher metabolism (which is just annoying) you'd make the animals a lot more skittish.

2022-05-27 21:46:12.333616,MyNameisYeff24,Can be more annoying than fun.,"Cool graphics and all, but the constant need for some form of nutrient is pretty ridiculous. Every time I get on this game I spend more time looking for food or water than making any progress. Health drains way too quick and even after filling up all your bars he’ll still complain that he is hungry or thirsty. Throwing weapons is also very awkward since putting your arm behind your head is how you store items. Also some animals constantly spawn in the same exact spot no matter how many times you kill them which can ruin the immersion. Pretty cool game and wandering around the forest is pretty cool, but definitely needs some work.",Apr 20 at 8:00 AM,3, 3,

Graphics are stunning the physics are quality most of the time the only thing I would ask for is that u can turn off the guys voice! I really don’t want him telling me ever three seconds to drink water! And he really has to curse every time I get hit by something!!! I mean I have a younger sister that really likes to watch me play…if that could be a featured in the next patch or so that would really make this game golden! Till then im going to wait but that aside this game is really fun I would give it a shot if u like survival games. Just for me I’d like see where this goes in the next update or too

Before an update I was doing quite well until my character kept fainting due to tiredness and it was not so evident that you can sleep when you select it from your watch. The later update brought some updates to this, now you see a watch icon on the bed.

My character was quite often annoyed that the backpack was full (""argh! this is never going to work!!!"", Another anthem).

Overall this is a very nice game. After completing the story mode, I returned to the forest in the survival mode just to spend time in the Amazon!

You're lost in the jungle and must use your wits and crafting skills to survive from starvation, disease and the wildlife.

Four stars for the graphics and survival mode, three for the story mode as it has a few problems.

The survival mode is great but the story mode has some game breaking bugs. Objects can disappear between games. For most objects, no problem as you can replace them, but for the story it requires you to  test a blood sample in a machine with different creatures. When you play after saving and quitting, the sample is gone and there's no replacement, so you can't  complete the best ending.",Apr 24 at 12:33 AM,4, 2,"Yep, it's a full fletched out game on standalone VR!

This is my new review after the new update and playing for a few hours. First I thought there are a few small maps and it wasn’t a big map as I originally thought but turns out that it actually is. Because in order to go further in the map I needed a grappler but then I didn’t understand what to do with it as I could get it out of my backpack. But all you had to do is go to the right place to use it. I also found the indigenous people but it is almost impossible to kill them. I once killed bot of them but then died of bleeding even though I put two bandages very quickly around my arms.Also it says that they added auto save but I still can’t see where.",Apr 27 at 1:30 PM,5, 0,"Thanks a lot for revisiting your review, we appreciate you taking the time to actually try the game again :) Stay tuned for future patches for even more changes like these!"

If anyone else is dealing with not knowing how to save: 1. Open your book and hit the home icon of the bottom right 2. Click the hut image and your right toggle button. 3. There should be a white hut you can place in open areas of ground. 4. Cut down a palm tree and put the leaves in your backpack. Cut a tree and put the sticks in your backpack. Finally find some rope from a large tree 5. Hold the items in front of the white area until it turns green. Then follow instructions.

When you can save the games a lot better lol

2022-05-27 21:46:43.158967,Death Watch Mando,Honest Review,"This review can be taken many ways, but I’m just keeping it real with consumers and developers. 

First off, great job to the developers for making this game VR playable! 

My first impression was stunning. Walking into a jungle and being able to craft items for survival, is amazing. Graphics aren’t bad for a headset device and I see them improving more as time goes on and updates come out.

Crafting is pretty awesome and you really get a rhythm down when you get. My one “con” about crafting is the hand tracking gets awry. I’ll hold the trigger down to craft and start moving the objects together, and my hands start going crazy or the tracking falls short. I’ve also got my arm stuck in spots of the jungle when crafting. 

Other small issues I’ve noticed are animals glitching into fauna…swinging several times and not hitting a spider, it bites me, then it dies on the fourth swing. The first three swings hit the ground where the spider is…but the hand tracking on the weapon holding needs improvement as even attacking the Puma is hard to handle the spears. 

All in all this game is worth every penny…I know the developers will be issuing updates in the future to improve the bugs and glitches present with the release…but that shouldn’t hold anyone back from getting this game as its absolutely stunning! Unless you do t like survival games, this isn’t for you…but VR has never been better!",Apr 12 at 12:14 AM,5, 2,

2022-05-27 21:46:57.622905,DreamGeekGal,A challenging and fun VR survival game,"If you enjoy survival games or are looking for a longer VR experience with a story then Green Hell VR: Quest Edition is a great VR game.

Green Hell VR looks absolutely beautiful for a Quest-only experience. The developers have done an amazing job with the environment to create something that works on a standalone headset. 

The VR crafting experience is pretty cool. You will need to go to a tree and physically chop it down with an ax. Then you will need to pick up the various sticks and drag them to your building item. This can be a little clunky at times, but nothing unuseable. You will need to move the items around until you get them just right and they highlight green meaning you can release the trigger and they will snap in place. Overall crafting is a very interactive experience.

Although there were a few annoying parts and issues, I imagine the developers will continue to tweak the game and improve these experiences.

There is a large world to explore, a detailed narration story that is interesting and immersive, great graphics and sound, and the threat of death is always just around the corner. Green Hell VR is everything you want in a survival game.

The game definitely has it’s issues atm though, very buggy and i seem to encounter game breaking bugs more often than not.. and because this is a survival game; saving your progress isnt the easiest thing to do sometimes, so encountering one of these bugs at the wrong time leads to wasting of time and progress which is frustrating. Biggest bugs seem to based around the backpack inventory system, as well as using a bow and arrow;and when one of these 2 systems become bugged they never seem to fix themselves and will only get worse until you (save your progress if you can), quit and reload the game. But even so, the game is so good i continue to play it regardless of the issues, hopefully the devs continue to work this gem and can patch out these bugs over time.",Apr 21 at 12:48 AM,4, 2,"Thanks a lot for your extensive review, we appreciate your feedback!

Can be challenging at times, as i find myself dying from diseases a whole lot of times but i figured out what helps with that so it became alot easier for me. Its definitely a grinding game i feel, i never found myself doing nothing, theres always something to do. Can take a bit to get used to but once you get the hang of it, you will have a blast.

Players can not pick up an item sometimes or the back pack will bugs out so much that you will die from hunger or thirst trying to fix it all the time. You have to constantly eat even if you kill a big animal. Only way to save the game is building a hut, not just the bed. No multiplayer, The food spoils way too quick ( there should be a way to cover it with ash or drying it). You sleep you take damage is basically it.

Between the visuals, sound, story, voice acting and interactive mechanics in this game; it's an easy recommendation.  Now, its not easy (really at all), but it's rewarding and addictive. If you've ever enjoyed watching man vs wild, Alone, or Naked ad afraid (or really any survival show), you'll appreciate this game a lot. The crafting is clever and intuitive, and the interactive mechanics are very well thought out. 

My only complaint is the effort needed to kill a spider/scorpion. It requires 3-4 hits even if your smacking it square on with a massive stick. 1-2, depending on hit placement should be good. Hope they fix that.

 There's only one problem I've had. And to the developers, if you're reading this, please fix it because it could put people off of the game and they won't want to play again.

 If you die or quit in story mode it brings you back to the last autosave, the only problem is that the autosaves only happen everytime something to do with the story happens. Either make it autosave more often or do the thing with the⚠️ emojis around it. Also I've looked everywhere and cannot find the save button.(Had to search it up) 

*⚠️⚠️MAKE THE TEXT UNDER THE LEAF SHELTER THAT SAYS ""allows you to save the game""  BIGGER OR MOVE IT AWAY FROM THE ARROW GOING TO THE NEXT PAGE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MEAN THE NEXT PAGE HAS THE THING TO SAVE⚠️⚠️*

I don't blame the developers though because this is a fairly new game and in a month or 2 it'll most likely be a 5/5 star game or 10/10 game. 

Killing animals on a slope also sometimes drops the meat through the world and make snakes more dangerous, they just sit there and rattle but don't slither around.

 In a month I'll do another review and it'll most likely have 5/5 stars.

2022-05-27 21:47:51.252141,MightyFineBros,Buggy but Good,"I've beaten the story mode on medium difficulty and now playing survival mode on hard difficulty. There are several game-breaking bugs that can prevent you from saving, one includes frequent instances of the right arm becoming stuck/warped when using the Bow. The Bow in general is not fun to use because it's very janky compared with most other games with Bow and Arrows. Performance is problematic also, especially since world items/resources never de-spawn, thus accumulating and Performance degrades. The main character (that you play as) is very unlikable and a jerk. His voice lines are also bugged resulting in him constantly yelling obscenities at odd times/out of context of the action you're doing. This version is also heavily condensed vs the PC version so if you have a good PC probably wait for the upcoming PC VR version.",Apr 21 at 6:13 AM,5, 0,

2022-05-27 21:48:03.683131,DaddyDexmex,Wonderfully made and challenging,"Like many who reviewed this, I played the pc game. I was hesitant to buy it for a couple reasons. The PC game was hard as hell, and who wants a jaguar jumping at you in VR? Not me! But now that I’ve played this game through on story mode, and actually bit the bullet. I was pleasantly surprised! It was engaging from the beginning, small learning curve to survive the jungle. But after a while it became second nature and I knew exactly what to do when taking a fall, bite, or combating hunger. The survival mechanic was fun in itself, but I have to say. The story was incredible. I finished playing through the story in 3 days. I just couldn’t put it down. And now I’m setting up a base in survival mode and just having fun exploring. 

If you’re hesitant like me, I’d recommend taking the plunge. I’m so happy I did. This story will stay with me for quite some time. Fully immersed.",Apr 20 at 12:42 PM,5, 1,

There are four difficulty modes, ranging from tourist to a hard mode, super cool, and then there are 2 modes. They are survival and story. So far I've only tried story because that one has a tutorial. Speaking of which, I honestly still don't know if I'm done with it even though I've been playing for like an hour 😂. Even then, its packed with lots of action and an interesting story, which I won't spoil. Now to explain the actual game. The graphics are great, even as an open world game. Super smooth, lots of customizable options, makes it fun to play. No matter what, this game is fantastic 👏 👌.

2022-05-27 21:48:12.024236,samsonite312,"Great game, but difficulty needs tweaks","EDIT: Dropping the rating to 3 stars for now. The game is quite buggy, and now there are bugs that actually prevent advancing in the story. (please fix not being able to pick up the Ayahuasca recipe in the fire pit!)

I realize this is supposed to be a tough game, but it seems overly so, to the point it's highly unrealistic. There's something called the rule of threes: you can survive 3 minutes without oxygen, 3 hours without shelter, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food. Yet in this game, you're dying of hunger and thirst by the end of day 1 which is nuts and makes the game too hard.

Whether you can get safe drinking water is kind of a dice roll. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find coconuts, which will not only give you water, but also hold rain water or let you boil unclean water. Other times, coconuts are nowhere to be found, so your only option is to drink dirty water and use a particular mushroom to rid yourself of parasites.

I know it's possible to choose a different difficulty level, but it would be cool to customize that a bit. Maybe I want to slow my metabolism so it's more realistic, but I still want to face dangerous animals and hostile tribes.

Nonetheless, the game is highly engrossing and it's easy to lose track of time while playing it! There are only a few bugs I've noticed:

- discus fish are invisible once you kill them, and even once they're cooked
- sometimes haptic feedback stops working, and the game requires a restart to fix it
- sometimes things fall through rocks or other solid objects and you can't reach them
- not quite a bug, but sometimes animal respawn feels too video gamey (same animals in the same spots) and breaks immersion",25 days ago,3, 0,"Hi there!

Green Hell VR is an excellent adaptation of a good 2D survival game. It's visually impressive , one of the top tier visuals Quest 2 can offer.
It's also set up quite well to play seated.

However:

I'm very tolerant of VR, but the frame rate up- and-downs in free movement is atrocious.
Perhaps it's frame pacing? I'm susceptible to it in 2D.

This is the first VR title to make me so fatigued and cause headaches. And there's no simple save, so I'm rushing to build a hut to save before taking breaks.
When animals are running about your area, the frame rate can drop very low.

When trying to combine bandages with medicinal herbs (you can do this in 2D) one of the controllers will trigger rumble and keep buzzing until you exit the game (see above, there's no easy save).

I find my plays consist of 10 minutes doing some stuff, and the rest creating a save so I can exit.

All that said, can't wait for co-op, and certainly watching for patching.",Apr 19 at 10:02 PM,3, 3,

Number one I know this is completely up to the devs but I think there should be some more customizable difficulties and yes I know that there is already 4 different difficulties but I think it should be completely customizable. Number two one of the most annoying things that has happened to me is that I couldn’t craft anything not even a simple stone axe (in the survival part of the story mode) so I restarted the game and it got rid of all my progress in the survival bit.

The best survival you can play in VR.

I just feel a bit lacking that I can't actually put my hand on the ground comfortably, having to relay on the wireless grab system, it breaks a bit the immersion which this port masterfully craft.

I'll add a couple bug I've encountered for the devs:

1) it looks like crafting stop working at random, i had to save and exit to make it work again.
2) when I tried to put Tobacco on a bandage they both disappeared and the controller started vibrating like crazy.

The controls to building things and using your wrist watch (in game status, etc) feel clunky, but you get by. The problem is, I didn't have much fun.

Maybe the Quest 2 just isn't powerful enough to handle more interaction.

I will give the devs props for extreme use of asw and trying to give us something that LOOKS great, but the combat is way sparse,wooden and truly unsatisfying.  So while this works as a pretty eating simulator, the rest just feels clunky and tacked on. Comparisons to WDSS end with the backpack and bandages, because walking dead has amazing physics interactions, polished gameplay from day one and amazing combat. Also when I hear the lead dev in an interview saying he's unwilling to sacrifice the many useless and rotten items that litter your maps for the sake of improving frame rate and lag, I begin to lose all hope lol Sorry, and as far as not being able to make a truly open world game on Quest2...tell that to Into The Radius and GTA San Andreas.

I have a few videos on twitch showing in game gameplay if you are looking for a real life gameplay video. Just look for rex_easily on twitch. First few days are easy as I haven’t ventured to deep into the story, but enjoying every second of the game, even when I am lost or uncertain what to do next, as would happen in real life scenario. 
Only downfall I have with the game is it can get a little glitchy when walking across tree stumps or through rocks and bumpy terrain. I have found my character getting stuck in certain spots and when attempting to jump out of the spot my hero gets tired before making out of the spot which he is stuck in. Also picking up items I find myself picking up items I am not hovering over which can be a little annoying but overall not an issue that will stop me from playing the game. 
I am also easily prone to getting motion sick in VR games and this one while I have had some sweating from the motion, I am finding myself able to continue playing without breaking after 10 minutes, which is a huge plus.

But I will say two things, one  I believe they should make leeches less often, and (this one’s kinda a joke) where I fount the machete at the stonehedge place there was a pit, when I walked into it it was a pit to a void, where I was just stuck falling.

2022-05-27 21:49:22.483209,Ricky.bravo,Green Hell,This is the 3rd time writing a review for Green Hell and now that I've spent quite a bit of time playing it I can give my final opinion on it. There is good points and bad points abd overall its a decent game but it needs more time for the kicks to get ironed out. The general game play is good and it's a pretty immersive game and when I'm right into it then it could be the Amazon jungle I'm in and the sounds and visuals are decent. It's defo a lot of fun exploring and just generally walking around discovering stuff. The story has enough to keep you interested but without spoiling anything is cool that there's more than one. Once the story is complete however the game can be a little repetitive and not really enough to keep me really interested but OK. I will say however that it's been a bit glitchie and its been very frustrating sometimes especially when time spent building a camp to save the game only to die and be sent back to a much earlier point. Another frustrating thing is the picking up of objects which is easy enough if it's just one thing but if you try to pick up a specific item in a pile of various things then it's a bit annoying. I also fell through a oblivion hole and continued to fall for a long time and animals flew past at very fast rate which was weird. There's a few little things that need ironed out and if they get sorted then this will be a top game.,Apr 29 at 5:13 AM,4, 1,"Woah, thanks for such an extensive review of Green Hell VR! We are glad a genuine die-hard fan of Green Hell reviewed our game as we really wanted to stay true to the original gameplay as much as possible while making it a fletched-out VR game.

Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the lower reviews for somethings. I understand you want to keep it as close to the original game as possible, but sfter completing the story which was so fun (story lasts a good 7 hours) but after completing story you kind of left with a game where you cannot do anything. The survival there isn't a goal, I understand you can make your own goals but I kind of just unlocked the map and made a base and it's kinda just sitting collecting dust right now.

However, when I think of a survival game with radio communications and other combat elements I’m automatically drawn to want to have someone else to play this with. Another downside and true immersion breaker for this game is the swinging mechanic. When I go to swing an axe or anything for that matter my wrist should not look/feel like a pool noodle that’s about to snap off my arm on every swing. This is why I can’t get behind walking dead saint and sinners. I love the flint aspect to starting fires but the swinging mechanics really kill it for me unfortunately.. For anyone who wants a true Survival experience in VR check out The Forest. It’s not on quest because it’s too good to be, but you can play this gem via steam VR",Apr 12 at 8:49 PM,2, 2,"Hi there!

I try skip climbing down and it freezes on me. It's just minor bugs but they happen at the wrong moment when I dont need it too.  Also the holding of spear weapons when you hand get caught somewhere no matter how high you reach up to get the spear forward.also when swimming sometimes ge stay at the bottom, you would have to keep quitting the game for each bug....

Watched YouTube videos and I don't have the green guide that pops up to show the stone attaching to the stick. After trying to find answers the only one I came across is not to finish tutorial, so I started a new save, skipped tutorial as soon as it loaded in and still can't craft it.

When you do that, the game enters crafting mode with green, semi-transparent ghosts displayed on top of the items you hold.

Please patch and make better because I am on my 3rd survival play through and I can't even play with all the problems.  I still rate it high because it is beautiful and has potential but the quest has so few survival games and this would be great if it worked well.",Apr 18 at 12:07 PM,4, 1,

2022-05-27 21:50:57.912240,FuzzyApple01,I love this game,After waiting a while for a good survival game. This has to be one of my favorites I have for my quest because I feels so real. Yes I would like the world to be more realistic but for what it is it’s great. Like when it’s night time in the game it’s kinda creepy because of how real if feels and you get that adrenaline of fear and excitement at the same time when your walking through the jungle.  I personally got really excited when I would find stuff I would need to survive. So after I’ve said all that this is a great addition to my quest games. 💜💜,Apr 8 at 1:53 PM,5, 1,"Wow, thank you very much! We worked on delivering a game that is both immersive and authentic, and it's wonderful that you find Green Hell VR so appealing :)"

2022-05-27 21:51:04.145498,itznotfunny,I want to play but…,I really want to like and love this game but it have many flaws from bugs to being very confusing. First I wish there was a difficultly level that could tweak how much information the game gives you along with a setting form damage caused. Second I found two bugs that are stopping my progress one is that sometimes I can’t craft or build at all until I go back to the menu which will reset my progress back to my last save the next bug is that tribal warriors can shoot though objects which makes healing a lot harder. I would love to give this game a 5 stars but until these bugs are fixed it’s not getting played.,Apr 18 at 4:28 AM,2, 2,"Hello and thank you for your feedback! We will be improving on many aspects of the game to make it more enjoyable. Crafting will be fixed in the next patch, but in the case of tribal warriors shooting through the objects - we have to investigate it further.

The game seems really great And I am enjoying it however I just made it Passed the memory potion and had to restart once again there are no places to save my progress And it is now becoming tiresome and old,Apr 11 at 7:44 AM,3, 2,"Hello and thank you for your opinion. I've passed it to the dev team. Crafting - you get the bug that will be fixed in the upcoming patch. For know we have to ask you to reload the save. After that crafting should work fine.

2022-05-27 21:51:14.572218,Papa Goose,Amazing game! 2 suggestions,"This game is amazing really well done graphics are pretty good love the features! I could go on about all the things that I love about this game but I don’t really want to. I haven’t played it too much but I already love it. 
￼
-One thing that I would love to see is the ability to turn off specific hostile creatures. Like insects because I find it quite annoying to walk and randomly get hurt because I stepped on a scorpion. Or spiders because I have arachnophobia. I would love to see this feature added because I want to play with hostile mobs but I really don’t want to see spiders.

Overall this game is amazing!￼!! I can’t wait to see this game grow!

-A way to turn off swearing would be nice. Or a way to just turn of all speaking even in survival mode because dialogue setting still doesn’t turn that off. Please add these soon.",Apr 8 at 9:54 AM,5, 1,

Great game.

I love survival games i was going to buy the forest but when i found this game coming out to oculus i waited for it since last year and believe me it’s worth the wait
I just don’t like 1 thing i got motion sickness because i am easy to motion sickness to movement games 😭😭😭😭 which is not the game’s fault",Apr 8 at 9:44 AM,5, 1,"Hello! Sad to hear you have problems with the motion sickness :( Perhaps the comfort options, available in the menu, can help? Try also teleportation mode - it was designed to be less intrusive than free walking. Hope that helps and see you back in Hell, Green Hell VR! :)"
2022-05-27 21:51:20.758784,AgonisingBliss,Excellent for a vr game.,"From what I can gather, a lot has been stripped from this game to make it fit on quest. But, having not played the original, I still feel there is a full game here. It loses a star for being a bit finicky at times. Hard to chase and stab sometimes. Could do with a bit more polish. 

But my days. What an amazing experience.... wandering the rainforest just surviving on your own is so much fun. The scorpions and tarantulas look awesome so if you have a fear of them, then they will look quite real to you. Can highly recommend this game to anyone into survival games. Varying difficulty levels make the game accessable to almost everyone. 

Quick side note.... Unlike some other games like walkabout golf the graphics can hurt my eyes after a while so I can only play an hour at a time. But that may just be me being new to vr.",Apr 17 at 7:22 PM,4, 0,

The first time I was only playing for about 10-15 minutes and the second time I was only playing about 30 minutes. The migraine lasted all night! Now I have several VR games, and this is the only game this has happens in so far. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to  fully enjoy it because of that, so I’m returning this game. However, if you can get past the motion sickness the game is cool!",Apr 25 at 10:15 PM,2, 1,"Hi there!

2022-05-27 21:51:33.280438,MrSurviv0r,A BRUTAL and beautiful survival game!,"This game is brutal!!! You get a basic tutorial and they just throw you in the jungle, literally! A massive hat off to the devs for what they pulled off natively on the Quest 2.

You get 2 modes out of the box. Story and Survival Mode. With co-op coming a bit down the line...Is it worth it? If you love hard-core survival games that do not tell you everything and throws your hand rather than holds it, then YES! 

I didn't play the flat-screen version, so this is my first perspective on the game. It works really well, & plays smoothly. Which is amazing because when you see this game in headset it's pure wizardry how well it runs! The only small issues I've had are with sound and they were easily fixed by saving then restarting from that point. For example: I had a night time session where the crickets of the night sound meshed with a waterfall sound and it distorted pretty bad. Reloading in fixed this though. That's it, no crashing. 

I've played for several hours now and it's super easy to lose track of time because the immersion is real! The crafting system while simple in how extensive it gets is well done and intuitive! Balancing your levels (fats, protein, hydration, and carbs) is a real challenge! The unforgiving jungle is very atmospheric! I ABSOLUTELY recommend this for hard-core survival fans! 👊🍺",Apr 17 at 12:34 AM,4, 0,

This was before i had an oculus but anyway when i figured out you gig make one for quest i was gonna explode needless to say i love shooting capybaras and acting like a hunter but heres some thing i think will bring this to a whole other level

1. Co-Op.    Yes me and my friends back to back crafting and relentlessly fighting scorpions and other things

2. Guns.  I know that the original game doesnt have this but it would be awesome to be able to come across like a 1911 and maybe you could mine for stone and get iron too and make loads of new things

3. Battle. Where you just battle tribes in a little 1v1 arena

This game will get a solid 4.8 for me the graphics are a little on the flimsy side but then again this game launched like 2 weeks ago so i cant really complain because i have big hopes for this game and know its gonna be epic.",Apr 15 at 4:19 PM,4, 1,

It's a true miracle and hard work from the Dev Team that this game even runs on the Quest 2 with pretty good performance. It has everything from the Flatscreen game, but has a significantly smaller, more linear map and doesn't have a crafting table, resulting simplified versions of crafting. It's also one of the best looking Quest 2 games to date!

This game is truly amazing and you definitely should buy it!!
I'm giving it 4 stars because of the simplified, more stripped down version that this game is. Also your character gets way too hungry, so you do nothing else than hunting all the time.

It's very complex and detailed and very fun but the more you play the more you feel like something is missing. You'd be right as they had to remove some features in order to make it possible for this to play smoothly on the quest. Some crafting recipes have been removed and the game feels more simple than it's flat counter part. Hopefully they can manage to bring it all back without the game having to suffer because that complexity is what made the original version great.,Apr 11 at 12:59 PM,4, 1,"Hi, thanks for your feedback!

2022-05-27 21:53:12.866440,cCheerSs,"Great game, but needs more polishing.","Good game, lots of potential, however it still needs quite some work. FPS sometimes drops quite a lot, only way to ""fix"" it is by restarting the game. Your in-game arms are moving weirdly, it's not a big deal, but still.. They are like rubber, arms moving in all directions like noodles. Some items feel too heavy and weird to hold/manipulate, there goes the next problem, sometimes it's very uncomfortable to put something into inventory. I had some problems putting spear into inventory and quickly accessing it later. Speaking of inventory UI, I'm personally not a big fan of it. It's similar to TWD's Saints & Sinners, but worse IMHO. But hey, it works and shows the important info of item you are pointing at. Just my 2 cents. 

It would also be quite nice if we could change how toolbelt is set, I believe it may be called offset? Basically an option that lets us move the toolbelt higher or lower, closer to our body or vice versa sticking out for better reach.

I actually encountered quite a lot of issues in-game and while I really want to like ir and enjoy it (first I need to learn how to survive at least a few days..), I just found myself in a lot of unpleasant situations where game was acting weirdly,  so I believe there is quite some work for devs to do with it in the nearest future. Just to improve the overall performance and clunky movement/interactions with items here and there.

Other than that, it's a solid game, never played it on PC, so no idea how comparable these two versions are, but there are quite some things to do. Gathering food, materials, crafting items, following storyline. Totally worth a shot.",Apr 11 at 11:06 PM,4, 1,"Thank you for your very detailed feedback, it helps us a lot. We will look into the issues you mentioned. It might take a while since that's a really long list. Hope you will stick around to this time! Happy exploring!"

I enjoyed the beautiful environment and challenging management of food, stamina, sanity etc. When i was ready to get off for the night i saved at my shelter and quit the game. When i launched the game the next day and tried to load my save file the screen went completely black and i couldn’t do anything. I tried restarting my headset but no luck. I ended up deleting the game and re-installing it before starting over on a new save, and same story. I got off for the night and the next day couldn’t load my save. It was especially frustrating because i had just made the second Ayahuasca getting me to an interesting part in the story. Until this issue is fixed i cant see myself giving the game any higher of a rating.",Apr 13 at 11:25 AM,2, 1,

If you have played the original game and enjoyed it you should still give this one a shot. There are a lot of features missing like base building, checking your legs, and the map is way small than the original, like way smaller. I mean it's still big but it's no where near the original. But the game is still really good and think it's worth a shot.Oh yeah, the story is the same in case you were looking for a new one.

Few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking for me yet.

What happens when your’e low on energy? I made a bed and there was no option to  sleep in it? No tutorial. Are the controls broken? 

It says to make a spear, just ‘sharpen’ a stick. How? The sharp rocks just break the stick.

You can sleep by using your smartwatch. Tap on it until you find the sleeping watch face. Notice that the watch will tell you if you will sleep on the ground or the bed. To go sleep simply tap and hold a sleeping watch face.

2022-05-27 21:59:33.412336,TheJackOfNoTrades,I’m just here to say,"PSA: Multiplayer is coming in a update so stop complaining you idiots!

Real Review: I can really see the good game in here… Unfortunately that game is locked behind janky controls, bad performance, and some bugs. Look I can see that this game has had effort put in, it’s definitely more polished than that next fest demo a few months back but I mean come on! I paid $30 for this and it’s technically just a slightly less buggy, worse looking, and worse preforming game? I was really looking forward to this game, it’s seemed to have it all. Realistic mechanics, good visuals, good physics, interaction. Everything seemed great but this?

Well this isn’t the game I was hoping for… 
It didn’t even have all the features it promised hell some are even missing from the demo! Like the ability to check your legs, that seemed to be a big point in the buildup to the release the whole “fully interactive body” thing doesn’t really work when you have no legs and you can’t even physically crouch. Not to mention there is no option to turn off artificial turn.

Look I have controller drift in my oculus touch controls so I like to turn artificial turning off but this game doesn’t even let me do that! 

I am sorry to the devs they are really cool people who were putting in work for this game to get out the door but it really didn’t work out for me. I hope the PCVR version will be better so I can play that instead until then I guess the forest VR will have to do for my survival games.

Really this is one of the biggest let downs I have had like the performance seems REALLY BAD like the trailer seemed so smooth and I thought they were gonna do some magic to get this running on a quest but holy I should have kept my instinct and not trusted space warp. I have used it on PC and it always makes the game worse for me I would rather have a stutter than a sneered image wherever there is motion.

So yeah Bad Performance, Bad Physics, Bad Sound Quality, Lacking Features, and the use of space warp. Can’t say I recommend this game at least in its current state…

Again devs I am sorry I am gonna follow this game from a distance and see if it gets any better so best of luck with it guys!",Apr 8 at 5:36 AM,2, 47,"Thanks for your review! We want to let you know, that your feedback will help us to improve the game even further. Your message is analyzed right now and we will take action to make Green Hell better for you. Also, please keep in mind we are developing those games (Meta and PCVR) separately, so they offer different experiences. We might add some more features in the future, that are present in the PCVR version, so please stay tuned for that! :)"

The graphics are fantastic on Quest 2 also the jungle sounds. The VR interactions are intuitive and very immersive, after a short time you forget everything around you and have arrived in the jungle with all your senses. 

 kudos to the developers for supporting so many different languages.
I would only wish for the future 
that you can set the level of difficulty yourself.
This means that you can activate or deactivate each individual point of the three levels of difficulty by  yourself. 

The backpack is sometimes a bit difficult to handle, things fall too easily and you lose valuable time, that works better in Saints & Sinners, for example.

2022-05-27 22:01:53.636638,paul.ski96,Immersive and challenging,Truly recommend if your into survival thriller with some realism splashed in. Does have a couple improvements needed but no doubt it will be at its best once they come out with a patch update from the reviews and multiplayer to come with it once they drop the PSVR version in may.,Apr 8 at 10:36 AM,4, 8,
2022-05-27 22:01:55.689747,TrentBrown101,Amazing!,Green Hell is great! I've seen alot of reviews complaining about no instructions and no help but that's the beauty of it. Its a learning experience like no other and you get trapped into this immersive jungle world full of sounds and predators and new stuff around every corner. The games great and there is so much to do and build. Cant believe how good it looks on the quest btw. Definitely recommend purchasing!,Apr 9 at 10:33 AM,5, 3,Hi! Thank you very much for your review. It's nice to hear you like it so much! Happy exploring (and watch out for big cats;) )

You have a fish on the ground and stab it with a stick it will fall under the map. 3 if you have a coconut bowl and put a snail in it your arm goes crazy and it's acting like it really heavy. Those are the glitches I've found",Apr 9 at 1:03 AM,5, 4,Thank you for your feedback! We should be able to deal with those glitches in the upcoming patch! Stay tuned for it :)
2022-05-27 22:02:01.896429,Manhopper,Looks visually stunning for Q2,"Only played survial mode, not yet story mode
The survival mode is fun just exploring the landscape and the beautiful looking environment.
The devs have said they will add to the map which will be great.
It is still rather difficult even on the easiest setting and no save unless you make a shelter apparently is the only downside. Would be cool to add auto save.",19 days ago,5, 0,"Hi there! Thanks a lot for your review and feedback, we genuinely appreciate it. We will think about adding some form of auto save, especially in survival.

2022-05-27 22:02:03.947343,TogaGames,Wasn’t expecting that!,"When downloading I thought it was a regular survival game. Only to find the story mode version. It was a long campaign but was totally worth it. The story was great and was definitely a roller coaster. My only complaint is that some of the graphics where a bit janky. Such as items being bellow ground, animals fazing through walls, dropped items falling out of the world, and even a few animals spawning right in front of me and giving me a heart attack. Other than that I think it’s a great game and it definitely challenges your skills of survival.",9 days ago,4, 0,"Hi there! Thanks for the review :) We will be working on improving the graphics, as we are using ASW and it can make things look janky - it's a new technology but it makes the game look better in comparison.

Last thing I would very very want to add in the game is places were you can loot up for example abounded house we’re will be guards and loot such as food, resources, weapons (like  better pickaxe, axes)  About patches I would patch is a backpack, it doesn’t work sometimes so you have to take it out over over again",14 days ago,4, 1,"Thanks a lot for your feedback, we understand your concerns with those little problems you've mentioned.

2022-05-27 22:02:20.552204,LionheartUK,Fantastic Game. But.,"Green Hell is almost a true AAA game on Quest. Stunning Visuals & Fantastic audio. But it has some glaring issues that need to be addressed before it earns that extra A.

Cons:
1. Lack of control customization.
2. Arms & hands don't align with controllers. Arms are still very bent when yours are straight. Both make it hard to detach leaches and cause a lot of controller / Arm clashing.
3. Character becomes very loud and annoying when hungry constantly using voice ques relentlessly.
4. Some save state issues when loading to camp E.G Permanent rain that lasts your entire hunger cycle and Q2 battery life. essentially making progress impossible because you cant cook meat. 
5. Almost Zero guidance on status effects some labels in the menu would be a good add. 
6. Some resources don't seem to spawn correctly. Like nuts that are key to survival. Others spawn super fast. Snakes and Scorpions seem to spawn by you just looking away or moving like 10m away. Leaches appear on you almost constantly. 
7. Tools break Superfast even by Survival game standards.
8. Save menu at camp can be activated from very far away. Given the limited space if you are making things remotely near your camp you will activate the save menu. 

Pros.
1. Stunning visuals for Quest. Blows almost everything out of the water. 
2. Sound quality is immersive and fantastic. 
3. Building, gathering and crafting make full use of VR . 

Overall Worth the price. But would need to see most of the cons addressed to bump this up to 5 stars. A true Survival game for quest. Not just another Demo/gimmic game.",Apr 8 at 9:15 PM,4, 5,"Woah! Thanks a lot for the exhaustive and elaborate feedback on Green Hell VR. We really apprecaite it and our technical team as well as design team will look at it thoroughly. As for the cons you've mentioned, we will be working on improving the comfort options and controls even further to cater to every player's needs. Also, with the newest patch, the annoying voice quess may be less annoying, but stay tuned for a further announcement! We will be also working on improving the instructions given to the player so that you will feel much more rewarded once you get it right. We're glad you enjoyed our graphic and sound design as we've worked hard collectively to create the most realistic survival experience on Meta Quest! Hopefully, once we improve on the aspects you've mentioned, you will revisit the game and your review - you shouldn't be disappointed! :D"

2022-05-27 22:02:28.806311,MrBullied-,"Finally, survival SIM perfection ❤️🥰","If you love realistic survival simulation games then this game will be a dream come true for you 🥰 I don't know how this game runs so well, very well done to the Devs 💪 I've never been so immersed in a game like this one 👌 I just can't wait for the multiplayer now, I'll literally be on the game constantly 😁 

Also little tip for those who are new to realistic survival games, because they can be frustrating.
Make sure when you sit down to play this game you have a fair amount of time to get used to the controls and the gameplay because the game gives you a brief tutorial but after that your pretty much on your own, so you need time to experiment with things, otherwise you will just get frustrated with the game. This isn't a game you can just jump into for 10 minz. 

So yeah my tip in short is ""make time to get fully into the game and experiment with stuff in the game""",Apr 8 at 11:37 PM,5, 3,"Hi! Thank you for cherishing Green Hell VR so much. And yes, we are working on bringing co-op mode to the game, so please, stay tuned :)"

As studios like Armiture and Incuvo nail the VR UI and interactions, it makes me hopeful that bigger players (IOI *cough*) will take note.

Green Hell pro-tip: if you leave coconut shells sitting out and up in the rain they collect the water, so you don’t have to boil the water from a stream to make it safe to drink (good luck keeping that fire lit in the rain, anyway).",Apr 9 at 2:35 AM,5, 3,"Thanks for your kind review!

I hope you can make it where you are able to cut your self. I know it’s a disadvantage but it will make it more realistic. Also, when I throw things in the water it just goes right through it. Doesn’t even make a “plop” sound. Finally, I don’t like how if I’m trying to grab things off my arm (leeches) It will make me grab my walk talki or my note pad

2022-05-27 22:02:43.250107,BeatzCreations,Refunded until optimised,"Was really looking forward to this (as was i with the PC version but the demo for that was an unstable mess so had my fingers crossed for this version)

Standing still in the forest acrually looks really good for a Quest game but then walking and turning had frame drops that i expect more from a PC game running on a system not with correct graphic settings, not a quest standalone game with no options to change how it runs.

Tried to get passed the frames and occasional stutter to get a bit into the game but for me its too noticable.

On top of this is the VERY odd choice to have the objective PERMANTELY placed infront of you. (Example - at the start your first task is find the camp. Cool but i dont need it to he displayed in my view the whole time until i actualy came across the camp! What was the logic behind this?? You get the journal a short time after the start so just start with that and let that be the place to look if you forget your next story task, having it just as part of the hud to me makes no sense at all and is just in the way.

Refunding the game and may come back after any updates (hoping more on the PC version to be in a better (playable) state when that releases and will try that again)",Apr 10 at 2:04 AM,2, 4,"Hey, thank you for your detailed review.

It's beautiful,  fun and extremely difficult.  I obviously haven't gotten very far in this game, but omg! I believe I'll be playing/exploring this jungle for many months.  I'm currently learning how not to die and failing miserably lol. The sights, sounds and mechanics are spot on. I'm actually shocked how well it's running on the Quest2.  Money very well spent. After I learn to survive a little better I'll update. For now, though,  holy smokes!!!!  I'm a 52 year old gamer who is already a massive fan of this game, literally  over night.

First of this game is of is beautiful (one of the best looking ones on the quest) and these stunning graphics really build immersion. This game gave me one of the best moments I have ever had in VR, I was sitting by the campfire at night cooking some rattle snake meat, it was incredibly peaceful and gave me a burst of happiness that I have never gotten from a VR game. Gameplay wise it is great, it is everything I dreamed Green Hell would be in VR. Crafting is well done (although sometimes can be clunky). Exploration is perfect and feels almost endless! I loved exploring the beautiful vast Amazonian jungle. This game is hard, there are many dangers that will lead you to death. Due to me playing this game on flatscreen I understand everything so there is not much for me to learn however for a brand new player I can see it being really hard to learn. A few cons are some performance drops, slight clunkiness and a few minor things here and there. Overall I think Green Hell VR was perfectly pulled off and is incredibly fun! I 100% recommended.",Apr 9 at 6:45 PM,5, 2,"Yay, thank you! That's the experience we were aiming for when developing the game.

I just woke up at 3am to find him still at it and he’s not a gamer! 
The bad? They still need to work on a few glitches and I found a few pixilated areas but most of the glitches are minor cosmetic stuff. You can get 12 to 20 hours gameplay on the storyline mode alone depending on the difficulty level you choose. After you complete the story they have survivor mode as well.

There's a lot of things out there that can kill you and it's pretty amazing. I do love the leech. You have to manually pull them off and I kind of think it's pretty cool.

The ""open world"" is just a Long Corridor...

Example you should have to look at menus or tap a to flip a switch  in vr best experience is doing the motion making you feel like you’re there. And let me tell you being in a dark wet cave with a fire slowly dying, having to hammer wooden poles into the ground with a rock for a makeshift tent while managing a fire that’s slowly dying and cupping your hands in the river to drink some water. The graphics are amazing for a port.

I did jump straight into survival and didn’t try story mode but i would like some hints on how to save my progress. Overall, a very good game.

It spawns you without telling you any tutorial without showing you anything. There's absolutely no reason to have this game nor to get this game. I would not recommend it to anyone. Saints and sinners. Walking Dead is so much better, so much more fluid so much more into it. I'm currently requesting a refund which there is no option for us, so I have to go through the Oculus website itself. Another shady thing brought by the developers of this game.

2022-05-27 22:04:05.801956,captnhogcrnkr,Best Hardcore Survival Game for VR,"This is not an easy game. If you don't like the grind of survival games, this  will not change your mind. I do like the difficulty options because it's extremely frustrating to be trying to just learn how to play a game like this while getting absolutely clapped by just existing for 20 minutes. All of the micro managing your needs and how specific those needs are is a big annoying compared to a game like The Forest but this really goes in. 
The simple things just feel so cool in VR. They also crush your soul even more in VR. 
I was having a tough time finding tinder, but I manged to get my first fire going in the middle of the night. I grabbed some fish, 2 coconut bowls of water and sat by the fire while they all heated up. I was sitting on the floor in real life and it just felt so cool. I had my backpack to my left and was just crafting things while sitting by the fire waiting in dinner. I ate my fish and drank a bowl of water...but then...I grabbed my second bowl of water a bit too fast. It spilled and put out my fire. Not only did I not have any tinder left, but I couldn't see squat. Here I am, sitting on the ground in the pitch black jungle in nearly dead silence. All this after I was having a blast eating and crafting. I stood up and of course I slowly went through the jungle looking for tinder. This would all be so boring and tedious in a flat game. If you have fun with those things in non VR, this will suck you in like a black hole. The game itself looks pretty good, runs well, sounds great and is fairly immersive. I would reccomend giving this a shot on the easier difficulties to just get the hang of the game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are really neat. I find myself enjoying this game for hours without actually getting much done. I do wish the building and crafting had more to offer but that's because I want more from this game...not because I don't think it's good. I give 4 out of 5 stars because the game is not perfect. Sometimes grabbing things in the world is very frustrating and can lead to your death very quick. Dying because your grabbing a stick next to you instead of your item on your hip in a game where you can only manually save at a shelter is CRUSHING in a bad way. You will die due to bad decisions and nature all the time but dying because your in game character isn't reacting how you are sucks. The game does look good but the ground being this flat and kind of strange texture is very odd. To be fair, you come into a quest game like this expecting much worse though. Sound and performance are great. It will drain the life of your quest like hell but that's not really a fault of the game. If you're even mildly interested and have 30 bucks to spare, buy the game. Support this studio for what they've done. The fact that they got it to where it is on this hardware AND it's not just a buggy mess like a lot of AAA games are these days is fantastic. I'd much rather support a passionate studio like this than give money to companies pushing out annual copy paste jankfests.",Apr 9 at 11:38 PM,4, 2,"Wow, the story you shared is astounding! That's the experience we wanted to deliver - a world where every decision matters and where you can sit by the fire and eat something you hunted all by yourself using only makeshift weapons.

It doesn't feel like that on quest at all and even though I've read that the game has been changed a bit from the original verison to make it better suited for the quest hardware it does feel underwhelming at all and its my preferred verison of the game. For example I don't have to try to figure out how to pull the leeches off my arms I just do it. 

I've played for several hours now and each session has lasted until the battery has died! Really cool game and it's really great how they've made the menus and crafting feel so natural to VR. I've heard the PC verison will be the original game and it makes me wonder if this will still be the better verison in the end.

I had no idea how to sleep, so I sat at the camp with an axe I found for protection. I drank some parasitic water from a stream, then was jumpscared by a crocodile.

2022-05-27 22:04:43.035290,WickedA,Mind Blown,"Let me preface this by saying I didn’t look up anything nor did I play the standard version prior to this. I was not prepared for the emotional rollercoaster the story sent me on. At different points during the story play through I thought I had it figured out only to be completely wrong. I would encourage new players to do zero storyline research as it made the game that much more amazing! 

The survival gameplay is extremely challenging as you’re learning, and you will die….a lot. Once you start to get the hang of things though you fall into a groove and learn what you need to do each day. I do hope future updates bring more building aspects, but I also understand this game is pushing the quest 2 to its absolute limits. 

There are a few minor issues with the game. Throwing the spear is too chaotic and uncontrollable. I ended up just using the spear as a rattlesnake farming tool lol. There is no real inventory management without going through crazy extra steps to organize where things are.

I’m honestly surprised with how well Green Hell was ported to the quest. It’s gorgeous and tons of fun. Anyone who enjoys just playing survival will absolutely love this, and anyone who wants a solid story/survival along the same lines of Song in the Smoke style will also find that here.

My face was hurting from wearing my oculus but I had to keep going. Finally gave in at 230am because I have to be up in four hours for an event. 

I gave a venomous frog a ride in my backpack and stole a birds nest ☺️ this game makes me do wild things. 

Check your stats every so often and don't let thirst sneak up on you. I love how immmersive this game is, I was able to drink water from the river without a container but then I died... probably form dysentery 😌 but next round I killed a Capybara by smashing it with a giant rock and ate a raw steak 😵‍💫 

Think outside the box and you will do just fine, anything can be of use, don't overlook carrying items with you, you can always get rid of things later if your backpack gets full.

2022-05-27 22:05:01.593651,ColtMcMoney,Yes the survival game I’ve been wanting,"Buy it. It’s the best survival game on vr in my opinion theres story mode and survival. List of things you can do

Spear fish 

Drink coconut water then crack it open and eat the meat and after you eat the meat it turns into a bowl for fresh water from waterfalls

From water fall you can put your hands together to make a palm of your hand to have water once you fill your hand up

Hunting

SOOOO MUCH MOREEE!!! 

10/10 I’m addicted",Apr 9 at 7:49 AM,5, 1,Thank you for your review and for recommending our game to other players. We are happy that you like it so much! Happy hunting!

You get a watch to use the compass, sleep, see time and your well being. You get a journal that automatically writes notes or show what cures things or how to build weapons. You also get a backpack later on for storage. Make sure to play story first so you get used to it before you do Survival.",Apr 9 at 6:55 AM,5, 1,"Thank you for your review!

Has awesome physics and really hard and amazing survival skill, I had a really hard time playing on the flat screen mode but in VR it’s so much easier because you don’t need a axe or a rock to break open a coconut it’s VR so you can just bang i against a tree! In my opinion this game had the most outstanding graphics on quest, I have been playing VR for years now and this one really WOWED me, if you like hardcore survival games and a forest environment then this game is a MUST BUY! the did a awesome job balancing the game and they definitely delivered.",Apr 8 at 9:39 PM,5, 1,"Yay!

I wad not dissapointed however i know its a vr so there will be some streamligning howevwr i was a tad dissapointed in the map as i was expecting the original games map. This is not a complaint but the way that a single scratch can ruin your entire game is amazing attention to deatil however slightly annoying😅,Apr 8 at 5:56 PM,5, 1,"Hi! Thank you for your feedback.

I wish you could check your legs like pc VR and console and I hate how you make knives and spearheads with grainy stone instead of glassy flint hense the name flintnapping. So far this game is good and can't wait for multiplayer.,Apr 8 at 3:37 PM,5, 1,"Hello!

Multiplayer survival craft is cool and all but there’s something intimate and frightening about being alone, fully immersed. This game does it right. Crisp graphics, excellent crafting, and the environment is surreal. Walking to gather materials and off behind you a soft crunch in the brush. A jaguar stalks you. Buy the game.

It’s definitely the most realistic survival game at the moment, which makes it difficult but difficulty makes it fun. There is one thing that I don’t enjoy about this game, it’s that it feels a lot smaller than the non-vr edition of this game, like it feels like I have a lot less space than I do in the non-vr edition. But other than that it’s definitely my favourite survival game right now, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and realistic vr survival game!",Apr 8 at 8:51 PM,5, 1,"Thank you for recommending our game :) You're right, the game may feel smaller than the flat version when we talk about the jungle, or how much ground one has to cover to get somewhere, yet still, in terms of mechanics and story, it's the same game.

2022-05-27 22:05:26.428013,timberlu ,Still early days.,"Been playing for a couple hours now. It's visuals are amazing, you get a real sence of emersion. However I've not being able to get far or do much due to slight bugs and janks. It gets rather frustrating sitting waiting for your water to boil in the coconut for it to then all spill out onto the campfire and put it out, or your arm to glitch out and not pick up your freshly made soup to then again spill it all.

Another bug I've found is I'm unable to craft any tools or weapons, not sure if that's a game mechanic while having low energy, which leads me to say, though there is a slight tutorial, having something more indepth would be super helpful.

Although there's bugs, and a learning curve in the mix, it's still early days. And there's so much more to the game out of the story to be thinking about. you get a real sence of danger, though i can imagine that'll decrease when you learn the predator placements, throughout the map. every plant and fungi you hesitate to eat, not knowing what'll happen though you have no choice because you're starving. You'll find yourself fumbling around trying to find those vital resources trying to survive.",Apr 22 at 3:54 AM,3, 0,"Oh, so sorry for the inconvenience!

2022-05-27 22:05:30.575496,Ghøst287,The best VR game on Quest 2,"Green Hell VR is one of THE most immersive, mysterious, adventurous survival games, that is not also fun, but great if you love wild life. The story mode I have played so far is awesome. The only downside to the game is how there is no leg inspection, but that does not hold the game back too much. The way you have to craft materials, cook food, and even fighting tribesman makes this game so good. Even with stand alone VR, it runs so smoothly, and I have not had any performance issues. There is a few bugs here and there, but I promise you it will not ruin the fun, as they aren’t game breaking. I also love the idea how the campaign is free roam, and how it “sets you free.” Also, just a tip for the beginners, the game isn’t auto save, so to save, you have to make an easy little tent, that even says on the bottom of the page how it is a game save. So far, its a 10/10 for me.",Apr 8 at 9:36 AM,5, 1,

Theres a interesting story challenging but rewarding gameplay that has you plugging your headset on and off each time it reaches 30% battery so you can try and further your progress in the jungle. The community is very awesome too and this game Definitely sets a new bar for quest 2 games. Its a breath of fresh air, open world experience that has so much to do. We truly have a once in a lifetime experience on our hands here and this will (as i said) set a new bar for quest games in performance, graphics, gameplay etc. weather  its running from a jaguar or sitting by the fire, this game is a rewarding game.

No I am not marking it down for not having multiplayer even though I feel I should. Any game like this coming on the quest without seems like there was not enough effort in it. But I do need some time to just go it alone.

What I am upset about it lack of options to be someone else, like a female, when playing outside story mode. Might be silly but yea.

Super amazing game though! I haven’t added in animals yet… yea I’m slow BUT the details. Best game out so far and I own most!",Apr 17 at 2:29 AM,4, 0,

I will say on thing that stops it from being 5 star is of course the graphics which arent bad but also not the best. ill rate them at like an ok in graphics since you can tell what stuff looks like but is as good as something as like the walking dead saint and sinners,Apr 17 at 9:45 AM,4, 1,

There is also a few collision glitches on rock walls. And I’m a bit disappointed that you can’t check your legs like you could do in the steam next fest. And I feel the crafting is a bit weird, as of writing this I’m still not fully sure how to craft.

Your feedback will be an important part of improving those aspect of the game in future patches. 
In case of smooth turning:  we belive that the option you are looking for is already in the game! Just go to the Options in Main Menu or Pause menu -> VR Rotation -> and set the ""Rotation"" setting to ""Free"". After that, you will be able to adjust rotation speed with a ""Speed"" slider.

However, the lack of thought put into the save system is a real negative for me. The fact you cant just exit the game and restart in the same place is terrible. Also, the tutorial does not tell you how to save the game, in fact, it leads you into a game style that means you won't discover how to save for quite some time. 
I try to play games without looking at walkthroughs or guides as that spoils it for me, but after losing 4hrs of gameplay I was forced to look it up and that lead me to write this review.

If i have 7 bananas and im throwing them away the back pack will keep going back to the first inventory screen and ill have to scroll back through. Also wish you didnt have to click a button to scroll through items. Would be better if i could just push the arrows with a finger instead as it breaks immersion for me.  Still a very fun game though.

I can barely get through 1 day without ether starving or getting poisoned by something and when I do it gives you little to no help on how to stop it. 

And when your starving it’s so hard to find and gather food that will actually fill you up. And just when you’ve finally filled up a little bit and get back to the task you’re hunger will just drop again and then your stuck in that same  cycle of finding, catching, eating food and not getting round to playing the actual game. If that makes sense. 

This game is really not for beginners but yet again this could just be me being trash at VR games.",Apr 9 at 7:17 AM,4, 0,"Hello! You're right - the game can be difficult.

I wouldnt play such a game as pancake version. But in VR its fantastic. You really get the feeling to be on vacation in the rainforest. Making things feels great with the quest controllers. It feels realistic without the endurance and effort it would take in real life. It is so far a great experience for me. The first of its kind. That doesnt mean that the game is perfect (yet). It still feels like a pancake game converted to VR (what it is). By example the narratieve of dialogues dont feel optimized for VR. There is also some stuttering during play. It doesnt kill the experience but it is noticable. So there is room for further improvement.Therefore I give it 4 stars.,Apr 8 at 3:51 PM,4, 1,"Hello!

2022-05-27 22:06:47.114173,BuzzTheAmbassador,Green Hell performs well.,"I love survival games, and I can’t get enough. When I heard Green Hell was coming to the Quest, I was hyped.

I’d like to give a huge shoutout to Incuvo Games for providing me with a copy of Green Hell VR, I will have a video up on the game soon. Review will be updated. 

Performance wise, it’s okay. During recording, it has stutters and some screen tearing, but nothing unplayable or game breaking.

Graphics wise, I am very impressed. This is basically Nintendo Switch graphics bumped up 1.5x, and I’m happy with it. I can’t believe a mobile platform like this can run such a game.

Controls wise, they’re fine. They aren’t too bad or confusing. You can figure them out within an hour of playtime.

The real tricky part is when you start to actually survive. You get a little tutorial at the start of story mode, but after that, you are on your own. You have to craft, hunt, and do anything to survive. Eating mushrooms, avoiding snakes, spiders, anything. And it works super dang well.

For 29.99$ you get one hell of a bang for your buck with a full story mode, and a survival mode where you can try your skills and survive for as long as possible.

If you are hardcore, and love survival games, pick this up. It’s a no brainer.",Apr 8 at 12:51 PM,4, 1,"We love survival games as well, that's why we wanted to develop one of our own :) Thanks for the shoutout and review, we appreciate the feedback! We really tried hard to push the Quest 2 limitations, especially when it comes to graphics, to the platform's limits. The game is very much trial and error so the more you play the more you know, but we will be working on improving the new player experience for sure :) Stay tuned for future patches!"
2022-05-27 22:06:49.172991,Mr_Person,Great game,"Gameplay is good, I imagine once co-op comes out it will be incredible. The graphics are good for quest but not reactive (trees don’t show chop marks, bushes don’t move when you walk through them). I know that this is a limitation for the quest. The PC demo had extraordinary graphics, however I feel that it in unfair to compare them. There are a few issues that I have noticed, some textures don’t render (one of the fishes drop an invisible corpse) and the grabbing system feels unnatural. A recommendation I have is to increase the lenience of the distanced grab, and have the option to disable it in favour of grabbing it with your hand. One last thing, the animals spawn so frequently, I felt like there was an infinite swarm of them at my base. It would be nice if the delay between spawns or if there was system to detect if they are consistently killed at a certain area and stop them from spawning there.

For PCVR users, this is a good game with okay graphics.
For Quest users, this is a good game with great graphics.",Apr 8 at 9:28 AM,4, 1,"Thank you for your feedback and, rest assured, co-op is coming :D We will be working on making the world even more realistic and interactive.

I don’t understand why these weren’t fixed before the release, paying $30 for a game that you feel is going to be a fun long lasting survival game is very laggy and some bugs, I saw another review about a scorpion problem and the game shows no tutorial, no real settings for things people need to adjust to be able to play the game like height. when you are sitting the height does not adjust or can be adjusted to a standing height you are the height of where your oculus is and lots of things that you have to move around lots to grab and move that you can’t do while sitting down so the sitting function is useless. this is a really good game with a good idea, good potential, and great marketing lol. I might return this or something and buy it once these things are fixed and the gameplay is improved but I might not.
 ps: i’m really looking forward to the progress this game is going to go through throughout the time it’s on the store",Apr 8 at 4:50 PM,3, 1,"Hello there, thanks for your review. 
In case of the bugs, we want you to know that patch is on the way. To the height problems, here are some tips for you: 
1. Make sure that your floor level and Guardian are set up right. 
2. Make sure that your (in-game) position setting is set to a corresponding one (sitting or standing).
3. While in the game - hold the oculus button located on the right controller to reset your character height. 
4*. in sitting mode - crouching (mapped on the press of the thumbstick) might be a great help for picking up an object at your feet - that's some sort of the equivalent of bending down in a standing position. 
Please give it a try and let us know if it helps."
