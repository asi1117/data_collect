2022-05-27 21:23:03.966234,KarmaMole,Mediocre Low-Effort Port!,"Considering how long ago BlazeRush came out on PCVR, we'd expect a lot more from a Quest port in 2022, especially when an older Quest game, Mini Motor Racing X, offers so much more. It's hard to believe the developers took a look at what's already available before releasing this port. The menus look like they're from the 1980s, but my biggest gripe is the absolute lack of camera and control settings - that is just unforgivable. Half the time you're racing towards your own view, so you can't see where you're going. If you want to watch our first impressions video, search YouTube for 6DOF Reviews! Very disappointing!

Edit: I appreciate the dev's response, and really hope they consider adding some camera options and some extra steering options. MMRX allows an in-car camera, a follow camera, a fixed camera, and several angles of top-down camera, and it also has (at least) three steering options.",14 days ago,3, 31,Thank you for your feedback.

 SEARCH ‘GAMERTAG VR’ ON YOUTUBE👌

I was a massive fan of Micro Machines back in the day and now it’s come to quest I’m super happy with this port. 8 player online or 4 players local and the top down view is cool. If your looking a fun arcades style VR racer you can’t really go wrong with this",15 days ago,4, 20,Thank you for your feedback. We are glad that you liked our game
2022-05-27 21:23:08.044028,SchemingDemons,"Addictive, Brutal Deathrace!","Childhood me would’ve dropped so many quarters into an arcade machine like this that I can’t help but feel like I’m getting away with theft at this price point!  I just want to keep playing.  If you like the look of the game, you’ll love playing it.  Great weapons, great vehicles, great tracks, great game.  I adamantly disagree with the suggestion that this game should have other view options.  This is a particular type of racer that requires this camera angle.  Anything else wouldn’t be practical.  Do yourself a favor and buy this, you’ll be happy you did.

EDIT:  The only thing this game needs is a replay camera.  I’ve had so many amazing last second wins and out maneuvers that having the ability to watch them again on a replay cam would be most appreciated!",11 days ago,5, 7,Thank you for your feedback!
2022-05-27 21:23:10.097557,GTHobbes,Awesome game,"I too almost didn’t buy this because of the 6Dof review but then pulled the trigger based on the user reviews I’d seen here.  Great game.  As a fan of mini moto racing, this is Exactly the game I’ve been looking for.  It’s new, different, great looking and a whole lot of fun with a bunch of content.  Feels like a steal at this price, too.  A+",13 days ago,5, 7,Thanks for the feedback. We are glad that you liked it
2022-05-27 21:23:12.139010,Nerdburglar,A blast to play!,"This game is like Anki Overdrive or toy cars come to life. For $15 your getting a pretty fair amount of content and when you include just how endlessly replayable it is, the game feels almost like a steal! It’s just so much fun!!! I really wish the online was more popular though. It’s a shame this isn’t getting much attention because it’s really a blast! I’m very confused by the 6DOF review here because this game is awesome! It may feel a little bit dated, but through and through, the game is an utter blast to play!!",14 days ago,5, 6,Thanks. We are very pleased
2022-05-27 21:23:16.321911,Radiorunt,Great Game,This is a great game and highly recommended.   You will not be disappointed with it.  I used to own this on the GO and PCVR and it looks better and plays better then the PCVR version.  If you have never played Blaze Rush and you must pick this up.,14 days ago,5, 11,Thank you for your feedback. Thank you for loving our game!
2022-05-27 21:23:18.375173,Skyhawk613,Brilliant!,"Update: 
Developer's please take note;

* Rocketroll mode; in some vehicles the screen goes white when shooting the missile and needs to be fixed please.

* The Blaserush banner show's  black and blocky in the left eye in the menu screen room.

All I suppose will be fixed in an update soon hopefully.



Great old school racing & carnage fun!
Love it the new Star Trek track!
 Five stars from me!

2022-05-27 21:23:20.420278,coralfields,Just fun.,"Yeah, the graphics are not the best available on Quest and perhaps the port would have benefited from some additional care, but this is just so much fun, especially in multiplayer with friends. I don't think every VR game should implement the first person view, in fact the VR effect here is simple but super effective and makes the game so comfortable.
If you like some straightforward old school multiplayer arcade racing game this is the best option in my opinion.

P.S. Devs please consider to release it in the Oculus PC store too with crossplatform play, we played it among friends for months and now the ones with the Rift are cut off with this new version.",12 days ago,5, 3,Thank you for your feedback. We will discuss your request with the developers
2022-05-27 21:23:22.482623,stormshadow612,Great overhead combat racer,"Pros:
Visuals
Handling
Weapons 
Tracks 

Cons:
No voice/player chat

No camera options to zoom in and out 

Not being able to hear players reactions in the game is disappointing.  Not having that is not understandable.  Hopefully there’s Party Chat at least. So you can talk to friends when playing.  
The camera is too close to your face. It’s hard to tell what’s in front of you. When the cars are coming at you. Needs to be zoomed out a little more. 
Having Hazards on the track would make the game more fun and tense. Like spikes popping up or tornadoes
or slime areas or Ice patch’s.   
We need more nite time races. The weapon effects look incredible at nite. 
The game is awesome otherwise. 
5 stars once they add voice chat. 

We at least need party chat. If it’s not available. So we can talk to friends while playing.    A game like this needs this option. There’s no excuse not to",11 hours ago,4, 3,Thanks for the feedback. We will think about voice chat
2022-05-27 21:23:24.526213,Zedisnotdead,Lots of fun,I almost didn't pick this up because of the 6dof review ....I am also not sure why they gave it such a poor review. Each and to there own I guess but I for 1 am having a blast. Good job devs,13 days ago,4, 5,Thanks!
2022-05-27 21:23:28.678556,Trust,Tiny toy cars that feel real. Always fun,"Blaze Rush has several novel design choices that make it my *favorite* top down racer of all time.

Simple controls with gameplay depth that rewards skill development.
Trailing cars are warped back to the pack. The leader never gets so far ahead that they feel safe, and the pack isn't so far behind that they feel discouraged. 
Consistent, fun physics. Weapons and collisions knock cars around, they don't blow them up. This means being effective means not just hitting, but hitting at the right time. 

Visually designed with VR in mind. 
Trailing particle effects and constant vehicle physics animations have depth and responsiveness that truly delivers on the  feeling of 'tiny toy cars, but real' 

There are a lot of racers on the market, but none of them are as easy to pick up, or as hard to put down as Blaze Rush.",7 days ago,5, 1,Thank you for your feedback. We are glad that you liked the game
2022-05-27 21:23:30.711085,Bonly,Small Changes for Big Difference!,"It pains me to give this game 3 stars, as It is easily a 4 or 5 star game.  

I have promoted this game to my group, and 5 other people have purchased it.

 We all love the game. I looks good. It's fun. It is easy to pick up and play, but there is a skill set that is worth working on. 

The Fottball is a lost leader as it is not featured in the promotion of this game, but is most people's favorite that I know.

The game itself is def worth the money! 

Now for the issues. 

Since this is a party game, it is unconscionable to not have a way to Chat with the people you meet, and are playing with, in game. For friends, we party up in Oculus Chat, but when we are playing, people join and sometimes we don't even know. 

This makes no sense to me. If I didn't have people to  play with, and purchased this to play myself and meet people in game, I would not play much at all. 

Also, there is a leader board for Adventure, and Star Track, but I do not see one for Party Tournaments?

Another missed opportunity for competition, as people care more about their online accumulated numbers than the campaigns.....

Also, it would be nice to have the cars labeled somehow so you know who you are driving against az well.

Once the community features are added, this will certainly be 5 stars.

Thanks!

2022-05-27 21:23:32.751418,pilotequest,Fantastic !!!,"Don't listen Bad review about this game, try it and if you don't like it ask a refund. This game is just pretty fun, always in action and challenging. Missions is so cool, the game is well done with lot of details and animation, graphics is ok for Quest.
My only grip is the game is not always smooth, i didn't seen difference with 120hz on. The camera is perfect for me always moving. I'm so glad with game and i hope update for future",9 days ago,4, 1,Thank you for your feedback. We'll see what the problem might be
2022-05-27 21:23:34.797146,WoodSnake557,Classic Game  on Quest,I Give 5 Stars  One of the Best Games on Vr  that's a Classic Game when on PC the  Controls are Easy intuitive to use when Controlling the Vehicles so Many Different Cool Weapons to Pick up and Graphics are Amazing as Identical as it was on the PC Version  Recommend this Game to Everyone 👍,An hour ago,5, 0,Thank you for your feedback and appreciation!
2022-05-27 21:23:36.833876,The_VR_Grid,"Been there, done that.","As far as top-down racers go, BlazeRush: Star Track is acceptable, but outside of the focus on weapons over racing, really does little to make it truly stand out, especially when you compare it to Mini Moto Racing X, which offers up more tracks, vehicles, views, upgrades, and content overall.  It’s not bad, but it also starts to feel quite samey despite the new weapons and courses introduced and when you factor in the seemingly dead multiplayer element, it’s one of those games that’s fun to play for a bit, but I was bored long before I finished all the races.

2022-05-27 21:23:53.392278,Master.DJW,My first impressions-Arcade Perfection!,"I was sooo hesitant to purchase this game because of some of the cry baby reviews... especially 6DOf reviews. (Well they did get the worst reviewer on their team to do the first impressions video) Always sounds depressed and bored. I have NO ISSUES with the controls or camera and I can see every turn that’s coming up. The controls are tight asf! This game gave me that same feeling as a 10yr old child when I first rented/played “Rock n Roll Racing” for the Mega Drive. Instantly fell in love! This game is obviously miles better, except RnRR had a funny announcer with classic cool music that suited the whole theme n style of the game. This is like going back in time as a kid but only in VR and it’s like you’re actually playing with the miniature toy cars. The nostalgia is high on this one for me.

The flat screen videos of this game do it no justice. The 3D effect on this game is mind blowing, just like Moss but only with cars (SO CUTE!) just wanna reach in an pick them up. The ancient ruin stages actually reminds me of Moss. I love 3rd person in VR, it’s way better than in 1st person to me. Not everything has to be seen through the eyes in VR. Mix it up a lil.

This review is based on only 1hr 25mins of play.  I understand if you don’t want to give it 5 stars if you’ve played the PCVR version but I’ve never heard of this game until it came onto the store out of nowhere. Honestly my favourite purchase of the year so far. Does this game have any negatives? I don’t know as of yet but for now my only nitpick would be that there’s no rain sound effects (love rain sound)... AND, I know this will eventually give me stick drift because I will not be putting this down anytime soon. 

Please keep implementing new ideas, updates and TLC. I want this game to thrive and conquer. 

I’ll update once I’ve played A-LOT more.... 

Go now and buy this amazing game and let out your inner child. 10/10 MUST BUY!",8 days ago,5, 4,Thank you so much for such a great review! We are very pleased that you liked our game.
2022-05-27 21:23:55.435820,ToxicFpV,What a blast,This game really is a simple game. But it is sooo much fun. Ai is competitive but not so hard that you can't win. But you won't always win.  Kind of reminds me of rock n roll racing from super Nintendo days.,14 days ago,5, 4,Thank you for your feedback!
2022-05-27 21:23:57.506045,jwb1971,Addictive vehicle mayhem!,"This game is so much fun! You can play seated so it’s a nice break if you’re tired of standing all the time in VR. Fun physics, awesome wrecks and explosions, tons of game modes - King of the Hill, Death Race (a giant crusher chases the racers and picks off the stragglers one by one), even a “football” mode - which I’m terrible at (hah) but is still chaotic and fun. 

While this is a port of the PC VR game it has such a satisfying game loop that you’ll find yourself playing for hours!

Just get this game! It’s great, whacky racing and combat with awesome physics and effects! What more could you want??",3 days ago,5, 0,Thank you so much for the wonderful review!
