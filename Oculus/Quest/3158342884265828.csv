2022-05-27 22:22:30.235347,calforb,Great experience,"Fantastic to see this move from app lab to official store.

There are some fantastic experiences in this app to help with all varieties of mind. 

My personal favourite is the Awe section. I’m really hoping more content comes along for this because it’s a wonder to experience. 

Great work and looking forward to seeing what develops now the app is in the official store!",Apr 8 at 6:06 AM,4, 92,"Hey @calforb, 
Great to hear you're enjoying Liminal! We plan on releasing new experiences within the coming weeks. Stay tuned!"
2022-05-27 22:22:32.274981,EtherealDave,Liminal Is Unlike Anything Else,"I used Liminal for the first time last week and I was really impressed with the app overall. There is nothing else quite like it, and the variety of their offerings range from extremely meditative, to blissfully fun.

Personally, I like that they ask for a ""reading"" of your mood prior and post experience. I think that this is important information to collect in order to create and curate the best content possible.

I'll be coming back frequently to this app, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves over time!",Apr 17 at 12:50 AM,5, 25,Hey EtherealDave! Thanks for your feedback! We are always excited to hear how Liminal has helped users improve their mood and mindset. Make sure to come back each week to explore new experiences!

They responded pretty quick and stayed in contact with me until the problem was resolved.  The app itself seems pretty well thought out. It has lab activities plus stuff for meditation.  Worth giving it a try.  It's definitely relaxing.",Apr 9 at 9:35 AM,4, 24,"Hi skippy-01

2022-05-27 22:22:36.416663,LikeBooms,Revised review and rating,"So originally I had an issue connecting to the servers when I initially downloaded it. But devs were quick to act and address my issue. They informed me that a high volume of users trying to access the network was likely the culprit. So I kept it around, as I said I would and days later was able to play. The experience itself was stimulating, tantalizing even at times. Some of the lab content seemed grueling to me, to be honest. But the energizing experiences did indeed get me a little hype, especially the ones involving speed. Overall I think it's a decent app, you can tell that much thought goes into the experiences. Keep up the good work devs and thank you for your speedy response.",Apr 12 at 9:19 PM,4, 21,"Hi LikeBooms

2022-05-27 22:22:38.469315,Canceledhusky688,Great but I want my body,This app is great it helps me feel more calm and really does what it says but my one complaint is I want an avatar in it because it’s distracting and disconcerting when I look down at my self and see nothing. One more minor complaint is in the room of rain or whatever it’s called there are cups of coffe or hot Chocolate but you can’t pick them up but for me having the ability to pick it up would an addition to the over all feelings of calm,Apr 18 at 1:31 PM,3, 13,"Thanks for your feedback! And we enjoyed reading your suggestions. As new experiences are released every week, we recommend you come back and try Liminal in the future!"
2022-05-27 22:22:42.677870,NarutoUzumaki2022,Best experience ever had in VR,"I recommend this to anyone who suffers from stress,anxiety, panic attacks the experiences in this are amazing and so calming my favorite is the garden I could physically sit down and just look at the flowers and listen to the birds singing I wasn't even in there for the whole 4 minutes before I felt so calm and relaxed I highly recommend to EVERYONE.",Apr 26 at 7:54 AM,5, 6,"Wow thanks for your feedback!!! We are so happy you have found the calming experiences to ease stress and panic attacks. Drawing on research in the fields of neuroscience and psychology, the Liminal Platform aims to empower people to choose how they'd like to feel and perform. Living with anxiety can be crippling so we hope you continue exploring more new experiences on Liminal and let us know what you think!"
2022-05-27 22:22:44.723970,gwensparkle,An enjoyable range of experiences!,"Update:  There is now an updated version with a few changes.  There are now 4 categories (3 mood + lab).  The experiences don't change quite as often as I thought, but the ones that are there are well worth revisiting.  Neither change would cause me to revise my rating.

Original:  This is more than just a daily meditation app. Each time you log in, you have a choice of five mood categories, each with the choice of several experiences. Each experience is unique, more so because they are developed by a variety of different developers. You might be relaxing in a spa tub looking out on a gentle rain, or blasting off to escape Earth's gravity, or trekking around desert sands, or anything else a developer can imagine.

All the experiences have the goal to modify or enhance your mood and many of the individual experiences do that quite successfully. The app is free and in exchange you are helping mood research by rating your before and after moods to help gauge the effect of each experience on individuals. I've found a side benefit has been to help me be more aware of my own moods and how I can change them.

The selection of available experiences changes every several days. One nice feature is that you are able to save your favorites and keep them available. The app is great to access for a short break as most of the experiences are two to five minutes. Some of the relaxation experiences also give you a choice for a longer period of time.

Liminal is an experience that I can easily recommend!",Apr 12 at 12:01 AM,5, 11,Hey gwensparkle! We are glad to hear you are enjoying your experience on the Liminal Platform so far. It's also awesome to hear that you've found the platform to help you personally with being aware of your mood and how you can alter it.
2022-05-27 22:22:46.761455,Kristin525,Excellent customer service,"UPDATED REVIEW: I wrote the review below and then reached out to the developers about the technical difficulties I was experiencing. They were super helpful and not only solved the problem, but also gave me free credits to compensate for the temporary difficulty. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I really enjoy this app and use it primarily to meditate. I love that each week there are different experiences to try. I would give it five stars except for two things: first, there aren't a lot of ways to earn credits to ""favorite"" an experience and not lose access to it after a week; and second, the experiences I unlocked for 28 days are now locked again even though it's only been a week (I assume this is a glitch). I would gladly pay for credits, but that isn't an option at the moment.",Apr 29 at 2:23 PM,5, 5,"Hi Kristin525 thanks for your feedback! Just wanting to double checking if you are referring to the free rotation of experiences that unlock each week? 

If you are still unsure about this, feel free to contact support@liminalvr.com and we can assist you further."
2022-05-27 22:22:48.846695,Waterfall,Calming,I have used this periodically since I downloaded from App Lab last summer. I have to say I LOVE the Calm section- Specifically Spa and Primal Rain. Those two alone are worth it to me as i found them incredibly relaxing and help me decompress!,Apr 8 at 1:20 PM,5, 14,"Hey gschizzy2021, so glad to hear you are enjoying your time on Liminal!

2022-05-27 22:22:50.882903,Mark-Bliss,Not impressed,"I was hoping for a game like TRIPP, sadly it was weak in comparison. If it had a one time fee I made have tried it longer but I’m not going to have a monthly subscription when I can go into Tripp and get a better experience. What little I saw was weak and monotonous.",Apr 11 at 8:37 AM,2, 6,"Sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the app this time around. The app is currently completely free, and the experiences on Liminal unlock on a weekly rotation.

2022-05-27 22:22:55.066657,stephanie.olson.12,"So far, so awesome!","First of all, this is a new app that is just coming together.  It is exciting to imagine how it has the potential to grow in the future.  I was going to get on here and talk about my favorite experience on it but this would be impossible. Every one I have done so far is unique and cool in its own way.  It is a great meditation app and stands up to comparison to other meditation apps.  However it is so much more than that. I like seeing what different teams come up with and experiencing the variety of styles.  Like all technology, VR has the ability to be a positive or a negative element in someone's life. Liminal seems to be exploring how best to have a positive effect on the human mind. Thanks! I will be interested in seeing what the premium version holds!",Apr 21 at 5:44 AM,5, 3,Woohoo! Thanks stephanie.olson.12 for your awesome review! Make sure to come back next week to try more free experiences #liminalplatform
2022-05-27 22:22:57.118548,gem217,Amazing but bit annoyed,"The app itself is absolutely amazing. However when you use your credits to unlock an experience for 28 days and then it says you have 19 days left but tries to make you unlock it again rather than let you play it is a bit annoying. Not sure if it's something I'm doing but can't see any other option. Bugs like this are frustrating

Update : thanks so much for the reply, as soon as the bug is sorted this will be a five star rating. My daughter absolutely loves it!",Apr 29 at 6:21 PM,3, 0,"Hi gem217, thanks for your feedback and apologies for any issues that may have occurred whilst using Liminal.

2022-05-27 22:23:38.531819,TheForbinProject,Much to like here,"I meditate daily and use a number of VR programs to do so.  Liminal offers some top-notch meditation experiences within the ""Calm"" arena but also has a variety of experiences including mini-games as well as some neat visual experiences that can be fairly trippy.  Currently, Liminal ""gamifies"" using the program by rewarding you with credits for each consecutive day you use the app as well as rewarding you with credits for participating in their Lab experiences.  The credits are mostly useful if you wish to ""favorite"" an experience and keep it from expiring.  In my case, I have favorited experiences that offer a meditation component.  The experiences rotate with most seeming to expire after about a week (favoriting keeps them unlocked).  I'd note that you MUST set up an account to claim credits.

There is a decent amount of content, but not enough for a commercial product.  The experiences are designed by a variety of teams so there is no real aesthetic that permeates Liminal--in that respect the experiences can be uneven in quality.  That said, many of the experiences are very well done and warrant revisiting.

I've been using Liminal since before it was available via App Lab.  It has a number of merits, but unless you commit to using it daily (and thus earning credits) you will not be able to ""favorite"" the best experiences and will have to rely on whatever is currently in rotation.  I'm interested in what will become of Liminal as currently there is no subscription model or fees involved.  If they can gather a sufficient amount of content for the variety of categories they offer (Calm, Energy, and Awe) it might be worth a purchase.  Until then, I do highly recommend not only trying it, but would also encourage people to set up an account and use it for a few days straight in order to claim credits in order to start favoriting experiences you enjoy.",Dec 15 at 6:09 AM,4, 57,

It had me logged in with my user name and chosen colored icon. I went into the lab. I tried two of the motion tests but it still said I had zero coins. I tried the prototype lab, got 100 coins. Went into the save menu to try to save one of the experiences and it said I needed to sign in. I thought I was already signed in, my user name and icon were there. I clicked on the icon with my user name and the screen froze and I had to quit the app. 

I opened the app again and saw my icon there. I clicked on it but it still asked me to sign in. When I did, it said wrong user name or password. I had just signed up and knew it was correct but clicked Forgot Password to reset it. I never got the email. I closed the app and reopened it. This time my icon was missing and the choice was to be a guest or add user. I tried to sign up again but it said it could not create my account. So I can’t log in with the account I created or create a new one with the email and user name I had originally used.

We realise that having to rate your moods before & after an experience may not be ideal for some users - however it is important for both us and users as it allows us to rate experiences based off their effectiveness, and create better experiences in the future using this feedback. It also allows users to know which are the most effective experiences at their designed goals (ie. calming), or what moods people felt after doing it - all of which helps users to make informed decisions about what experiences they want to use.

Additionally, signing in isnt necessary, however it is recommended as its completely free and gives you access to some unique features such as unlocking favourite slots, or participating in the 'Lab' for some unique and interesting experiments in VR research."
