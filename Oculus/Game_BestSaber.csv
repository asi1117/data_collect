There is a limited amount of songs, alot of which are behind pay walls. OSTV was great, but now I'm slowly becoming more and more bored. It's fine if it's behind paywalls, but add custom songs. Like, make a system where people can submit songs, and you guys verify it. Besides this, it's a good game. Still very fun, but I'm slowly getting bored, and would love to hear my favorite songs, without having to use mods, which I haven't done yet.",4月24日08:18,5,Great Game! But.....

I need beat saber to build in mods to their game so I can have fun. I have never been more disappointed at a game for not simply having custom songs. If you guys make mods built in it would make my experience much better. I gave it 1 star so they would notice this.

First of all Beat Saber is really good and lots of fun.
Also it is not a bad cardio game if you are doing it on harder levels :D

Will it come back? It was nice to play with random people together with my friends.

2022-05-24 13:43:50.452771,"I know I can't convince anybody on the Oculus app, it's extensively part of the internet and people can be quite stubborn. I promise that whenever anybody brings up this game to me, I'll make it clear exactly why it embodies the worst trends of both the music and game industries. This is an insidious piece of software down to its conceptual core.

If you're interested in my reasoning, well, look at who owns the rights to the game (Meta), custom songs, and DLC. Meta's stance is VERY hostile to custom songs, especially on their platforms (mainly Quest). How do I know they're against custom songs? They make it very difficult to use any and the three times I have, my Quest needed to be factory reset after less than a week. Custom songs ensure that smaller artists and other media in general can be part of the experience of this game; by Meta practically banning custom songs and requiring expensive & semi-glamorous contracts for paid DLC, it's denying art, culture, and community fun that they could be platforming. Meta's excuse is that custom songs would be too much of a DMCA issue but that's a moot point: YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and really any platform where art can be shared among users will have DMCA issues but Meta as a company already has systems to deal with this type of thing on their other platforms. If you don't LOVE only the mainstream artists that pay Meta's toll, you'll hate this game. If you appreciate artistic freedom, you'll probably be frustrated with what this game offers. If you care about integrity and community, this game might enrage you. If you like flailing your arms alone to generic EDM (or paying top $ to flail your arms alone to a handful of celebrities) then I've found the perfect waste of your time, money, and energy.

The fact that Pavlov Shack has a lower rating than this is a travesty. I assume a lot of those reviews must be salt anticipating an update, people who didnt play long enough to realize the different game modes and what you can do on different maps, and people who never played more recent updates. I wouldn't say this for the Steam version or any of the versions a few years ago before Meta basically took charge of this game. This Quest version as of 2022 though? The worst iteration I've played yet.",4天前,1,Artistically offensive

2022-05-24 13:44:00.643758,"Okay, starting off with the basic things. This game is super fun and addicting. It’s also a bit of a workout because you have either lean to the left or right, or squat/duck down. Like seriously, it’s a exercise game, just with lightsabers. 

I’ve seen so many people play this and, I thought it seemed pretty fun. Although, I can’t seem to figure out how their able to show their bodies…? (If you don’t know what I’m talking about, I mean the videos that show the peoples bodies and how they move to hit the best squares.) 

But, besides that, this game is super fun to play when you’re bored! I enjoy the music that they use, along with the way you can change a few things to your own liking! If I hate to rate this game more than 5 stars, this game would get 20 stars from me.

SONG PACK REQUESTS: 1) Nicki Minaj. Now, look. I know there are kids playing this game and such but, Nicki’s songs would fit! Just add both clean and not clean versions so there’s no argument. 2) Rihanna. Okay-okay. Don’t get me wrong on this but, Rihanna’s music has a few good and bad songs. But her bass in her music hits HARD. For example the song “Pour it Up”. Like Nicki Minaj’s songs, add clean and not clean versions. 3) Beyoncè. I’ve always loved the Queen B’s songs since I was 8 yrs old, and her music is exceptional. But, maybe just add a few since she talks about uh… “inappropriate” topics sometimes.
 
That’s all I have to say about this game. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Have a wonderful day/night/noon/evening! :)

(Also yes, I know it has a warning at the beginning of the game but, I’m gonna say it anyways. If you have photosensitive epilepsy, it would be best to stay away from this game and check out a different one. This game has quite a few flashing lights, along with some bright ones.

I only gave it 8.5 because sometimes the songs you are given free get boring..

2022-05-24 13:44:31.263991,"Pick this game up now! It’s great and will get you playing for hours. The global leaderboard system is great and the ability to play with others is awesome! 

However, many music packs are locked behind paywalls and honestly it feels like such a waste of money when people can just mod the game if they really want. 

My proposal is that you make the vibrant bustling modding community a part of the normal beatsaber community. Instead of paying for music packs, I’d spend money on buying things like custom sabers and cool effects (for example a fire trail coming out my sabers). This game has so much potential with customisation… Make all songs free and have people import custom songs, however make users pay for added cosmetics. Not saying steal from other games but you could make more money with let’s say a “beat pass” or some sort of item shop instead of making people buy songs they could get for free in the modded variant of the game.",13天前,5,"Amazing game, however…"

2022-05-24 13:44:31.311868,"Beat Saber is one of if not my favorite vr game. It is great and it has a lot but I want the to add two things or three I guess. I don’t know if the developers are reading this or not but if they are please consider these ideas. 1. Different sabers. Now the default sabers are great but what if we could get different ones, like have you seen the ones you can get with mods, they look great now how we obtain them is in two. 2. A store. Now with the store we could buy different items like sabers from idea 1 and avatar items for online. We can get money to buy things by buying it with IRL money or depending on the difficulty, mods, and score we could get more or less money. 3. A specific song pack. I really want a Metallica song pack or just some sort of heavy metal song pack that has at least one or two Metallica songs.

2022-05-24 13:44:51.723309,"I love this game. It’s amazing and SO FUN. I wish I could give it five stars, but there are some things that I have started to notice and it’s been starting to get more and more annoying over time. It’s great to play on the easy modes, but over time as you start to progress and try to do the expert or expert plus stages it gets significantly more annoying and harder to play. Not because it’s hard but because there are some issues like: controllers spazzing out in the game and completely flying off the map, controllers entirely not registering in the game, the game not registering the sabers randomly throughout the song and disappearing, causing you to miss notes that you know you wouldn’t have missed, and some songs have notes that are way too high for you to even reach. You have to actually stretch, and that’s hard because I’m already short as it is. I know it’s the game specifically having these issues because playing on others games I NEVER have controller issues. And every other game registers my controllers just fine. But as soon as I play this game and move around a lot the game glitches out. ALSO, the game has a hard time registering the controllers especially when you cross your hands/arms for some notes, and takes a while to go back to normal causing you to miss even more notes. My room is nicely lit, not too bright and I have enough space to move around. I know it’s not my surroundings that causes these issues. And even the other games work fine with my surroundings and the lighting. FIX THESE ISSUES.  I know I’m not the only one out there who has to deal with this. I really want to enjoy the game without my controllers disappearing and ruining my perfect streaks. 

Other than that I enjoy most of the packs and the songs.",3天前,4,Could be better….
2022-05-24 13:44:51.737357,"I’ve been playing beat saber, to put it lightly, way too much.

And I’ve been playing since pretty much day one. So I can make opinions with confidence.

The game is amazing, unlike any other beat game out there. Pistol whip, and other beat games are still good, but let’s be serious, beat saber’s the best.

So, what makes it so great?

The songs is what gets everyone. They are great. You have 100’s of free songs too choose from, and once you feel done with that, you have the DLC’s!

There are literally hundreds of songs.

And once you finish that, you can always just install mods and play some ranked!

Now, as a former holder of top 8k in the world in beat saber, I must say, it’s a good game, and there is something for everyone difficulty.

Yes, It’s not a game for everyone, but even my friend with epilepsy plays the game for 30 minutes a day. 

And if he was willing to do that, it means it’s a good game.

Trust me, the money you put in to buy it, will not be wasted.

Something about the update messed that up. I disconnected my Bluetooth headphones and it worked perfectly. It’s annoying not being able to use my headphones, but I’m happy to be playing again and hopefully they’ll fix the issue sooner rather than later.


I’ve had my quest 2 headset for about a month now and I have loved playing Beat Saber. It was the first game I bought, but since the update they did last week I have not been able to play it at all. Every time I try playing I’ll get the first couple of notes and then the whole thing just freezes up. The music keeps playlist my but that’s it. I’ve tried restarting the e headset. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the game. I did a factory reset. Nothing works!! All of my other games work just fine so I don’t see how it could be the headset itself. It’s really frustrating paying for a game and paying for some of the song packs and not even being able to play. If you’d asked me a week and a half ago I would have had nothing but good things to say, but after not being able to play for over a week I don’t even want to rate it.",3月18日23:02,4,Loved it until the update..

I would gladly pay $2 - $5 per songs for old songs that I love or have already paid for on my music collection. I don’t want ANY NEW songs. Just give me ones I already know. I don’t need the new Timberland songs.  I’d rather pay for some of his old ones. Hell, go back to the 80’s, 90’s, or early 2000’s songs if u have too. Or one hit wonders. I’m sure they would like a $1 or $3 per download. There was already many levels made with hundreds of songs and it was killed by greed. And they were all free.  Why not take some of those levels, offer to share payment with the performing artists and let the downloads begin. The people who made the levels didn’t ask for any money, so u don’t need to pay them for they work. Just touch up the levels to Oculus standards. Waiting months and months for new music packs of songs I never heard and don’t like are ridiculous.  Give me music I already know and then this would be a great 5 star game.  Until then wait until it goes down to $5 or $10.  Not worth any thing more for playing the same unknown music. 11-17-20 update. The lack of diversity in the music is regrettable.

Secondly, let online players choose a dlc pack to create a multiplayer lobby. So instead of all or built in we can narrow our search for the exact dlc we want to play with random people with.

 Thirdly add a dlc only menu to remove OST trolls.  I don't like that I own every song and select all songs in multiplayer to be stuck playing OST 4 and 5 songs. Force people with no dlc to play in the non dlc lobby. Something needs to be done about match making.

2022-05-24 13:45:42.804265,"So I bought BeatSaber awhile back and I was so happy I played a few songs but A few days after it gets so boring like you start to realize that it was a waste of money then another few days it's fun and repeat but this game just ends up not being fun at all anymore it costs you money for a song which I think is worse than Spotify 
( that's my opinion though) but you can't mod it really at all on the Oculus Quest 1&2 so that makes it more only on PC and I don't have a good enough computer to mod it so the game is basically trash and the only people that want or play beatsaber is either 9 or 10 year olds that complain to their moms if they don't get a 20 dollar hat in gorrila tag. So when you stop playing the game you will realize that's it's not that's intense it's more of a starter game but $30 FOR A STARTER GAME that's more intense than the game itself $15 would be more reasonable than $30 but that's how it is.",9天前,3,"Fun then boring, then Repeat, then stop"

You’re limited to a certain amount of songs and you have to buy a songs and packs if you want more. The prices for these packs are… okay- They could be better. But it’s worth it:) At least, it’s worth it for maybe… a month? You could get easily bored if you don’t try to keep the game fresh in your mind. 

But, there’s a lot of good things about this game! You can go online and play songs with other people. I just wish there was either a voice chat or a type chat. Both would be nice. Also, whenever you really get into a song and enjoy it, it’s a great feeling. It’s fun!

My solution is to jog and hop in place while playing. I play at expert level for fun and use hard level for working out. For pure work outs beat saber's main competition is supernatural which has cool graphics but is not as fun. If beat saber was smart they would come out with a 10 song music pack with easier arm stuff (less cross overs etc) and harder legs (more barriers with faster transitions side to side and up and down) This would totally capture the pure work out market!

I’ve had the months now and can beat expert+ on most songs. But when I tried this it was like I said, a child was mapping the songs. You have to use all of your arm strength for each note.

Expert plus levels were a funny joke to watch when I got started but now it's all I play. 

My only critique is I wish there were more songs available for the price of the game compared to other similar music/rythm games like Just Dance or Guitar Hero or even Tap Tap Revolution. Even if only available as add-ons I shouldn't have to mod the game to get more than a few popular songs or packs.",4月19日15:01,5,Absolutely addicting!

For the custom sabers I think there should be a currency system that you can use to buy new sabers. You could either; buy the currency or beat songs to obtain some. I think that the range for how expensive the sabers are should be anywhere from 250-2500 credits. I also think that the amount of currency you get from the songs should vary how well you do (The lowest would be 5 while the highest 10 or 15).

It’s clear when a block didnt register, you see your sword swing directly through it at the arrow, feel a little vibration but it stutters for a moment and tells you you missed, ruining what rhythm you had going at the time.

2022-05-24 13:48:06.156290,"I have been playing Beat Saber for about 6 months now and I have been absolutely loving it. I'd always struggled to get into exercise as it's really dull going to a gym to get your workout or buying home equipment that eventually gathers dust. Beat Saber is the one consistent form of exercise that I have stuck with and it's showing! 

So what keeps me coming back! Well the game play is really fun and really gets you moving around. It's like fruit ninja on LSD with bangin choons that sucks you in and turns you into a flailing psychopath which is a great show for the neighbours when you forget to close the curtains. 👀

Most of the song packs are great and has a nice variation of genres from indie bands like Imagine dragons, Pop Punk like Green day and Fall out Boy then lots of more dancey and electro stuff which is awesome if you are feeling that sort of vibe. 

If you want to have fun and work out at the same time this is the game for you! 

-------------Feedback For Devs---------------
- Would be awesome to have a playlist feature so I can add songs from different song packs together. I know there is the heart feature but if I am feeling a more Rocky genre sort of day would be nice to jump straight into my playlist for it. 

- Would be nice to have the ribbon and arc notes as an optional feature as some of the Fall Out Boy songs recently released are great songs but don't feel the best to play with the ribbons. 
Just to add these new note types can be hella fun to play just would be nice to disable on occassion if you have Beat Sabered too hard and your arms are too rekt to keep consistantly held in the air. 

- Would be nice to have access to custom songs without being hooked up to a PC. 

- Occassionally I have noticed that notes will seem to miss whenever I play online but never seems to happen in singleplayer. Could be due to net speed but haven't noticed any issues on other games. Have tried cleaning the cameras, adjusting the lighting in the room, making sure controllers are fully charged etc but doesn't seem to help.",4月7日07:32,5,Burning Calories One Block at a time! 🔥

I slash the first note and the game freezes. The music plays on but, screen is frozen. I Uninstalled it and reinstalled same problem. I reset my quest 2 no luck. I have only had this headset 2 weeks or so and it's a 256g so it's got lots of room a patch needs to be released soon. Otherwise I'll only be using this unit for movies.

Update Some how I got this fixed on my own. I  played a song through in zen mode then I played the same song without hitting the note blocks for a game over then I restarted the song and it played just fine. I was on stationary mode at first, but I tried this method  with the room boundaries on and it worked just fine. Yes it's a little hassle to run the song to get game over first then get to play it for real but at least I get to play. Will update if steps become unnecessary.

**NOTE** To the developers: I also recommend that you rework the tracking for short players, ie, people shorter than 5 foot.  I cannot play the Expert+ games without jumping.

My warning is about the available-for-purchase in game music packs. They DO NOT share to all accounts on the device. For example, if your three kids all want the BTS music pack on their accounts, you will be forced to buy it three times. This is, simply put, a greedy money grab.

You get people to buy the music packs through the popularity of the artists, and so Beat Games gets revenue, you get an amazing experience of songs in new ways you couldn’t even imagine.

Listening to the song is one thing, but actually feeling the song is another. It’s an amazing concept that is executed very well. This is exactly what Beat Saber needs.

You need to stretch before playing though, as the shoulders, arms and wrists will be highly solicited.
For me, Beat Saber is like entering a new realm of reality in which I can vibe to a rythm and sweat like crazy !
You need at least a meter sqare to play I would say, but you won’t be able to play some game modes without at least a 1.5m square, like 360 mode, where the level goes all around you and you often end up backwards from where you began.
To wrap it up, I’d say Beat Saber is definitely THE experience everyone should get on Quest, as it’s probably the game that has one of the best replayability, because every level has a lot of difficulties and game modes, and the developers are always adding new content (OST 4 is awesome, Ludicrous+ in expert+ is just a thrill).
I’ve been playing Beat Saber daily for 2 months and a half now !

Update: it’s been over a year, I don’t play it as often anymore but still my favorite VR game, with and without mods. Plus OST 5 is out of this world, it’s wonderful to have got all these creators which were already known in beat saber through mods !",3月31日17:38,5,My quest 2 is a Beat Saber machine

2022-05-24 13:49:28.107616,"Hugely addictive game that I keep coming back to. That said, the most recent ""developments"" to the game leave a lot to be desired. Not a big fan of chain notes but I can live with them. The bigger issue is the completely pointless arc notes. They have no scoring value, are distracting, vibrate unnecessarily (which can't be turned off in settings unless you turn off all vibration), and are frankly patronising.

2022-05-24 13:49:58.832408,"So if everybody could find this helpful so the developers see this that will be great!

I think there should be a built in mod loader or something, I love beat saber but sometimes the songs get boring and I would like new songs that aren’t usually there! So if we could get a built in mod loader where we can somehow get mods without pc that would be awesome!

Second: If we cannot do a mod loader I have some great ideas for DLC (Add On), Subnautica: Those songs are amazing one of my favorites being Abandon Ship, I have a lot of other ideas but I. Ant list them all so if we can get some more Add Ons if we can’t get built in mod loader that would be perfect!

I give a 3 star because it is a perfect game except it can get boring after a while with nothing new or cool. If we get a built in mod or more Add Ons (Hopefully subnautica and some others) I will give 5 stars

I also just as a personal thing this isn’t a bash on the game but I really wish there was more metal music. I love the Green Day (punk) Linkin Park (emo/rap) and Panic! At The Disco (alt/pop-punk) packs, but I would love to see some heavy metal stuff just cause I’ve seen videos where people mod it in and it looks fun but I don’t wanna mod my oculus and chance damaging the software, plus I understand devs are just tryna make money to eat so I try to be understanding with costs.

Track difficulty is completely inconsistent, therefore You can end up at point where you won't have any of them to train with and won't ""level up"" until You are a fan of muscle memory training or playing with decreased speed. Fans puts love only to expert+ tracks. Lower difficulty levels are scarse and poorly designed until they are - again - pop or kpop (had feeling sites are flooded with it). Many people refers to this game as fitness app, which is true only on start, because with progression it rewards speed therefore movement optimisation and muscle memory over reaction time, so it ends up that on expert+ You use only your wrists (otherwise you would need hydraulic muscles like insects) with 140 bpm after 20 min of game.",4月17日19:03,2,Waste of money.

I know there are ""work arounds"" to play music not available directly through the game... i would ask(beg) the developer team to put out a ""90's"" pack. i would gladly pay to see tracks from 'The Offspring', 'RHCP', 'No Doubt',  'Hole', 'Foo Fighters', 'Pearl Jam' etc...  at least more rock genre added.

Notes for the developers:
1. Make it possible for me to see my own top scores in each level, not just those of the people scoring hundreds of thousands points more than me (how do they do that?!).
2. When I try to compete with others, my height adjusts to a small child and I cannot increase it. I also cannot squat forever, so I can't play in that mode until you fix this.

Adding these arcs and chains is NOT NEEDED. Stop trying to change this game into something it is not. We do not need that. If we wanted that we'd buy Synthriders. I bought this game for blocks and slicing, and music. Not for arcs that dictate where I move my sabers. Make this optional or stop. If this gets added to all new songs, you're killing this game. I'll stick to modded instead if that is the case. Stop trying to ""improve""

Let me tell ya! Started with campaign mode then after playing for about 10 mins solo I jumped into multiplayer with random experienced players and they pushed me further to level up my skills, stamina and fitness with songs as ghost, ludacris and what the cat! 

The very next day I woke up with sore shoulders. A week later I came to realize when I saw myself in the mirror shirtless that my upper body was more toned, I felt more agile, stronger, more energy, just felt good in general.

2022-05-24 13:53:03.271854,"This is the gold standard for VR rythm games. Great selection of music and plenty of liscenced DLC albums. 

There is room for improvements here, like the occasional blocks that have an unexpected slice direction based on where the game has had you move your arms on previous blocks. Those are always a bit of a shock that's throw me out of just enjoying grooving along with the music. I'm also not a fan of the saber colors changing with albums. Since I tend to go between albums I find myself floundering while my brain adjusts, only to be done and ready to move on to another song from another album and starting all over. Luckily you can set static colors in settings, but seems like a bad design choice all the same. 

With that said, for being a few years old the devs did a fantastic job and have continued to support the game. I own this for both PCVR and here for the Quest 2, and and graphical difference is negligent to my eyes. It's definitely worth picking up if you enjoy rythm games.",3月18日15:05,5,Gold standard

This game should definitely have something where you could make your own beats and songs, after all it’s called beatsaber. Like you could decide what hits and beats you want, that would be awesome and make the game extra enjoyable! But other than these stuff this game is awesome.

The game is fun,  but I find myself finishing all the songs and finding nothing else to do except play them again on a harder mode. There are a ton of other songs that you have to pay for. If this game was free I would understand why most of the songs and maps had to be paid for. But this game is pretty expensive, and you still only get a limited range of songs and maps.

Beat saber is not synth riders 
Meta is a billion dollar company and your telling me they can’t afford to make a single song that doesn’t sound like a 12 year old on garage band made it

2022-05-24 13:54:04.736472,"I’m not a RPG or FPS type of gaming person so Beat Saber was the first game I purchased and it definitely was not money wasted. I took my time leveling up and playing the songs so it wouldn’t get old and boring. At first, my shoulders would start burning after 20 minutes of playing normal levels. Today, I can play an hour straight on hard levels and my shoulders are just fine, so I can only imagine that I’ve developed those muscles a bit. I’ve also lost a few pounds and have seen my heart rate as high as the 140’s when playing harder and faster levels. 

The game is what you make it. You can keep it simple and play all the songs on normal, or you can challenge yourself and play in 90° or 360° (pretty cool), or you can do one saber, no arrows, etc. I love playing multi-player with my sister and also in servers with strangers. You can also buy additional albums to play (Billie Eilish is my favorite so far) or download SideQuest and mod your game for all sorts of custom songs. My husband loves it too so we take turns playing. Four months later we are still playing it daily.",3月17日09:30,5,Perfect VR Game

2022-05-24 13:54:25.272643,"This game is amazing. It's perfect if you need a fun and rewarding cardio work out or just a reason to get up off the couch. Play is addicting, especially if you end up score chasing a lot. Believe me when I say you're capable of making it further in this game than you thought if you're willing to take the plunge.

Some quality of life changes though.

On the leaderboard it would be nice to see what modifiers people ran to get that score. It would clear up some confusion on what combos are necessary/possible to get to those top scores. It may clear up confusion for people new to the game that look at those top scores and think they're unachievable.

You guys already have the small icons for ghost note, disappearing arrows, etc in a multi-player lobby and I feel like they could fit in well sitting next to someone's score.

It's also annoying trying to keep up with what songs you've run with modifiers and this would clear up that issue.

It would also be nice to have a ""randomize song"" option in multi-player. I've been in lobbies where no one knows what to play, and having the option for everyone to agree to randomize would help clear up that issue and keep gameplay moving.",4月2日12:09,4,Almost Perfect

I’ve tried 3 songs so far and it’s been the same in all of them— it feels super random, unlike the Imagine Dragons or Linkin Park packs which are way better imo. At least I could dance along in those. Maybe they made it super random to be “harder”, but it’s more just annoying. I was really excited for some circa 2004 FOB flashbacks while I was playing but it’s just… meh.

1. I would like if there was a way to create songs from the beat saber game. This would be a very awesome feature so that vanilla players have other songs to choose.

2. It would be awesome if beat saber could add a ""beat saber songs"" tab and a ""community songs"" tab so that after you create a song, you could make it private (only you could play it or you could share it with your friends) or make it public (the song you made goes to the ""community songs"" tab). This would make the game a lot funner and so there is so much more to do! It would also get more people to download the game as well. I hope the beat saber dev's reads this and makes this HUGE update!

2022-05-24 14:00:45.074760,"So I’ll keep this review short and simple…

Base Beat Saber is a fine game. With around 35+ base songs and around 60 buyable songs the game is a very fun time sink. I can’t even begin to describe how many hours I’ve sunk into songs like Ghost and Spin Eternally on here! But a lot of the songs on here you won’t like too. I can’t say everybody will like the challenge of Ghost, the groove of LVL Insane, and so on.

This is where moding comes into play

Moding Beat Saber turns the game into a whole ‘nother being entirely. With being able to mod the cubes, walls, world around you, sabers, and add custom songs to the game it makes it entirely worth it. Ghost on Expert and Expert+ is nothing compared to songs like Reality Check and plenty of the remixed Deltarune songs by Camellia. Plus it’s not “Illegal” like the warning will give you upon opening the game. I highly recommend that, if you have a PC or Android Phone, you learn how to downgrade your game and install BMBF, as well as putting your Oculus headset into developer mode.

Without mods: 4/5 stars
With mods: 5/5 stars",10月5日21:36,5,Learn how to mod the game
2022-05-24 14:00:45.094876,I would give zero stars if could. Due to the developers ignoring peoples reviews about their new update messing the game up. I would not recommend this game due to the developers ignoring people.,4月4日11:06,1,Fix the game
2022-05-24 14:00:45.114852,"Beat saber may just be one of my favorite VR games out there that I can easily sink hours into without getting bored. It has such a simple concept but it does it so well which really makes the the experience the best. Another favorite thing about this game is the multiplayer mode. It’s so much fun to challenge your friends to see who can get the highest scores, or who makes it furthest in something like Ghost on expert plus. I’ve been playing beat saber for over a year now and its just as fun as ever! 10/10 game that I highly recommend it, and if you are getting into vr and don’t have this, then what are you doing? Get this game!",2月24日05:11,5,An absolute VR necessity
2022-05-24 14:00:55.318814,Being able to speak to people after game. More free song. Not being tossed away as a spectator without being able to hear and see the cube when you dont have bought the track. All track should  have there one saber and 360 mode.

2022-05-24 14:01:05.559217,"1. The fact that people STILL don't understand that Beat Saber X _____ just means that's it's a crossover between the artist and Beat Saber. No it is not false advertising because you can't figure that out or even use Google. I mean did you think the McDonald's X BTS meal came with the band? This is a commen thing used today and if you've never seen it you must be living under a rock or in rural Alabama. So if you're complaining the game didn't come with Billie's songs, you should learn to read/do some research/grow up.

2. People asking for Metallica. As a Rock Band Veteran since Rock Band 1, some of you have no idea how much licensing cost for Metallica tracks. It's very expensive. Why do you think movies, trailers, etc. Use cover versions? The entire Green Day pack cost less to license than like 2 of their songs. So this more than likely will never happen.

3. If you've read this far you're probably wondering if the game is worth the hype 🤔, and yes, yes it is. It's got some great packs that I recommend buying on sale, or modding the game at your own leisure. But it will make you sweat like hell and it gets the heart racing.",12月13日16:33,5,Writing a review to address stupidity 😀

2022-05-24 14:01:05.625017,"The only flaw is that there is still a pretty limited pool/variety of music. I bought all the packs that have music I like (which is about half of them), but still feels like I am playing the same songs over and over. Another issue that kind of pops up with the new packs is that they ""feel"" better, so the older packs starting to feel kind of meh/boring. For me it is really noticable with the Greenday pack. Man I loved that one when I got it and when I play it now it just feels like uninspired hitting blocks. Might be just me though.

I looked a bit into custom songs, but that was a lot of hassle and the choreography on custom songs is really hit and miss while the ""native"" songs all have great choreography (newer packs are better than the older ones).",3月13日03:35,4,Great game with replay value

2022-05-24 14:01:15.879699,"As a previous player of Beat Saber, on the PSVR, the Quest version is strides better. The fact that it comes with automatic height adjusted, just by holding the menu button, is a step up. One major thing that drastically changes this game from the version I played previously is the online multiplayer. Being able to go head to head against 4 other players adds so much more replay potential. Personally, the fun of the songs comes from the selection of music by popular artist. One flaw, with Beat Saver on Quest, is that at times swiping a block will not be registered and it would either force you to miss a block or count it as a wrong directional swipe. It is sometimes annoying especially when you are putting effort into the swings and attempting long score streaks. It’s minor and only appears ever now and then. I other than that it’s a solid game to own and a must recommend.",2月8日10:38,5,Best Rhythm Game on Quest w/ 1 Flaw

2022-05-24 14:02:38.104315,"The Game is a pretty good… well… game. It’s really fun to play and the songs are really good and they slap. But the multiplayer. I found the this glitch by running in the trees and then I ascended randomly. Then, I was teleported to the rec center, where I played golden trophy. I beat it and then I was the Gorilla tag computer with my friend. And then I walked out of the wall in FNAF security breach. Then I was on fortnite and I just killed a guy when I was playing mini golf. Then I answered a riddle about Mario’s Pokémon. After that. I was teleported back to the beat saber home menu. So yeah. Weird glitch. 

But yeah good game 5 stars.",2月23日03:13,5,My review…
2022-05-24 14:02:38.125564,"I usually LOVE rhythm games and don't normally get frustrated by them, but this is an exception. After the new wore off, I found myself not only getting frustrated, but actually coming out stressed when I was perfectly fine before.

I try so hard to love this game the way I love other rhythm games, but after even 5 minutes I'm stressed, frustrated, and want to do something else.

Games like this don't even normally stress me at all, but this one is made in such a way that it does. And if I'm being honest, if I knew about this before I bought it, I probably wouldn't have.",3月12日02:18,3,Should come with more health warning

2022-05-24 14:03:08.870055,"Ive been playing this game almost non stop since I got my quest 2, and I don’t really have any complaints, I do have a few suggestions though. 

1 - Saber customization: after a while the basic round saber starts to get boring, and I wish I had more option than just the color to work with, sabers could be awarded for getting certain achievements too. 
I also know many people who complain that the original saber is too wide, and they want to be able to have a thinner blade.

2 - Player Made Beatmaps: I know this is not likely to happen, but I believe people should be able to make their own beatmaps, if not with any song then at least with the built in songs or songs they own. This is one of the only things that I like more about pc vr, but even there the community can only make beatmaps through the use of mods.

In conclusion this game is great, the song library that is already available is amazing and the game runs smoothly. The above statements are not meant to be complaints but suggestions, and either way I will be playing this game until I can beat every level on expert+",12月30日04:43,5,"Amazing game, a few suggestions"
2022-05-24 14:03:08.890772,"Fun game, but we were very dissapointed in the song inclusion, price of song packs and especially the inability to share song packs amongst all accounts on same Occulus. For the price of the game, there should be more content.",3月10日10:30,2,Good money grab game

I buy the game expecting to play any song (or even create some) but it is only the volume, extras and the packs. I would play it a lot more if it had custom songs. I am more annoyed about the fact I waited 4 years, but a very headset with all my money to play this game, but there are barely any songs I like.

However, I'm gonna give a 3 star for now as I had an update done on my beat saber last night and bought the Lady Gaga package, which by the way is very challenging on a normal setting, at the same time. After playing on beat saber for the 2nd night after the update I seem to lose my saber light sticks, they go to the side of me and I don't have a clue if I'm hitting the cubes or not and even sometimes not even hit the cubes at all and fail the game. Its not just happening to Lady Gaga songs its also doing it to the Linkin Park package which I had for a couple weeks now with no problems before.

When she went on her account to play, the songs were not available for her to play.  They were available to play on my account but not on hers.  Later found out at the DLC could not be shared like the game.   Why was this not mentioned when purchasing this DLC??

We share games, as is allowed, along with beatsaber. The system recognizes us as a shared headset and accounts in the same household in every way but one....if I buy music, he cannot use it and vice versa. We actually have to buy the same music twice, which is absolutely ridiculous. It's like buying a new record, but only being able to play it when NO ONE ELSE IS HOME because it's against the rules for anyone else to hear it.

Boy was I wrong. I got this game because I needed to try something new. And this was it. I play this almost every day since I first got it. I even talk to all my friends and peers about it! The most addictive game you will ever play. On my second day of getting it, I already mastered an expert level!! And no, that does not mean it’s necessarily easy. Some of these levels on expert are insane and take real practice to master! (Ghost, ect) The feeling of completing any sort of level is breathtaking. A complete workout for this game as well!!

The only thing I really would love to see that isn’t currently enabled is the ability to gift the music packs to friends and family. Since the multiplayer requires both players to have the same music packs, this would be a very helpful addition. I play with my brother a lot and he is on a pretty tight budget and his music selection is much more limited than mine. I would really like to be able to send him some of the music packs I use as gifts so we could play those songs together. I know other people are probably in a similar situation.

I have the materials and stuff, I also wanna play with my friends, now if you’ve been looking for a while like me your gonna me like Oh yeah steam VR or having it on the oculus version can handle it but the thing is I have it only on quest and the difference is because if you use air link on a pc and play you won’t have it.

The problem is that if you try to purchase add-on music packs they are not shared with other users (not readily advertised BEFORE purchase). Apparently the expectation is that you can pay the ~$40 for the game once. But each user has to pay their own ~$15 per add on. That seems both petty and ridiculous. 

I am not against developers making money on their work. But this would be like having each person sitting on the couch purchase a copy of a DVD they are watching together on the tv.",1月9日03:26,1,Add-ons only work for “admin” user

Beat saber vanilla is not that excellent, it's very good 4/5 but the music are not my jam and they are a bit limited in diversity of style. I tried to do full achievement and play for 24h straight without modding when I've always played this game with mod, it miss something to keep me enjoying it like I do  with mod...

This game is incredibly excellent when you start modding it. Maybe modding is not for everyone, but just try to  add some custom song, that's easy even for beginners. With custom songs you will unlock a completely different game !! Playing on your song is sooo different and satisfying than playng with a music that just feel meeh for you.

If you want to renew with beat saber or give it his GOTY... Add your song, that all I can say, it's a game changer 👌

This game is the best game in vr as there is just so much to do and especially if you get custom songs which I have. You have to do a bit of downloading while following along with a tutorial but it’s 100% worth it but if you don’t want to do that it is fine because the vanilla game is still amazing and it’s the perfect game to introduce you to vr,2月9日08:01,5,ESSENTIAL GAME FOR VR

2022-05-24 14:08:37.601487,"... they legalize custom songs and mods! Without those, the game deserves 4/5 stars, but gets old quickly. 

Playing BeatSaber on PC - where mods are ""allowed"" - you realize how much custom content there is and its quality blasts the default (and paid) content out of the water.

So, this has to be legalized - other playforms and games manage to do this, too.",2月19日17:46,4,"Could be 6/5 stars, IF ..."
2022-05-24 14:08:37.623833,"It’s definitely what you would expect. It’s that game where you slice boxes in a certain direction to the beat of dubstep music. While that is the definition of the game, beat saber excels past that. The amount of fun I’ve had with this game is beyond what I was expecting. The gameplay loop is so repetitive but yet it’s fun. Seeing my high score go up as I flail my arms about faster and faster is something else. It truly is one of the best experiences I’ve had in vr. There is some negatives though. 

The base soundtracks included are good but limited. This isn’t really the fault of the game. It’s more of a fault on the developers. With music packs costing 12-14 dollars each you could get two packs and it would be as much as the game itself.  I can only recommend the game if you are a leaderboard hunter. Otherwise play something like moon riders since it is free and has better songs. 

But those are just my gripes otherwise it’s a great game and as time goes on beatsaber will probably be the first really mainstream vr game.",2月20日05:48,4,This game is totally worth it but…

2022-05-24 14:08:47.832773,"This game is fun but the limited music packs are boring. I’ve no problem paying for more music but there just isn’t any more to buy. It desperately needs music additions.

It is not that hard to mod all you need is a computer (anything works as long as you can plug the VR in). On the computer you will need to download side quest and bmbf and that is all you will need to download. Drag and drop the bmbf into side quest and you are basically done. The process can be confusing at first but in general it is pretty straightforward and makes the game 100x better. I 100% recommend getting this game if you are willing to do that process. I had the game for over 2 years and I always will come back to it no matter what.",1月17日16:20,5,Such a good game when modded

I've kind of found myself neglecting or putting off to the last minute responsibilities I should be on top of LOL. I want to know when the developers are going to fix the inability to share the music packs purchased within the game. I bought Skrillex me and my daughter have an account on the Oculus I got for Christmas and she is unable to play any of the Skrillex songs. It asks her to buy beat saber game all over again. How come we can share the game but not the additional content. It doesn't make sense to me.

If there was a wide variety like there is on modded beat saber, I think a lot more people would probably use it more often. As a semi-experienced beat saber user, I believe that both modded and vanilla are good, though.

A few songs are exhilarating and if you are new some songs are so difficult even on Normal that I can't even get through them. But I know that it is just me,1月28日20:35,5,Good

I play at least once a day until battery needs charging. The one and only thing I would add is more music. The Linkin Park pack is my absolute favorite and would like to see more of this genre.  Billi and Gaga are fun but I want to move and get completely immersed in the beat. What a wonderful game. Keep it up👍",1月22日05:43,5,Love it

They have banger songs for DLC too so you don’t have to mod the game or anything but of course people love to do it lol. I honestly think that the base game with all the options it gives you, is unbeatable. It literally is like guitar hero on crack for some reason. I remember as a kid being so addicted to guitar hero and growing up and finally having something like this but in VR is awesome. I honestly also think it’s way more fun for some reason.

However, for a $30 game it really should come with way more songs than it does. The fact that you have to spend even more money to get access to any fun songs is pretty absurd. These music packs should be included in the original purchase price, or at least some of the songs. The choices that come with the game are pretty lacking. Please add more “free”(read: I paid for it when I bought the game) music, it’s the only thing taking away from the experience.",1月25日14:32,3,"Good game, annoying DLC"

2022-05-24 14:13:56.428278,I chose this oculous software so that I can exercise. Though I didn’t get exactly to what I want. This software doesn’t have any of the custom made or genuine songs that come from any of the popular gaming genre. When I want to start this software for the first time I want to listen to songs like ost super meat boy. Why do I need bmbf for that and why on earth doesn’t my beat saber sense the downgrade apk/api file? I hate that I’m not getting my software to avoid athletes of outside gyms.

I use the same music over and over because of the lack of music I can get into.  Im pretty versatile with music, but I’m pushing 60 years old and would like to see something more that I actually enjoy.  Some tribal drums, even some music from some of the Disney movies like Mulan, Brave, etc.  all ages love Disney… maybe adding in a Disney package?  I’d be the first to buy!  But, seriously, there needs to be some more music packages that fit an older generation.  Kids aren’t the only ones that use this.

Im a fan of rhythm games and have always wanted to play this, and when i did it just blew me away. The gameplay is smooth and straightforward (no insanely complicated mechanics), very inviting for new players (having very simple songs to get you started), and having a ton of customizability, even without mods (saber color, background, in-game avatar, height, and much more)! Highly recommend for new and veteran vr users, this one is absolutely worth checking out :)

2022-05-24 14:14:17.052523,"It's a great game, with music from the actual artists, unlike some other types of games similar to it.  However, there aren't enough of them and music packs aren't released fast enough of them.  I never purchased the Lady GaGa pack so fast in my life, because I was bored with the limited music.  This issue causes me to leave the game because I'm just bored.  
Another issue is their height adjustment.  It's never the same game twice, where the beat blocks are at different heights almost every time.  They do have the auto height that you can use but it's severely limited.  The example below, and there's no in-between, if you're 5 ft 9 in like myself, you're out of luck.  I'm sure they can make it where you can input your actual height.  Please work on this.

There's also a pack with a 'Beat Saber X Imagine Dragons' image that does include the imagine dragons pack so that only adds to the 'confusion' ... I don't care for Billie Eilish so not a big deal but still...

The game itself is great, plenty challenging, fun and a good workout as a bonus. 
The only downside I can find is that the songs that come with the base game are more or less all in the same genre with only a few songs I really like so add-ons will be required in the near future.",11月17日15:55,4,1 less star for misleading Picture

I’d much rather have the former but the fact that both of these things were talked about and not given an update and seemingly left to rot hoping that no one would bring it up. No response to even suggesting a reason as to why custom songs well after two years later. It’s disappointing when everyone is left in the dark potential forever.,12月28日16:07,1,Empty promises.

After the first day I couldn't wait to get home and get back into beat saber. I have even taken my headset to work with me to be able to play at lunch.
I do have one request that is holding me back from giving 5 star rating. I have played multi player with buddies online and have fun playing and I would say competing but I suck compared to them so it is much more just for the fun and hanging out. That said it would be awesome if we could share songs purchased by eachother. I know this could be a license issue or a ""if you want to play then buy it"". However I do think that if we could share say my Imagine Dragons pack or my buddy's Linkin Park pack it would lead us to buy the other packs as he will be better on his packs I'll be better on mine just due to practice time so to be able to try to be better after playing in multi palyer it would probably push us to buy the next pack.
But buy more aside, it would be great to be able to share packs purchased when playing multi player cause just being a spectator sucks and just puts us onto playing songs we both have and can play.
Make it that we can share our songs and you get the 5th star from me!",2月4日23:12,4,I was hesitant

I have always loved rhythm games, and since I got my oculus quest 2 this is the only game that I have paid for. I am so exited every time I get on to play it and I highly recommend this game to anyone new to vr because it also won’t make you motion sick since you are standing still.

I don't know why while logged into the same account and essentially in the exact same store my purchase does not carry over on this game and it does on others. That fact that a game is essentially locked to one or the other should be explicitly spelled out when you go to purchase a game.

Rant over as far as the game itself it is still a tone of fun and a must have as an on the go version to show off to friends and family, sad that it is a bit stripped down both in graphics and features. The visuals are fine clear and run smoothly but are missing some of the cooler visual flair from the PC version and you can't change your sabers as you can in the PC version. overall still a good game and worth a purchase but just the one.",2月6日11:41,3,Great fun with an asterisk ✳️

2022-05-24 14:15:18.844785,"I'll start of by saying that, for any new Quest users reading this, this game is a must-have.
The different maps and levels are super immersive and really makes you feel like a Jedi, the concept and the idea behind it are incredible, just awesome.

With that said, the execution is not even close to flawless. This game has a really major issue with it randomly missing notes, and I was quite  unhappy to find out i'm not the only one experiencing this issue.
And no, it's not that i'm missing notes (because i've checked footage and i've clearly hit the notes), it's the game blatantly ignoring/missing my hits.

The main reason I didn't reduce my rating to something bellow 4 stars is that this issue only happens from time to time and there are fixes (such as changing tracking frequencies from Auto to 60Hz/50Hz and restarting the console), but it's still a very irritating issue nonetheless.

Regardless of that, I do still advise to anyone considering this game (and anyone who isn't) to actually buy it. You'll have lots of fun (and psst, be sure to mod 😉)",2月4日05:43,4,Really immersive with one MAJOR issue..

The only thing I wish is for there to be more choice of music, bring in some 90's R 'n' B and hip hop. I owned it on psvr first, but psvr tracking has its limitations. Whereas the Quest 2 I've not had any problems with. 

I also gifted it to my sister so we can play together against friends etc. Been playing this game since it was released on psvr. I own quite a few music packs. But feel there could be more variety for us older people that play it. Please bring some 90's music to this game, some friends I spoke to said they would like sone Michael Jackson as well. Please please please bring some 90's to this game",1月17日06:11,5,So good  brought it 3 times
2022-05-24 14:15:29.136133,"Such an amazing game. The tracking is super smooth on the quest 2 making this title a must buy. The only complaint I have is the fact that there are no custom songs at all, which basically means no playing anything but the songs the game give you. This wouldn’t be so bad if custom songs weren’t 10x better than the songs they’ve included in-game, which aren’t bad, but are just not some people’s cup of tea. They should add a free search bar or something for you to search any song you want to play on beat saber, and they could make something like a map creator mode where a player can create their own map using a song of their choice.

2022-05-24 14:15:39.473842,Okay beat saber. Bring on some more songs. We needs some oldies packs. Fleetwood Mac pack. Michael Jackson pack. Maybe some five finger death punch stuff like that.

Sometimes I jump up in between meetings and play around or two.  I only wish there was more music choices being a big fan of techno I’m quite happy with what they have provided and have added on the Lady Gaga pack even though I’m not a huge fan,  I am familiar with the music.

I think there should be an option for each dlc pack. Like say the Billie Eilish one that just came out. You could select that pack and then find other people that only want to play the songs in that pack. Also there are some people who want to play the dlc packs they bought on beat saber. But the problem is that they only have a couple or even just one of the packs, if they select all and then everyone chooses a song they don’t have then they will be kicked for not having it. Which is another reason why I think there should be an option to select an individual pack in multiplayer.

This also locks you out of purchasing DLC where on SR, you can do both buy DLC and install custom tracks.

 I get that there are all sorts of laws and stuff, but the fact that you have to mod the game and then deal with annoying pop-ups telling you about piracy and trying to get you to switch back to the base version is really annoying.
 One wrong click and you have to start over, remod and reinstall all over again. The inconvenience and crashing make this a 3.7 for me while the constant support and user friendliness of Synth Riders push that game to like a 4.8.",2月1日16:11,4,A good workout

Also I am very against the money grab they have for music packs, not a great feeling to pay this amount for a game and see some songs you like just to find out that the packs are pretty expensive, too.

And then you find out you can just mod it to get whatever songs you want for free anyway, which really grinds my gears because now you’ve separated people who can mod from other people who can’t mod and ultimately will feel cheated out of their cash.

I think this needs mods. Or the ability to change my saber. Or my cubes. I want to personalize my play experience. Like cool sabers or cubes etc. I’d even pay like 1.99$ for different saber skins. 

Also. I think there needs to be more and better way of editing my controllers. I’ve seen mods for the pc version of this game that let you see what angle you are holding the controller and let’s you adjust it so the way you hold it is more accurate. 

Finally I think there needs to be more song for me to buy. I want more bands. More artists. Sorry but billy ellish and lady Gaga don’t really do it for me. I did buy the linkin park pack and it’s amazing. I really want more like this.

And exercise! Good aerobic. I like to get into it and move my whole body to the music. After about 20 minutes I always break a sweat.

Also, in a world of subscriptions, I really appreciate the  music packs are one-time purchase. Like the artist? Great! Buy it, it's yours. Don't? Great, skip it. Plus they're then downloaded so it still works online or off! 

A little hard to make this full fun at parties. Better if the audio from casting (to TV) was more in sync so the experience could truly be easily shared. But that's an Oculus issue, and still everyone wants to have a turn anyway!

If I could ask only one thing, it's bring more music packs more often. There's enough now to keep me busy, and love that I can just throw on the headset and play.

I bought the monstercat volume 1 and the collab between monstercat and something else because i loved the songs and thought the maps would be fun to play, especially on expert, and they weren’t sadly. On the plus side, I have bought most of the other packs because I absolutely positively banged my head so much to those songs and they did not disappoint. I especially love the BTS one!!! But anyways, I love to play this game for fun before I go to bed, but it can get frustrating when things like this occur :(

However I watched a video on YouTube and the person changed up their saber to a long saber’ it was also on their feet! The video showed all sorts of different play!! How do I do that ??? Is it perhaps another add on??  Anyway regardless the game is brilliant worth every penny. 

My only criticism is that the music isn’t the greatest it’s too loud to crass! Linking park, lady Gaga’ green day!! Isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. The free music makes no sense’ especially the song that’s dedicated to CRACK!! Awful!! Come on let’s have a R&B pack, let’s have a drum & base pack, not everyone is a head banger. New music please.

2022-05-24 14:18:54.885270,I installed this game 2 weeks ago and it's incredible. My relatives have tried it and they all live it too. The songs aren't that bad but it's definitely worth buying a couple song packs so you can play the game to familiar songs. I cant think of anything bad about the game but the only thing I would add is custom songs. I see people download songs onto it but it's a fath and I'd rather just do it from my phone. But that's not necessary but it would be nice to have. Anyways there'd nothing bad about the game and its worth the money and very reasonable since its so much fun.,1月8日09:44,5,Overall amazing
2022-05-24 14:18:54.913183,So I've really enjoyed playing beat saber it's a really great polished game. But even with the dlc there is not enough songs. And if you go back to a earlier version like 1.17 and patch the game to be able to download custom songs right in the headset. You get warning messages about breaking terms of service and how this could be bad for your account. I really dont want my headset bricked for playing custom songs. Once beat Saber and Oculus work this one out instead of telling us what we can and cant do with the items and content we bought. I'll rate it 5. Also if anyone can point me to away of getting custom songs on my quest 2 without the risk of being banned. That would be great.,1月27日18:20,3,Great Game. Unsure about modding.
2022-05-24 14:18:54.944073,I use this daily for my workout and its great.  only 4 stars because of the limited music options - need something for us more mature users like some classic rock n roll maybe some oldies.,2月17日04:38,4,Love it

That is when I discovered unlike every other game I'd purchased, Beat Saber had decided to disable the ""Multi-User accounts and App Sharing"" feature.  That means you have to purchase the app and song packs multiple times if you intend to share a headset between family members.  Definitely a greedy move on their part.  I might be more understanding if this was stated clearly pre-purchase within the store, but it wasn't, thus the reason for my low rating.  Looks like others brought this to their attention 7+ months ago, yet in the multiple updates since, the feature remains disabling.  Seems clear they want the extra $$$.  Not from me; won't be buying extra copies, or any more song packs from them;  either for myself or my wife.  Too bad because it was fun to play, until this discovery soured me on it.",11月17日05:45,1,Does NOT allow for Multi-User accounts

Some additional ideas for improvement:
* song progress and time indicator would be very useful
* possibility to restart few seconds before the last failure in practice mode would help as now I have to guess / remember where I dialed
* 50% speed minimum is still too fast for me when I tried practicing an expert plus song. It would help to be able to go slower than that.",1月23日08:59,4,Great game but limited songs.

It would be great to have a setting where you can overide the game part of if you don't hit the cubes 'correctly' you can just keep playing (like the demo). He only gets to hit 2 or 3 till the game finishes and he gets frustrated and looses interest. 

It is an excellent game for people with autism as it teaches them so many hand/eye coordination and working with crossing over the mid line body movements (which people with autism struggle with and is very important to work on). Just be great to have a on/off setting while they are learning and mastering the app.",1月22日10:36,4,Please make more autism friendly

I do, however, strongly feel that there needs to be more variety of songs added (popular/well known songs) as well as a bit of classic rock (fleetwood/toto/the eagles) etc..
It can get stale quick otherwise

There's endless fun with this game and it doesn't get boring after a while just because it offers so much and its such a great rhythm game. Potentially one of the greatest vr games created (imo)!

2022-05-24 14:20:37.742834,I love that you can share this game between profiles but before I spend another dollar on music packs it needs to be able to be shared if bought under the device owner. I will change my review when this is available...until then I will check out other like games and see if their add on's allow for sharing if so that's where I will focus my time and funds. This is so disappointing. As this is a family occulus we have 4 accounts but we also have two occulus quests and we download two of every game so we have access on both devices however we will not download another beat saber since music packs cannot be shared as well.

I one played this game for the graphics. The tracking has lost its way. This game is sometimes painful to play because the tracking is just so horrid. 
I never thought I’d say that synthriders is more fun but little by little I’m playing synthriders more and more. It just works better. The workout is not as good but at least I’m not frustrated. 
The developers cannot be reached. 
I think it’s time the developers listen because the game, that was once the best, is now very frustrating and disappointing because it just doesn’t react well. Pity.

Original review for comparison:

Short and sweet -amazing and brilliant game.  This game puts you in another world of rhythm and beats. Once you start you can’t stop playing. Age is not an issue here. It’s relevant to all age groups. Highly recommended. Absolutely worth the price.  

As cliche as this sounds I’d love to have an add on with classical music! I’d pay for this add on. In fact as a developer myself, I work in slam and 3D, and as a music lover, I’d help out with the movements too!",1月24日08:17,2,WAS The best game - now a disappointment

I just don’t see how everyone goes on and on about how they still play this 9 months later or even 2 years later. Sorry but the game is incredibly repetitive. The campaign is overly tough in my opinion. I’m stuck on level 11 I think and i can’t see myself passing it any time soon.
Don’t get me wrong… the game is great fun and perfect to show friends. It just gets old is all. Pistol Whip & SuperHot are much more my style of Beat/Exercise than Beat Saber. Also, I think the music packs are way over priced for what you get. I paid $30 for a music game with zero popular music included. No, I have to PAY $10-$15 for each little popular DLC music pack.

Pros:    Has a decent enough library of songs, different modes for each song, and has music packs        that come out yearly with about 4-10 songs each.

Cons:   Needs thinner saber's, library gets boring easily because of lack of songs and or genres, and in need of a marathon mode.

Modded
Pros:   Custom everything!  better lighting,  free unlimited library,  and is easy to set up.

Cons:  Can be laggy due to certain mods like Akiatweeks or Chromia,  hard to get custom saber's, and certain saber's can break the game.


After everything is give vanilla a 4/5 and modded a 4.8/5

Just to let you know how much i’m enjoying it, I’ve already spent 10 hours on it. One thing to look out for, is that it MAKES YOU SWEATY. With it being fast paced, and you have to move a lot, you start to pour sweat. After every song i have to take off my oculus and wipe down the sweat. And you don’t want the sweat to stick, (especially if you don’t have a silicone cover). But apart from that, it’s an amazing game.

You can get lots of custom songs (popular songs, and for free) in Synth Rider, and Synth rider has a much prettier interface too. In here, customs songs are just not supported, and frowned upon. It feels like a rip off to buy all these music packs that can cost you >$100 easily.

2022-05-24 14:23:01.839862,"So to put it simple, this game is really good with friends and by yourself. You don't need dlcs or nothing. This game's just perfect, but if you want a better experience, buy a dlc pack or two. Most of them have really good songs and the graphics are super good and gameplay wise you could play this for hours. It's just a matter if you can survive the sweat, but overall 10/10!",12月28日14:53,5,This game is a must have.

Its like the sabre doesn’t register it’s hit a block 

Tried everything to fix it but just keeps happening and is very frustrating and unplayable.

I own a PSVR and got a Quest 2 because got sick of the cable of the PSVR getting in the way but never had this problem.
And out of the 2 headsets I really would of thought the Quest 2 would work better.

Hope it’s fixed soon as I find Beat Sabre fun and addictive.",1月17日19:57,3,Good but unplayable for me

When I have them above my head they go flying off screen, they will miss blocks entirely, and not register on swipes. I’ve tried everything, but I don’t know what else to do and found online that a lot of people are having this problem.

I'm very new to this game and I'm not very good either but with each time I play the game I can feel myself getting better.

2022-05-24 14:24:03.634860,"This is a very fun game that provides quite a bit of exercise without it feeling like exercise. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5? The add-on music packs (which are the only way you get to play with real, mainstream songs) don't share across profiles. So if you buy one, only your profile can play those songs, even if someone in your household is playing on the same headset and you only had to buy the app once.  You can share the app between profiles, but NOT the add-on music packs. Stupid, and very frustrating.

But, it loses one star for its money hungry cash grab. While it comes with plenty of content, if you want to add music packs they cost 10 to near twenty dollars and the real kicker..... When you app share, you can not use the add in packs and you can not buy them if you are using on the second account. We have 2 quests and wanted to play multiplayer. So instead of buying twice, we set up both with the same account, then added a second account on one of them and app shared.

I'm randomly missing notes that I would definitely not have missed on my Vive, the audio somehow always feels out of sync with the notes despite tinkering with the audio delay settings, and the overall experience just feels like it's lacking in performance and optimization. I get that PC's are stronger and able to process things more quickly, but I recently bought Synth Riders and that game does not have the issues I've listed above. Synth Riders also has better music than Beat Saber. I would say there are only 2 or 3 songs on Beat Saber's OST's that sound somewhat decent. I love Beat Saber, but it is a s### show on the Quest.

2022-05-24 14:27:29.786546,"Beat Saber is a fantastic game. It’s what sparked mainstream interest in VR back in 2018. Back when few people like me had a headset since 2016/2017. The game is very simple, slashing cubes with light sabers, but my god is it perfect. Each swing feels satisfying, haptics in the controller making it feel REAL. Sparks flying out of the sliced cube, laser lights all around you like a Pink Floyd concert, while you are slashing to the rhythm feeling like Anakin “disposing” of the younglings, DOPAMINE HEAVEN. 

The game is a workout too, (mostly on hard to expert+.) I always have sweat dripping down my facial interface to the point where I have to wipe it off. (Which is why I picked up a silicone cover lmao.) 

The game is easy to pick up, but hard to master. I’ve been playing for a long time now, it only took 4 months to get the hang of expert plus, and I still suck at “Ghost”. If the built-in songs aren’t enough for you, there’s always DLC. (I recommend Green Day and Linkin Park because the mapping works really well.) For the Beat Saber team though, I’d recommend making more rock music packs. It works so well in a rhythm game! Pink Floyd/Aerosmith/Metallica would really make Beat Saber feel like a different game. Techno and pop gets old really quick. And frankly, I grew up with 70’s/80’s/90’s rock, and the bombastic chords, vocals, and guitar riffs would make this game a million times better.

Another thing we need is custom mapping on Quest. PC already has it, and if it were on Quest, sales would probably be through the roof. You CAN use mapping on Quest, but it is far from official, and is a long process. Mapping your own songs would add so much replayability! 

In conclusion, buy Beat Saber, it’s a must have, we really need Quest mapping and hard rock music packs PLEASE, thanks for reading. 👋",10月13日11:38,5,GIVE US METALICA

The slashes match beats well so you feel like the gameplay truly sinks with the music in your ears. DLC songs are well tailored so fans of lady Gaga, Billie Eilish imagine dragons and more can experience what I would consider their best songs.

Only complaint I have is the interface is a little overwhelming when you first start, with little tutorial. Additionally you should be able to add to your device’s leaderboard while in solo.

I wish they'd come out with new music more often. Now that I'm playing on E+, I master a new music pack pretty much within the first few days. I'm gonna keep trying to install the modded version, (but it never works). 

When playing multiplayer, you both have to play at the same level... which totally sucks when you dont have any friends who are even passed hard. It's not fun if it's way too easy. If we could play the same song at our own level, it would be better.

The purchased songs reside on the admin account and any other accounts even though on the same device have to re-buy them. 
If you have 3 accounts on 1 oculus headset that means you may have to buy a song or album 3 times. This seems costly and excessive. This is also probably why a lot of people are modding. I am happy to buy songs legitimately but not 3 times for one headset. There also needs to be more song choices to buy. I do like that you can buy singles though so you're not stuck with songs on an album you don't like.

It's amazing. There's also multiplayer so you can play with friends, If you want a Rythm game then get this one. It's truly the best :)


Update: So I did manage to mod it. But the mods weren't that good and didn't do much.

I can't recall if it started from the last update version but, the sabers disappear for few seconds and very often on both devices. I thought it was controller issues but, it happens with this app only. I play tennis, table tennis, bowling, shooting and fitness games and more. No issues on any of them.

I also tried to fix the problem with factory reset and repairing controllers. Didn't work.

By the way, very good app. Congratulations, excellent job.

12/24/2021

It's frustrating to be on level 11 on campaign, and see again how the Saber disappears, when you're not allowed to miss or mistake any beat. I started playing with headset 100% battery and 80% on the controllers. I know it's not the controller, because only the light saber disappears, not the Saber handler  and it's only for one beat, after that, the light saber shows up again. On a regular level, I can keep playing but, on campaign, that's it.

I hope you fix that",12月25日02:39,3,Some performing issues

2022-05-24 14:34:01.704461,I like the game because there is many songs to choose from but sometimes it just randomly kicks me out idk if it’s because of my oculus or it’s just the game. Other than it kicking me out it’s a good game. So if you know how to fix the problem please help.,12月31日00:45,4,Good but some issues
2022-05-24 14:34:01.737373,"love the game but am confused it says beat saber x billie ellish but those songs are locked behind a pay wall i figured this version would include them

2022-05-24 14:34:11.993262,"The game is fun and all but the game locked my headset in an endless loop of installing an update. So Please don't get this game, it's not worth bricking your headset of the ability to update other games",12月18日12:05,1,Updating the game was too risky
2022-05-24 14:34:12.025174,"I enjoyed beatable for the 1st month or so then once I realized there was no way to get any music I liked and all the songs we played HAD to be bought and they are all the early works and nothing recent it gets old.. did you know that Laren Diegle (probable misspelling that), For King and Country, Elevation Worship ALL have amazing music that personally I believe would take beatsaber to a whole new level..  maybe if game worlds would STOP rejecting God's presence they would see: 1 God is in EVERYTHING and 2 We like to party",12月10日19:33,2,Living in the past

2022-05-24 14:34:12.120946,I bought the 29.99 deal for beat saber with Billie E. Music pack but it seems like it didn't come with it. The one I purchased says Beat Saber X Billie Ellish and has Billie Ellish on the cover. I have installed it three times now and it still says I have to by the pack. What a scam and false advertisement,11月29日03:39,1,False advertisement
2022-05-24 14:34:22.262969,"You know, this game is GREAT by itself, but when it comes to playing with friends, it's abysmally useless. I can't play with a single one of my friends. Not one. I'm able to play on expert + and beyond with custom songs, but if I want to play against one of my friends, it's terribly boring. I don't want to be stuck playing on easy or normal. It's just a slow, drudgingly slow experience for me. It would be fantastic if beat saber integrated a shared experience where multiple people can play on different difficulties, but share a similar score based on perhaps how many percentage of notes that you hit, or something similar. 

Single player experience fantastic.
Multiplayer with friends is below useless though.",12月21日10:10,3,Friend compatibility

2022-05-24 14:34:32.693566,"Personally I like the idea of the game, however I think the music sucks.

2022-05-24 14:34:32.723486,"Now that there is account sharing... 

Edit: Does anyone get a refund to a game they purchased to play on some one elses console (Quest)? Clear money grab by Beat Saber. Poor customer relations. It'll be hard for me to purchase anymore packs, etc from this team. 

Original: How has this been missed.... OR, why did the developer turn this feature off as it is on by default? My partner primarily plays Beat Saber... So we have to buy the game twice so we can play it on the same head set?

Hopefully account sharing coming to Beat Saber soon. Its like having a Spotify subscription or buying an Album and not letting anyone else in the house play (listen to) it except the purchaser.",12月2日19:55,1,Now that their is account sharing...
2022-05-24 14:34:32.754404,"Like I get it that y’all gotta make money off this, however adding the ability to add our own songs or even change the patterns of current songs would add a lot more playability",1月15日22:05,4,Could do with custom songs
2022-05-24 14:34:42.955424,"This game is just Amazing, it has little content but it lasts for a while to complete since this is a game where you can just keep improving no matter what, and most importantly  you can excercise and have fun.
Once you get better and start playing on expert+ the game changes a bunch since the songs are way faster and the patterns are more difficult to hit which means better exercise and if you like fast paced games it's more fun.

After you complete the Vanilla version of the game try modded, the content modded beat saber gets is probably never ending because of it's community who keeps constantly adding content like custom songs or game changing mods like modded multiplayer, therefore it's very worth it and very fun.",11月29日13:04,5,Never ending game

2022-05-24 14:35:13.967426,When I saw beat saber X Billie Eillish I thought that pack would come with the game I should of done my research but at the same time it shouldn’t say that if it doesn’t mean that. All and all it’s a decent game I’ll get on and play a couple songs then move on to something else but it’s always fun to play some Green Day or panic at the disco or linkin park even BTS.  The base songs aren’t that good so if your not planning on modding or getting dlc this might disappoint you.,12月17日03:00,4,I agree with another reviewer.
2022-05-24 14:35:14.000370,Love the game. It was the reason I got into VR. Just one thing for me that the game is kinda expensive. The same game on Steam is sold for around 12 USD in my country and like 3 to 4 USD per song pack. Overall really enjoy it and would suggest to people who want to exercise while they play in VR,11月29日19:04,5,It is quite expensive

2022-05-24 14:35:14.067192,Beat Saber is like my favorite game. I don’t really know what could beat it. AND you can mod it! If i could give a thousand stars. I would.,12月31日07:01,5,Its amazing!
2022-05-24 14:35:24.299555,I bought the Beat Saber x Billy Elish pack but there are no Billy Elish songs included!? I can then spend another $12.99 to buy them... why not just advertise Beat Saber and say clearly all songs need to be purchased separately?  Now the game even is not modded is a super fun workout and a real challenge that takes me back to DDR  in the arcades with dozens of people watching us go crazy! This game is all that and more. I'm just starting to explore it but I'm very happy with it.,12月3日09:23,5,Great game and worth 5 Stars but...
2022-05-24 14:35:24.330151,"If you haven't already tried Beatsaber, you must do yourself a favor and buy it. Oculus has an easy refund policy, though I don't suspect you'll use it!

Beatsaber is an amazing and immersive experience that also gets you active and moving. My only gripe is that a lot of good songs are locked behind dlc, however they're always on sale. Beatsaber is worth the price of admission and it's good to know there are more songs to get down the line.

In terms of VR comfort, Beatsaber excels. Whether sitting or standing, I've never had a problem nor has anyone I've shown the game to. Plus, there are a variety of difficulty increases and decreases that can be toggled on or off. Although playing for a high score is some serious fun, my guilty pleasure is to turn off arrows (since I'm no pro!) and jump the difficulty to extreme with headphones. That to me is the ultimate immersive experience I've had in VR!",11月29日04:45,5,Beatsaber is a must play experience

2022-05-24 14:35:24.418951,"First, I'm reviewing the base game, not the modded one. There is lot of pros in the comments, so about cons:
1) No custom songs!! (promised in 2019 and available only on PC version)
2) Expensive song packs (few songs for a price of some other full games). I am not surprised people are modding the hell out of this game.
3) Too much of annoying ""electro"" music, too few ""normal"" songs (unless you buy expensive song packs).
Beside the above, fun game.",12月19日02:28,3,Good

The modded version however is AMAZING you have everything from new sabers to different backgrounds, new songs with custom everything you can imagine. Basically it is like a new game and it’s great.

""Which one we going for?"" with the response of ""The Billie Eilish one"". Everyone buys at the same time, jump in and find that Billie Eilish is an extra charge! Very naughty given how its promoted in the VR version of the store with massive cover image and NO hint that buying ""Beat Saber x Billie Eilish"" does not give you Billie Eilish. One of the group goes and buys the extra, we are all set to play again ... only to find EVERYONE HAS TO PAY otherwise you have to sit it out!!!!

2022-05-24 14:37:38.551627,"It's a good intro to VR. I just bought my quest a couple weeks ago and glad I played this first since other games still. Make me nauseated but this is just good old fun. Would be great if they included more kpop songs, like TWICE. There are mods but they're mostly all expert and as a newbie in the game I can really only play til hard.",12月10日13:29,4,Very fun
2022-05-24 14:37:38.582693,"Game is good with fun gameplay and decent multiplay, but pricey with it.

Compared to other music rhythm games, this game seems not to have particularly effective algorithms for dealing accurately with less than ideal lighting and shiny surfaces - when playing, I often 'miss' notes that I hit accurately, so it is frustratingly random whether I can achieve a full combo or win in multiplay.

Beat Saber does not officially support mods, so I would not recommend buying it for what might be here today gone tomorrow at the first whiff of trouble for the devs.

If your money is tight, I suggest first looking into Audio Trip (which I think has the best dance workout and included music, and even has a built in track editor), Synth Riders (which also has multiplayer and a custom track community) and Pistol Whip. The first two are far more affordable and all are great, with their pluses and minuses. If you're into metal, try Ragnarock.",12月11日07:45,4,Decent game but pricey
2022-05-24 14:37:38.613406,"I play it daily for 30-40 min., I find it an amusing experience and good for a little fitness work. I grave It 4 stars out of 5 because I find interesting only about half the songs, and the packs are a little pricey.

2022-05-24 14:37:59.180868,"If you're interested in this game, I would advise to reconsider. Maybe buy Synth Riders instead. They officially support custom songs. And the default songs that they have are better. It has a demo you can try.

Anyway, let's get started with my review.

This could have been a good game. But if you don't like the genre of music they give you, then there is only one option and that's modding the game to unlock all kinds of music. But here's the problem... They do everything in their power to make modding hard. I never got the mod to work on my device after many hours on several days of trying. And even if I got it to work, every game update breaks the whole mod until the mod gets fixed I have heard.

This game simply gets a huge amount of free advertisement from all the videos that show lots of different genres of music on the internet. While in reality, there is almost no song variation at all. I don't really like a single one of them, even though I am a huge music lover. All the devs need to do is branch out to more genres. I am sure lots of artists would love to have their song officially licensed in this game instead of only be playeble through mods. That way less people will mod the game anyway. The devs are just not trying to please anyone but their own taste in music.",1月1日00:48,2,Could have been good...
2022-05-24 14:37:59.215749,the game is really good but i have just one issue. every time i play i always get misses even though i precisely hit the note. its starting to become really annoying.,1月6日06:22,4,cant get a full combo

2022-05-24 14:38:19.782650,"In spite of the ridiculously few song choices (music packs included, not to mention music popularity) this game alone makes it worth buying a VR headset!

Why ""a VR headset"" and not Oculus? Because in spite of introducing family sharing, you still have to purchase the game + music packs for every user - which can amount to A LOT depending on the headcount in your family.

Wanna have friends over regularly and compete over high scores? Tough luck! Not only do they need to log in with their Facebook credentials, they also need the game - purchased!

The only alternative is to let them play on your account which means ruining your personal records(scores, calories burnt, playtime and what not) not to mention this is against TOS for every respectable gaming platform. So if this is your way of getting people to purchase your game, try out your device and get into the Oculus ecosystem, not only are you bottlenecking yourself, you're making it a pretty underwhelming experience.

Unless of course you're targeting socially awkward individuals who have no family or friends and wouldn't wanna share anyway!

Some people stop at ""Facebook"" ...the rest throw the idea out the window at the mere thought of the expenses involved of introducing it to their family. Might as well buy a gaming computer but the hassle of switching steam accounts on it is another wall nobody wants or cares to take down.

2022-05-24 14:40:33.853990,"I would not recommend any VR game for fitness. It's just not the correct platform. Perhaps in a few years more sensors will be available to reflect full body tracking. 

That being said,  it is a fun game that can get your heart rate up. The levels start off easy and within a month you'll plateau and getting better requires real work. There are enough songs as well as a campaign option and multiplayer option and invite friends mode as well. 

One of my complaints is that I ran out of songs quickly. I pay $30  for the game and now they want me to add on music packs for $10-$15.  Not interested.  For as popular as this game is that is very expensive and the additional development is minimal. 

Most youtubers have jail broken their Quest2 and Sideloaded music packs free with the understanding that it voids the facebook license and disables the multiplayer option. 

I think adding a 20-30 song free music pack, or dropping the prices would get more people into this game.  After a few months I play it maybe 2x/week and get bored.",12月4日12:41,3,"Great musical game, not fitness"

The games 30 bucks right? And the add ons in total are about mmm 400 BUCKS WHAT?! Listen its beat saber its so popular and I dont know why.

Pros
YOU FEEL AWESOME.
VERY SATISFYING

Thats it.


Cons
GETS VERY REPETITIVE.
MULTIPLAYER IS SO GLITCHY.
ADD ONS ARE NOT FREE AND THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.
EASY TO LEARN INSANELY HARD TO MASTER WHICH GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO THROW YOUR HEADSET ACROSS THE ROOM.
Customization is just standard they didnt try.


IF YOU HAVE MODS THOUGH THIS GAME IS FIVE STARS.

I always get bored of a game after about a month playing it, no matter how good it is, but this game is an exception. I fell in love with this game, got good, and when I wanted more, I just modded (which was easy as cake (if you want to mod just download BMBF from side quest straight onto your quest (if you don't have or don't know about side quest, just look up ""how to install Side Quest on YouTube, although the side quest app has its own in app download tutorial, so it's pretty simple))). The Modding community is amazing, and with one of the recent updates, we are soon to see the BeatTogether mod, noodle extensions mod, and mapping extensions mod all come to quest! (for context to potential buyers, these mods basically remake the whole game over again, but better, with more customisablity. The base game itself, mods aside, is pretty good. There are only a few (as in about 50) free songs with the game, but that number is steadily growing. You can buy music packs, but in all honesty, Modding is free, and waaaaay easier than you would think, so why not just mod? Beatsaber for the quest 2 is constantly getting closer and closer to PC beatsaber in terms of looks, modablity, etc, so don't be too fussed about looking for it on PC (though of you have a good PC why not just go for that) all in all, one of the best games to ever hit VR, and if you don't own this game, buy it, *especially* if you were into games like piano tiles or the like.",10月11日02:48,5,Perfect game

2022-05-24 14:42:48.371112,Incredibly worth the money as unlike most VR games there’s tons of replay ability even after completing the campaign. I’ve been playing for months now and have only bought a couple of the extension packs but still find it fun and enjoyable. You can easily sink hundreds of hours into this game while still having room for improvement and fun playing. Overall a great purchase for anyone looking for a game that you can play for tons of hours and still have fun.,11月9日06:17,5,A Must Have For Anyone With A VR Headset
2022-05-24 14:42:48.404359,"I mean, what can anyone say about this game?  It's basically an institution for VR at this point.  Beat Saber is fun for everyone from casual to competitive, young to old.  The learning curve is fairly easy until you start getting into the transition from expert to plus, but dlc (and custom for many) can help bridge those gaps.

It can be relaxing.  It can be a workout.  It can be fun for a group of friends (streaming the POV, and getting to watch how silly we all look playing.)

The game is constantly updated for QoL (with more hits than misses), gets dlc at an increasingly steady pace and often gets free content.  

I've got quite a few of the more 'mainstream' VR rhythm games, all of them are great; but this is the game I'm always coming back to, looking to improve something, from accuracy, to technique or maybe just to FC a song I've been trying to work out.  

Hope this helps someone!",11月9日04:49,5,Do you really need a review?

2022-05-24 14:42:58.787332,"Simple game, yet very fun and very satisfying.
I would give it 5* if it wasn't for the outrageous money-milking rip-off.
You pay 30€ to buy the game and have a very limited number of (not great) songs.
Then each new pack of 8-10 songs costs 10-20€ each. Absolutely outrageous, for a game that is already pretty expensive for something so simplistic.

This puts beat saber to shame, compared to other big VR examples. E.g: walking dead S&S - 100 times more complicated game, and yet, when they release a DLC with 6-7 hours of new campaign and a brand new horde mode, the DLC is free for anyone who bought the game. In comparison beat saber asks for 15€ for every new songpack you'll play twice...

My advice: try the game it's fun, ask for reimbursement after 1h50min, and do not buy any songpack to not encourage this shameful marketing strategy.",3月7日19:57,2,"Fun & very satisfying, but a rip-off"

2022-05-24 14:43:09.079052,"How many times do people have to tell you that your game rocks but your music sucks? I’ve bought my last music pack from you until you start putting out music for “the rest of us”. You have to have the musical tastes of a 12 year old from Wyoming to listen to this noise. Not everyone likes the same kind of music. You devs need to deal with that reality and finally, at long last, do something about it. I would play this game every single day if there were more than five songs I could tolerate. But Beat Saber has become a torture for me because I’m bored. BORED, as in I can’t listen to this bubble gum crap not one more time. I want music that people like me can get into, not being 12, or from Wyoming. And I’m not giving you one more dime or one more star ⭐️ until you hire some diversity and start coding some Salsa, some Merengue, some Jamaican dancehall…something ELSE. 

And I don’t just want ethnic diversity in your music catalog. If you really want five stars from me, I need you to pretend for a moment that older people have more money than their kids and grandkids, and put out music for people who’d kill to be able to Beat Saber to some Van Halen, or Styx, or Led Zeppelin, Cheap Trick, Tom Petty, or dare I ask…QUEEN!!! Folks who would pay whatever you’re asking to Beat Saber to “We Will Rock You”. I’m not saying that you devs are racist or ageist. I’m saying your music catalog is. It’s fixable, but it requires that you ask for help in this area, and take the time to look for and hire devs who know this music and can properly code it. I guarantee you, they’re out there. Contract out the work if you have to. But do it, because if you don’t, eventually some other developer will. And then THEY will get all my money.",9月30日10:29,1,This needs to be said…

2022-05-24 14:43:29.640806,"I'm not usually a fan of over-hyped games, but this one is legendary. Yes, I know, EVERYONE knows about Beat Saber so you're probably thinking it's another crappy super-popular game but this one is worth every freaking penny and provides nearly endless amounts of fun. 

The concept is simple. You've got two light sabers. A song plays. Cubes fly at you. You slice them to the beat. Seems simple. 

Until you realize that your entire body is getting sore and sweat is pouring down your face and back and your alarm on your phone is going off because it's time to get in the shower and go to work. Yeah... not only do I play this game for fun, but it has accidentally also become my morning pre-work workout as I try to beat harder and harder levels and get higher and higher scores. 

You'll kinda accidentally become addicted to it. At first you're just having fun. Slowly but surely you get so drawn in you're finding yourself doing weird little dances that the song doesn't really require, or song exaggerated swings... just really getting into it. You'll find yourself pushing yourself to beat this difficulty setting... then... maybe making it a little harder to challenge yourself. 

I love it. My kids love it. We take turns playing and will cast our game play to the laptop so the others can watch and cheer us on. 

This is ridiculous. 

The graphics are amazing, there is a huge amount of songs that come with it plus a ton of albums you can buy... you just can't go wrong with this one. 

Every Quest 2 should IMMEDIATELY have Beat Saber on it.

Edit: finally tried multi-player and it has added an even more insane layer to my Beat Saber addiction. I want to write a big, long thing like I usually do about games... but words escape how much fun the online play can be. Again... if you do not own this game, YOU ARE MISSING OUT. GET IT IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS A REASON IT SELLS.",11月10日12:53,5,Just get it. NOW.

2022-05-24 14:48:49.852665,"This game is really fun and, in my opinion, one of, if not the best game on VR. Some things I have noticed when getting my friends into it is that:
1. People who have played other rhythm games or have watched people play BeatSaber on YouTube do far better than other people starting out, so if you find getting your first song done annoying, try watching it on YouTube, because it honestly seems to help.
2. I got the demo version first, which is a Normal difficulty of song (compared to most people that start on Easy) and that helped me to advance more quickly through the difficulties, so before getting it, I’d recommend playing getting that one free song first to help warm yourself up to it, because I could see it being frustrating to some people spending a lot of money on a game and not doing well at it at all.
3. If you need a very easy song to start with, either in the beginning of the game or while advancing to new difficulties, start with the song Beat Saber. Until Expert+, where it is the hardest song, I find it is the easiest song to get through.
4. If you’re looking for a challenge, try the Camellia pack and OST (Original Soundtrack) Vol 4.
5. The paid DLCs are almost always better mapped and better flowing than the OSTs, so if you have money to burn, definitely get those.
6. This probably sounds weird but I find that I do so much better when I just tune out on a map altogether. I just start thinking about something else and I just breeze right through the song. I didn’t realize this until I think Hard difficulty when the songs actually start to get a flow instead of just hitting blocks.
7. For me, FitBeat (Extras pack) and Burning Sands (OST Vol 3) are some of the best-mapped songs in the original maps.
8. I recommend playing with a wide stance in your legs so that you can lean out of the way of the lasers/walls/whatever people call them instead of stepping, which, when you have a smaller play space, quickly results in hitting something. Remember, only your head cannot go through the laser walls, because the headset doesn’t detect other parts of your body, besides your hands, which can go through but I prefer to avoid it because the vibration kills the controllers faster. My only suggestion would be to add a setting that disables vibration.
9. This took me forever to figure out, but proper form for Beat Saber that gives you the most points per hit is hit the block in the direction of the arrow and in the center of the block, and to use your wrists to deliver the hit, not your arms. The wrist flick motion is what gets you a higher point score, so use your wrists to deliver, and arms just get you to the hit.

One more thing: if you don’t like techno music, you probably won’t want this game, because most (if not all I’m not the best with music genres) of the songs are techno, but I’m pretty sure that can’t really change because you can’t really map other types of songs as well as techno. I just had to add this after seeing some negative reviews about how bad the music is.
After reading more negative reviews, I’m also adding, yes, some of the songs are not as fun, but that does not mean AT ALL that you should not buy it, because there are still plenty of good songs, even if you haven’t heard of them.",10月19日05:59,5,Great Game! Tips for New Players Here:

2022-05-24 14:50:43.658149,"Beat Saber was my first experience when playing VR, and it is so much fun! I don't have that many songs yet but probably will get some more later on.

2022-05-24 14:51:14.486638,"I recently got my Quest 2 about a year ago, and I got this game about a month later. I absolutely fell in love with it immediately. It’s even better when you have a PC. With a PC you can have custom songs, sabers, blocks, and walls. You can also install mods with a PC.

The only downside is the song selection. There are 4 song packs with an average of 5 songs each. You can’t really complain about that, but if you want songs from people you’ve actually heard of you either have to pay for a song pack or download custom songs.

Final opinion: I think that if you own a VR headset you need to try this game. It’s really fun and addictive.",9月4日12:50,5,Best VR game I’ve ever played

Now, I’m in my 60s, so probably not in Beat Saber’s target group!  I wish they’d add some country rock & classical music, though.   In spite of the music, I like the app.",10月26日11:12,4,"Love the app, hate the music"

2022-05-24 14:51:25.016862,Over the past couple days I have come to love beat saber. My only issue is that there is not enough song choices and if you want more songs they cost $2. Other than that it’s a great game.,11月3日07:01,5,Great but not enough songs

2022-05-24 14:51:45.647876,I've had beat sabre now for a little over a month and I've hardly ever played it.  I enjoyed the demo when I used it and thought Beat Sabre would be worth the forty dollars or so I would have to pay.  I discovered every song other then the one in the demo sucks.  I actually look forward to the end of every routine.  If I paid that much for a game with nothing but crappy music I certainly am not going to fork out more money for a expansion pack.,10月30日21:37,2,Bucking the Crowd
2022-05-24 14:51:55.805422,I wanted beat saber so badly when it first came out. And then it came out and there is barely anything to do. No search bar nothing. I even decided to give it another chance with the Halloween event this year turns out they went cheap on that too giving  you ONE SONG to play and that’s it. I would give it one star but the game is fun to play with the very limited things to play without buying dlc.,10月26日11:24,2,Very disappointed.
2022-05-24 14:51:55.839268,Please add a random song selector or the ability to make a play list. It would be so amazing to finish a song and it just rolls into the next song.,11月6日02:35,5,Amazing game needs a random song button

I do wish that they'd add lyrics to the bottom of the screen for people who like to sing along.
And like everyone out there be able to add custom songs.",10月6日09:23,5,Can't own a VR set without beatsaber
2022-05-24 14:51:55.943627,"Beat Saber is a really good game. I tried it first thing when I got it as a surprise from my parents. Me and my mom play the game (almost) every night now. Like some other reviews, I wish there was an easier way to play custom songs. I have enough money for the link cable and I found a watch-worthy tutorial by Naysy on YouTube on how to get custom songs. I love playing this game all the time when I have time, and this is probably the only game I play on my Quest 2 besides Rec Room and (edit: barely, now.) VRchat.

Beat Saber is my #1 game to play on my Quest and I would recommend the game to people who are interested in VR rhythm games and my Roblox players who play Sound Space.

Overall rating: 5 stars.

(Would rate it 6 stars if there was an option for that.)",10月5日13:49,5,Amazing Game!
2022-05-24 14:52:06.153885,I seen this game a while ago and wanted to play it so bad but I dident have a VR yet but just recently I got a VR headset and I downloaded thus game and at first I dident think it would be how I expected it but it turns out it was way better then I thought it would be so I recommend this to anyone who likes to do a lot of moving and anyone who wants a quick workout even tho it's not for working out it for fun it really includes lots if moving so make sure you tighten the strap on your controllers because I almost finger my controllers lol but thats just my luck so when your playing make sure to tighten the strap on your controllers!

Then they  decided to do Billie Eilish like why. Who’s idea was it to go from rock, to about 4 ok songs, Then go to dubstep again, and then decide to go to the chick that’s on every 12 year old girls wall.

2022-05-24 14:52:47.532349,"I'm going to be completely honest right now, this game is the only thing that kept me from evolving into a potato over quarantine. It's a great game that always seems to pull me back in for more, however as much as I would love to give this 5 stars, I can't. The addon music packs are simply too expensive in my opinion,. However I'm not going to make that big of a fuss about it, they're optional and if you really want to, you can just mod your game to add new songs ( though I'm not one to do that, but that's personal preference )
There are a bunch of songs I would love to see added, but I understand getting the ability to use songs is difficult and not all creators will say yes to having their songs put officially in game. (Part of why the add-ons are so expensive)

The game offers a VERY limited selection of songs, it will charge you extra for every additional song and with no justification.
The web is full with more songs to add to the game but the Oculus quest 2 version will not let you play them.
This is especially ridiculous given that you know artists will literally pay to have their songs avialable for free.

But like all VR games it has some cons to it, it might just be my headset sensors but my saber sometimes disappears but that fixable with just a quick headset reset.

Good luck trying not to break your hand or something, anyway, for 30 this was a terrible purchase. Honestly, I just want my money back, cause this is ridiculous.

Now I wish it was my first purchase. This game is great. Very immersive and a decent selection of songs (wish there were more genre choices). With how popular Synthwave is, and standard Drum n Bass, I don't know why those aren't represented, but even the songs I wouldn't listen to outside of the game are a lot of fun to play along to. They seem to add new song packs (for purchase) fairly regularly, so it should keep things from getting stale; plus there are a bunch of different game modes and difficulty settings and you can play with others. Can be played sitting down too and if you are very confined, you can turn off leaning dodges, so you can keep your play area small.",9月26日08:15,5,Fantastic rhythm game. Glad I bought it.

2022-05-24 14:54:51.683640,"Bought beat saber in 2019 on vive and enjoyed it but only occasionally played it. Played it daily since i bought my quest 2 at the beginning of 2021.

No wires and having everything contained within the quest 2 is amazing. Also nice is that beat saber doesn't require an internet connection. It's so easy to stick on your head and have a blast with any spare moment. 

Other games come and go but i keep coming back to beat saber. There's a great element of skill to this game. It's only cutting blocks but the music is enjoyable to listen to and the game keeps getting faster and more complicated as your skill progresses. It's easy to pick up but super difficult to master. 

At this point I can complete a load of expert plus and expert feels fairly easy. It was hard work for a while getting to a decent level, but now it's amazing. Far from being the end of the game, this is when it's started to get really good. Every expert plus track is such an amazing workout. I usually try and play a few expert plus songs when my energy is high, then i play expert until my arms don't work anymore. I've lost a load of weight, toned up, and it's such a great way of blowing those cobwebs away from your brain and waking you up.

I'd like to try the new songs but no way I'm going to basically buy over priced albums. They should be added into the game for free.

2022-05-24 14:55:22.672966,"When I first got my Q2 I browsed around for games to play and Beat Saber kept coming up. I thought nah, that looks boring, can’t be bothered with that.  It then occurred to me that a great way to get used to the system would be to download as many free games and demos as possible and try them out - even this one. OMG, I found myself counting down the minutes to the end of work, so that that I could strap on the Q2, load up the game, and slice, slide, dip and glide around the room, dodging what looks like ice blocks coming towards me at a rhythmic parade, where I’m standing in the middle of the road and no one’s stopping!

It helps that the demo track is good and great at catching your interest as it eases you into the game at a comfortable level, making it both fun and accessible. Once you’ve been hooked and purchased the full game, there are loads of customisable features which mean nothing is too hard or too easy.

There are a good few tracks that come already installed. However, I found that the genre is limited and I could only really start to feel in my element once I started to download add ons. This is a shame, as I’m not into rock so it limited my game play. It would be amazing if the standard types of music that come installed could be expanded to fit a wider audience, even if that wasn’t what it was designed for. House, jungle, grime, RnB etc would all lend themselves nicely to this game. Also the choice of add on genre is also quite limited, although better than nothing.

For 30 dollars we should be getting much more and higher quality content but instead it screws you over and puts all the decent songs behind overpriced paywalls. Sucks because PC version offers unlimited songs and customizations for no extra cost and quest 2 is more than capable of doing that. The game is ruined by greed. If you have the money to drop 150 dollars on this game for all the music then yes its a fun game but for average people you get next to no content for what you're paying for.

2022-05-24 14:55:53.495584,"While I find 1 star reviews of games pretty funny like DOOM Eternal, this has gone out of hand.

1. App sharing

It was Beat Games’ decision to make this game unsharable through the Oculus App and Quests. Just because a feature of Oculus wasn’t turned on for a rhythm game, just shows that you just like to criticize anything for the smallest things possible.

2. Modding and Custom Songs

There is a fundamental difference between the PC, Quest 1 and 2, and PS4 version of the game. On PC, it’ knowingly easy to edit the files of the games since they are in the Program Files folder and that it’s a Unity game, so it can be modded very easily. For Quest 1 and 2, the game is an APK file, which can only be ran on BlueStacks or another Android device, such as the Quests. Because of this, it was harder to crack the game open to mods and custom songs especially considering that the game was updated a few days before a BMBF update was released for 1.14.0. For PS4, modding doesn’t exist. This was for legal reasons, which is completely understandable on Beat Games’ part considering how much they make off this game alone.

3: Tracking and other errors

These are either problems with the Quest, Unity, or the game has a common bug that many people don’t make a review towards. In the tracking case, it depends on the situation. If you’re sure you hit a block but missed, chances are really high you just missed it. Also the new DLC pack exists, but I personally didn’t buy it. Not to say that the game is worse this way, just that it now appeals to a bigger audience that like different genres of music. But the bug it causes (and apparently in an update) where the game doesn’t start up, I can’t help you as I both don’t have the pack or a Quest 2. The best thing I can give is update your Quest 2 or get a refund.

TL:DR: Stop criticizing this game for all the small things. Games aren’t perfect, and though progress on fixes can be slow at times, fixes and updates roll around to give new things and fixed areas that are heavily criticized are gone. And if you want to just play Ov Sacrament And Sincest ranked or whatever weird tech maps exist, just get Oculus Link, buy Beat Saber on the application, and get ModAssistant.

Stop being stupid. It hurts all our brains.",7月9日14:44,5,Please read this review before buying.
2022-05-24 14:55:53.532656,"You seriously can’t go wrong buying this game. Insane amount of fun and new music packs increase replayability. One feature I’d love to see is a “workout” or “QuickStart”mode where it can just pick random songs for you, perhaps to fill some sort of configured timeframe. This would be useful for using this app to exercise. In the future, this could be expanded on by allowing you to configure difficulty ranges to use when randomly picking songs, or whatever else might be tweakable to keep it interesting.",9月5日16:08,5,Awesome!

2022-05-24 14:56:03.859654,"I bought my quest in February 2021 and I knew that this was going to be my first game, I have played on a friends quest and I loved it. I got the game and went normal on $100 Bills just to warm up and it was way to easy, I went hard on a different song and it was still easy I went on expert and I found my sweet spot, expert+ is if I want to challenge myself but overall this game is definitely recommended to anyone with a VR headset even Playstation VR. 

Devs, if you read this i’d recommend adding a anime opening song pack in OST 5 but preferably a payed add on just because it’s not for everyone but it would be really cool to play Crossing Fields by LiSA on beat saber! Thanks",9月20日04:51,5,If you have $30 and a VR get it now

Its apretty cool and fun way to get a bit of a workout...... but, i am losing interest a bit because of the music selection. Why does almost everything have to be techno style or r&b?

Get some ac/dc, pink floyd, and especially alot of Blue October. Theres a free vr rythm game online that has a much larger selection of music and i am enjoying playing that more. Beat sabers graphics are way better and the game play is as well but when you listen to music while working out, cause lets be honest this is a work out routine just as much if not more than it is a game, dont you wanna listen to music you like?

2022-05-24 14:56:45.257055,"Im going to start with the bad and why someone might not like it.

The song list is still in its early stages, and some of the best songs you have to buy.

It is a rhythm game. So if thats not your thing, you might not be too interested.

Motion. While it has some good options and settings for accessability. At the end of yhe day, the game still revolves around bright colors, and things flying directly at you while you try and hit them.


Other then that, I've had nothing short of an absolute BLAST with this game.

While its song list doesnt feature too many popular hits, like say, just dance. The songs it does have are really good. Amd all fit the game incredibly well.

The tracking is amazing, and the depth perception is also fantastic.

Its not a dancing type of rhythm game, but it is still one that gets you to move your entire body, which I love personally. Im not big on dancing.

The visuals are really simple, but impressive. It drfinately looks and feels like a top notch AAA game.

My only real problemis the difficulty on some maps. There are some songs that feel too easy on one difficulty, but the next setting up you might lose within the first 10 notes. Specifically some expert to expert plus songs.

But other than that, nothing will ever get me to stop playing this game. Love it to bits!",7月6日15:40,5,I literally bought a headset for this...

2022-05-24 14:57:16.132905,"I want to preface this by saying that I get motion Sickness and cannot easily enjoy most VR Experiences properly.
Beat saber allows me to explore all that it has to offer without getting nauseous, and that's a big plus for me!

It's active like Just Dance, and challenging like Guitar Hero, and I love it!  Every song has it's own feel and rhythm, with five levels of difficulty to Master.  It comes with six albums of music, and more available for purchase if you tire out on the OST.  Although, I'd strongly recommend pushing yourself to run that CAMELLIA song you're afraid of first!

With the addition of online multiplayer, you can meet other players in live competition!  Randomly find others through Quick Play, or challenge your friends in coded rooms!

I tend to be very critical of simple arcade games that try to oversell with cliche story taglines. The simplicity of cutting colored boxes with lightsabers to music, is something I find pleasure in.  And while I search for better VR story games to play, (that won't make me nauseous,) I know I can always fall back on Beat Saber.

And if it's not already overstated, I highly recommend this game.",8月10日14:11,5,Best VR Experience to date

2022-05-24 14:57:26.516741,". While it is worth buying without any of the new packs and playing there are way to many songs that are choreographed way to easy and or boring . My family was sooo waiting for The bts pack , especially the song dynamite only to find the choreography of the blocks to be a bit boring . My son was a bit bummed out by that . I rarely beat a  song on expert on the first try but I beat this one right away. Now the song dna on the other hand was crazy fun. 
  Another example is from monstercat pack . The song overkill is a major hit with my family , while the song we won’t be alone , was seriously easy and boring. I know others who own and play beat saber and they all say the same thing. Way to many songs choreographed either way to easy or just plain boring. 
  When you play through a song and finish . You want a feeling of , WOW , what a rush . If you do not , then adjust the choreography until you do. 
 One last issue . I have tried expert plus and rarely make it through any song at all. To make the song expert plus I see to much reliance on simply speeding up the block to super sonic speeds. Would be better to rely on more intricate placement instead of focusing on sheer speed to make the song expert plus.

 After all I do not like I still highly recommend everyone buy and play this. It is the only game ever that I rate only 3 stars but still highly recommend. When you play a song that is choreographed well it is crazy fun.
Check out online , player made songs. Especially the ones with seriously high ratings .

 Update .Great, another song back. ? Not great. Makers of beat saber seem to be obsessed with adding songs with filthy language more and more now. I buy the pack forgetting to inspect there song choice. My son tries out the new pack and asks why if beat saber is rated for (everyone) why they are adding songs with filthy language. I forgot to inspect the songs so now I just wasted money on there new song pack. The filthy words are blocked out , but only 90% giving you a clear indication of every word. Beat saber should not be rated E any more. And again songs are mostly uninspiring in the block placement. Most are boring and super easy on expert. Equivalent of hard level of quite a few of the much older songs. 
 Finally had enough as we are retiring beat saber..
 Do not even get me started on not letting us share the game in same house hold like so many others do. Seriously on the greedy side to expect in same household to buy beat saber and all the packs all over again. Especially with the direction of adding more and more filthy worded songs and uninspiring block placement. 
   Cannot recommend any more.

 Another pack. They are addicted with adding filthy worded songs for some absurd reason. My son was excited to see another song pack. But when we went over the song lyrics mostly all we see are yet again filthy words. Even him as a kid knows better, shook his head and said he could not support playing beat saber any more. A song the (devils den) for some unknown reason they just do not seem to care anymore to put out anything good!!!!",9月1日12:25,1,Not so great any more. 0 star

And then I landed on top of a taxi but the driver didn’t hear it so I ended up riding on the roof of a taxi all the way to Africa. And in Africa I let a cow and a goat play beat saber. They liked it. In fact they liked it so good that they layed down and never got back up. A-anyways so I ended up finding an endless mud puddle over there in Africa while doing the waka waka dance and yeah. I swam down and down and down and I ended up.. IN CHINA. I’m like how in the world does that even happen. So yeah I learned how to use chopsticks over there. And all the sudden I had to take a crap…. Like real bad… and so I walked in dollar general over there and did my business and what happens next? I fell in the dang toilet.

I have two different oculus quest two headsets and I have the same problem on both of them. I cannot find any settings to fix the problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it is still not working. I’m hoping somebody here can help me. I just test it again and it works fine in the tutorial. I’ve gone into all the settings and cannot find any place to fix this.

I am so glad they had a free demo because I was sold immediately. Then when I bought the game I found I could adjust it to my skill level, even my disabilities. I have a problem with my right arm. I cannot do knee bends. ￼You can set it for one arm. You can do both arms but if you make a mistake, like with my weak arm, ￼set it to not knock you out of the game. ￼ And instead of doing knee bends, you can bend at the waist. I just love that no matter how many mistakes I make it won’t knock me out. The songs are fantastic and really inspiring for a good workout.

You get to do all sorts of levels/songs as well as add on songs if you got the money (example being BTS and Imagine dragons). This game allows you to feel the music and makes almost dance. HOWEVER, the game can be very exhausting. My arms felt really sore after completeing some of the difficult songs on expert. The game will also usually make you sweat, A LOT. And when you fail a level, if you're like me, you will be filled with rage and yeet your controller across the room. Overall great game 8/10 or 4/5 stars.

otherwise, this game is just immaculate. easy to get into, then becomes HORRENDOUSLY addictive.
when you master actually hitting the blocks and stop freezing up like a dumba$s when a song becomes too complicated, after you master all of the dirty little tricks pulled by the song mappers, you work to master the games scoring system (and ruin your wrists in the process)

I've been playing this across PSVR and Quest over the course of almost 2 years now and i still play it on a very regular basis. as even after all this time it remains fun and with the custom song community literally testing the limits of human movement and reaction time, all there is to do is get better at it.

I am 43, and this techno mix synth stuff sounds like a car wreck at 200mph.

If you get into VR this is a must have. It can get a bit expensive if you want some extra DLC but they're so worth the money. The devs put in some free songs and extra features once and awhile, like when I started playing a few years back there was no online feature and it only had 2 song packs.

However, if they were to somehow find a way to add this in a future update, possibly even collaborations with music streaming services to import your playlists, this would definitely earn a 5 star. But until then, the experience is limited to the few songs included, and the subsequent DLC packs.",8月16日05:37,4,Do you need to ask?

2022-05-24 15:07:26.124973,"So I was playing my daily round of multiplayer beat saber and I was doing spins and stuff because I thought I was soooooo cool. Little did I know, I was being a little bit too enthusiastic.... 

I was in the middle of a song and in first place when I did a spin that was a little too quick for my headset. Time slowed down as I watched my headset fly off my face like an anchor ready to plunge into water. Adrenaline rushed through my veins as I bolted to action! I wasn’t gonna let this one mistake break my headset. My hands reached out but sadly my controllers were in the way so I couldn’t get a grip on my headset. Both me and my headset crashed to the ground and I looked at my headset in panic. There it was, the foam pad that once covered my face was no longer connected to the headset due to the impact. But other than that, the headset looked fine! I could still hear the music of the beat saber song playing out of my headset, so that was a good sign. I quickly put the foam pad back onto my headset and put my headset on my face. A sigh of relief. My quest 2 was not broken.￼ 

In the end I lost that beat saber game but I am very relieved that my quest 2 did not break. 

This game is so good that I almost broke my headset because of it. I am very addicted to this game and if you’re looking for a first game to get on your new (or old) VR headset this is definitely the game to get. It is a blast!

P.S. 

To Beat Saber devs, 

It would be pretty cool if you added the option of voice chat in beat saber multiplayer.",2021年4月2日13:26,5,My quest 2 flew off my face....

You won't be able to use voice chat once the song starts of course. 


My song ideas would be more of the artist and you'd be choosing which songs fit your game.

*Jack Stauber
*Melanie Martinez
*Billie Eilish

For Jack Stauber I would suggest ""There's Something Happening"" and ""Tea Errors"". I feel like people who are fans of Melanie wouldn't mind purchasing a music pack consisting the full ""Cry Baby"" album and her newest(last time I recalled) ""K-12"". As stated earlier,  use whichever songs you see fit for your game. I'm pretty sure you'd have to spend a bit of money because it's their music. Also, just to make sure you don't waste your time, if you have social media or a website for your game, ask the players if they want this. I'm pretty sure you already know to do this tho😑😅

In summary,  I love this game. It's fun!

Edit: I love the new Interscope music pact. The first music pack/add on I ever bought. Is amazing👌👌I'll be back for the next update✌️",7月21日07:49,5,So much fun! + song pack ideas

2022-05-24 15:09:20.114434,"This is coming from the perspective of someone who’s had this game for 2 years btw, I’ve just never actually had the patience to write out a review.

If you’ve watched any sort of tier list or list of recommendations for VR games the past 2 years, you would have heard of Beat Saber, it’s possibly the most popular game in the VR genre to date and it deserves it, it is a very simple game with a very simple premise. Your main goal is to slash the coloured blocks flying at you to the beat of a song with lightsabers, as you play for longer and longer you will get better and better while progressing through the difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, Expert+. It sounds very simple, but is such a blast to play, especially with the recently implemented Online mode, I can destroy my friends playing $100 Bills on Expert+ and it’s so unbelievably addictive and fun!

If your looking for a VR rhythm game, then Beat Saber is the way to go, no doubt in my mind.
I would like to mention also the base game includes 36 free tracks for you to enjoy, but there is also paid DLC you can buy for affordable prices, some DLC packs include songs from: BTS, Green Day, Imagine Dragons and Panic at the Disco etc.

Modding: You may have seen YouTubers playing custom songs on Beat Saber before, sadly it is a very difficult and janky process to modding your game on Oculus Quest, if your looking for mods do not buy from the official Oculus Store and instead buy the Steam Version, it is a lot easier to mod with that version.
If you are looking to mod your game on Quest, I would highly advise you to proceed with caution, you will be installing a 3RD Party copy of Beat Saber onto your Quest, and 3RD Party Software, the chances of anything bad happening to your Quest is VERY unlikely, but please still Mod at your own risk.

Thank You for reading my review! I hope it helps! 😊",7月6日17:42,5,An absolute blast!

Most of the expert+ levels are really poorly designed, and they vary in difficulty enough that I feel like there should be an expert++ difficulty, since some of the levels have 4.5 notes per second and some have over 8.5 which is a huge range. Also it doesn't really explain well how to get more points per note hit.",7月31日03:36,4,Good but could use some improvement

I also feel that it has enough physicality to serve as a bit of exercise while I'm playing too.  The difficulty ranges really well from easy enough to be picked up and played by anyone, to insanely challenging even for a Jedi master.  
I'm really disappointed though that 6 months after multi-account was launched on Quest 2, that this still isn't supported.  I have three children (and a wife) who like to play on my headset and although there is a ""party"" mode which allows us to set local high-scores against each other, it would be much better if they could log into the headset on their own Facebook account and log scores on the global high-score charts as well as try out the ""story mode"" which I have to ban them from so it doesn't spoil my fun.  It seems that the only motivation for not supporting this feature is money, I can't see any other reason why they can't enable this.  I can't afford to buy the game four times over (I've purchased it twice now, as one of my sons has his own headset too), and I don't see why I should have to.  No other platform would expect you to purchase a game multiple times so it can be enjoyed by family members who share a device.

That flaw is that a lot of the times the hits don’t register. This can get very frustrating. I’ve watched the blade go through the block once and it counted as a miss.

-
官方谱之所以难，主要是因为方块排布模式丰富多样（导致大脑和手不能及时反应过来）。现在看来，这不但不是缺点，反而是它的优点，是谱面质量的体现。
-
面对困难，重要的是找到克服困难的途径。
目前发现自己的短板一方面是的左手反应不够灵活迅速，所以着重通过单手模式训练左手熟练度；
另一方面是对不同谱面排布的打法不熟悉，通过打开No fail修改器或Practice模式不断针对单曲进行重复练习，进而掌握不同谱面的打法。

2022-05-24 15:12:26.287379,"I am a huge fan of rhythm games, so when I bought a VR, I had to pick this one up. 

After a few weeks of playing, I can say that this game is very fun. 

The graphics are great, the original music is great, and the game feels satisfying to play.

Although it's a very fun game, there are some issues that somewhat bother me.

Starting off, the lack of a way to manually modify the scroll speed of each song is a big issue in my eyes. Since the majority of the other rhythm games that I have played (DDR, Sound Voltex, beatmania IIDX) have all had ways to modify song scroll speeds, I expected this one to also have it. It was a big letdown when I found out it didn't. This is a big issue because many charts that I would normally be able to play have too fast of a scroll speed for me to be able to read it. I know that after a while of playing a rhythm game you are able to progressively read faster and faster scroll speeds, but the speed some of these songs are at such high speeds that it's very uncomfortable to try to play them. This isn't as much of an issue, but some charts that I want to play become boring due to having too slow of a scroll speed.

Another issue that I have with this game is chart quality. This one may be a bit more nit-picky than the previous issue, but, in my opinion, some charts in this game (mainly some of the earlier, harder charts) are extremely uncomfortable to try to play. I doubt that anything can be done with the charts since it's best to preserve the original charts, but it would be nice to see a remaster of them eventually, especially since the developers have obviously improved drastically at charting. (I LOVE the volume 4 charts)

The three final issues I have with the game are very nit-picky, but I'm going to put them here anyway. First, it would be nice to see a number difficulty rating system. I know that notes per second is what is typically used, but it isn't always accurate. Second, the lack of custom charts make the 30 dollar price tag of this game very questionable, in my opinion. Still an enjoyable game, but I don't think it should cost 30 bucks with paid DLC and no custom song support. Finally, physical rhythm games where you use parts of your body extensively (example: DanceDanceRevolution) shouldn't have 5 minute long songs. Songs over the 3 minute mark, if challenging enough, can be very painful for players to try to complete, and people don't want to be sitting around playing the same song for a long time. Rhythm games like DDR solve this issue by cutting down parts of songs and only leaving the highlights of them. It would be nice to see something like this happen with beat saber, also. This doesn't mean other games don't have long songs, but there shouldn't be this many. Another way to implement continuous, fresh gameplay is to add a course mode system where players can choose a few songs (or select from pre-made lists) and play them without any breaks in-between.

I hope this review helps. I apologize for any confusing parts of it, I just typed this entire thing on my phone.",2021年6月28日13:29,4,"Great concept, but could be better"
2022-05-24 15:12:26.366269,This game perfect if you’re looking to smash something won’t you grab some light sabers and smash and blocks although you do have to have friends to make a party and play with them it’s still fun to use where you can challenge yourself to beat the companion and finish all the course all of that seems impossible to me it is very easy to use since The day I got it I had an issue with it I honestly love it if you feel like this game is it for you it’s either the bright colors which you are allowed to change or is it lovely song if you were thinking that you could get the songs that you see Youtubers use you cannot you have to have modded it there is a way to MOD it but it takes a little while and I don’t know why anyone would want to MOD it when it is such a good game honestly this game is kind of it’s another to 10/10￼,7月5日07:07,5,I love this game

2022-05-24 15:13:07.784920,"I have to admit: Beat Saber was not one of the games that made me initially jump into VR. I've seen videos of big youtubers (notably variety creators and not exclusively Beat Saber players) playing it when it first came out and thought it looked neat, but it never fully grabbed my attention. A friend suggested I should get the game anyway when I bought a Quest. It seemed like one of the essential games to get when getting into VR for the first time, so I went with it.

I don't remember how or when it happened, but I fell in love with Beat Saber. I brought my Quest to family gatherings so that everyone I knew can love Beat Saber just as much as I did. I wanted to get better at the game, and by my first month of playing I was already starting to get the hang of Expert+.

When the Multiplayer update rolled out alongside the Quest 2, that's when I knew that I was hooked. Not only did you get to compare scores with people all over the world, you can also play with them in real time. I have met so many amazing people through Beat Saber; from jumping into a public lobby and pantomiming at the other players, to somehow adding each other as friends and talking over Party Chat during gameplay. There's something magical about that. I'll never forget all the hilarious and heartwarming things I've seen other people do between matches.

However I know the game developers have no other choice but to not allow it well because of Facebook, a company a good majority of us here aren't a fan of . But I will look forward to more songs in the future and besides that its a great game and provides necessary content for everyone to enjoy for friend's, family, and young children, but as I said earlier the ability to put your own music on it would be a great addition.",2021年6月27日06:00,3,The game is fun but is lacking content.

Overall I've had fun with what I've played but the price is well...pricey 30 dollars is not bad but, for this game i dont think its worth that much.

Each time you nail a song it feels like an actual accomplishment. Then you can push yourself even further by adjusting the difficulty, game mode, or perks for that song. Also, if you put some effort into your movements this game is actually a pretty decent workout as well — and if you do play enthusiastically, the game rewards you by giving higher scores too! Most songs are very well choreographed and if you're a little rhythmic you'll easily get the hang of them. The only downside to this game, in my opinion, is the rather small selection of songs you can initially choose from or buy. I'm willing to pay for more songs from some of my favorite artists, but unfortunately there are not many on offer (yet?). Maybe some Glass Animals, Justice, Muse, or Metronomy please?

With different environments and color customization ￼you can give it a fresh feel whenever things start to feel a bit repetitive. 

It offers multiplayer customization so your in game avatar has a unique look.

Different challenges also add replay value. 

But where this game shines most is as a party game. Nothing beats having friends come over a stream the headset to a television so your friends can cheer you on not just watch you flail about like some out of shape cyber samurai. 

The game has released several free tracks so it’s not all about having to pay for music. All in all the one thing that is stopping me from giving this game a 5 sat rating  is:

I recently bought a quest2, my wife created a profile on my original quest and I shared the library yet this game doesn’t appear available to her especially if I am on it. We actually tried to play together one night and wound up having to play something else because we couldn’t get it on both. This could be a technical issue and I truly hope it is.

There are a lot of squares that come your way and you need to break them in the direction of the arrow on the cube. The cubes come at you at the beat of the music, and it makes you feel like a god when you beat a harder difficulty. If you look in the background of each level, you can see stunning visual effects. And as you dont need to move, you dont get motion sick! (you need to slightly tilt to dodge walls but it feels natural.) By far the best VR game out there.",2021年6月27日06:12,5,

2022-05-24 15:14:30.652146,"My biggest issue with this game.

I use Quest as a cardio machine which also provides some fun along the way. Beat Saber is an obvious go to game for cardio and fun. The biggest issue is the scoring system.

I know I would appear as a noob or complainer when I say the leaderboards are lacking in variety. Right now, the only way to get top ten is to play the game entirely in invisible blocks, along with fast speed, which isn't very fun to me. If I wanted to do any other mods or even just normal gameplay of the song, I have no chance of getting a top score. This is a flawed score keeping system which Pistol Whip has seen through and will change by giving every modifier combination it's own leaderboards. I don't know if this game can do something similar but it will certainly help the replay value of the game. It's just not fun to play every song with invisible blocks and sped up music.",7月16日17:00,2,One of the best but some issues.

2022-05-24 15:15:12.021999,It’s a great game that I had lots of fun with but the dlc packs are very expensive and they don’t really offer a lot of free good songs IMO.

2022-05-24 15:15:12.062840,"I've tried the similar VR rhythm games, of which there are plenty, but this is the one I keep coming back to, none have quite nailed the feel and energy as Beat Saber. It's a great game to give VR beginners to as it is comfortable and intuitive to play. It can be a great work out, even more so than some of the dedicated fitness apps. On Expert+ you will be constantly moving and you will be sweating!

However, as a flagship title, sadly it isn't a great ambassador for the platform. No cross-buy, so if you want to play on PC you'll have to pay separately for that version. Also, you can't share-play which is a poor showing from the Facebook owned devs, so households with multiple headsets can't share the game across accounts. Also, each update seems to bring more issues, in particular the tracking has gone downhill from the earlier days. The graphics have improved however.

The included songs aren't my kind of thing but they are still fun to play. It's a shame the default playlists don't have more variety genre-wise, without having to buy the pricey DLC of course. Speaking of the DLC, as a Green Day fan, the songs in that pack are quite disappointing. I can't imagine many fans clamoring to play tracks from 'Father of All MFs' over some tracks from 'Dookie'.",7月12日19:16,3,"Unsurpassed gameplay, poor value"

Music Packs options on Quick Play are lacking, you only choose from Build-In or All. It kills it for people who have bought the tracks. The tracks we pick usually don't get picked, because built-in tracks get the final pick. And if we do get picked, sometimes those people don't even have that song in the first place. So people end up leaving. 

I feel like everyone will be happier if we have the third option. Unless the people who don't have the tracks can still join in the multilayer, and not sit on the sidelines. At least that might stop them from constantly picking Crystallized track.",2021年6月21日16:33,5,Quick Play is a bit...

I love that I can bring some martial art skills into this game, that turns it into a my personal dojo. 

I drop into horse stance, and chop with my arm. For an enhanced workout, I move with my entire body, and swing with full force. Sometimes I add weights to my wrist and ankles, too. 

After a few weeks, I found my core muscles. Then my posture improved and I started to develop some arm muscles. My reflexes are better than eve! My gut functions improved from the regular exercise (I'm coeliac with IBS).

 But one thing i ask is the pc type wall effect. I get that it's hard to put something that runs from a pc to a oculus quest 1 and 2.

 I am a type of person that loves games with amazing graphics. And even without the walls I would still be good with the game. But as a  teenager and can't afford to buy a gaming pc to run the games on pc is sometimes frustrating. I do everything on my phone. I get that I should be happy with the oculus quest 2 I got, which I am.

I've been play for about 8 or 9 months and I finally beat all imagine dragons Playlist in expert+.

All I really really want is the pc wall effect. Even if you need to put it in 120hz mode which I turned on a soon as I got it.

So for anyone looking to buy a music exercising game this is perfect for you honestly i can say this is the game i spend my time most on.

2022-05-24 15:19:10.449164,"Multiplayer is a missed opportunity for varied skill lobbies. (Between friends and families). 

It’s only “enjoyable” to play in a lobby where the players are of equal skill. 

An expert player doesn’t enjoy playing on normal or easy, and a NEW player won’t keep up with higher game modes and as such will be left spectating for every single game.

PLEASE: 
1. Allow a “jump back in” button. 
(So what, you lost points anyway you can’t possibly win). 
Let that person continue to play along and improve/get better. Spectating is so boring.

2. Allow a social game mode/ handicap button so I can crank away on expert and my little cousin can join and play along with me on easy.  We could go all night, socializing, exercising and enjoying each and every song to our individual skill levels - both improving day by day but still having the pressure of failing a song at our respective skill levels…

NOT one person I have met (I had this on rift for years). Enjoys spectating… And NOT ONE person I know enjoys playing outside of their skill level for more then a few games. 

And, no… having a “no fail” game is not fun if you’re an “easy” skill person trying to flail your arms about in an Expert game. No fail is akin to playing a death match FPS where you can’t die, consequences are important but respawn exists in online games so you can lose points but have another crack AND KEEP PLAYING NOT SPECTATING!!!!!!!!! Ahh!

Again, unless the lobby is of the exact same skill level. Multiplayer is a short term game. 

Absolutely missed social aspect of an otherwise must have game. 

(I now own 3 copies that’s to quest and rift and steam store). So I’m being harsh but above is an undeniable reality of online play. 

In short; Please make a game mode that caters to varied skill level lobbies. And at a minimum a respawn button.",10月2日21:47,2,Devs. MISSED opportunity...
2022-05-24 15:19:20.734552,"Hey developers!
It’s great you guys keep updating with new songs and such, but how about adding a feature so multiple people can have their own profile? We have one oculus for our household, but 3 people use it the most (especially this game!). It would be nice to be able to keep track of how we each do instead of trying to remember what our own best score for each song is. One of my sons and I are having a friendly competition on who can get to and pass each level on certain songs but it’s difficult since one of us may do better one day and then the other gets on and tries to beat that score without realizing it’s not their score! Give us separate profiles!!! I’m sure we’re not the only ones that would LOVE to have that feature. Thank you!",2021年6月7日12:34,4,Need multiple profile settings

But now that I’ve come back to it again, it has blown my mind a second time. It really feels like you are engaging with the music percussively. By nature of using sabers, you’re slamming against the “notes” and it feels like actual drumming, vs something like Audica (another good game) where you shoot targets. The sensation is so incredibly satisfying. And 360 mode (when it’s available) is amazing.

The amount of free music you get is deceptive because the first two OSTs are not good. You'll find yourself skipping over them every time.

There's no cross-buy with the Rift version meaning you can't even play modded on a PC with Link, why not? This of course also applies to DLC.

If you want to mod the game on Quest, good luck. It's difficult and you'll likely have to give up updates and multiplayer on order to have it.

Audica (a similar game at the same price) has all these things and is also has more polish specifically for the Quest (like advanced haptics). Not to mention a much better selection of free music.

You can seriously tell the amount of effort that these amazing developers put into making the gameplay of this game fluid and feel absolutely perfect.

2022-05-24 15:20:02.272952,"I’ll start off my review by saying that Beat Saber in itself is a great game. Super fun, good for exercise, great for showing friends. There are very few bugs, and both multiplayer and solo options are provided for a full experience. If you’re on the edge, I would go ahead and buy it! I don’t believe you’ll regret it and there’s always the refund option. Beat Saber is probably the most recognized VR game, and for good reason! I’m gonna say some negative stuff down below, but overall my opinion of Beat Saber is quite high.

That being said, a lot of the mapping is hot garbage. There are some fun packs- Camellia is challenging and interesting, Vol. 3 is bouncy and fun, and the Extras are pretty well done too. But there are other packs, especially the ones that you have to buy, that are just not worth it at all. The newly released mixtape pack has some good songs, but it’s all ruined by fairly lazy mapping with no interesting patterns whatsoever. The same goes for a few of the other packs, and as a result, very few of them are worth the purchase. 

This leads us to modding, which I would encourage everyone to try. It’s a free option that allows you to access a huge library of songs mapped by members of the community- much higher quality than the in-game packs, and free of charge to boot. So all in all, I encourage you to buy beat saber- its an amazingly simple concept that takes VR to its fullest potential. However, don’t be drawn into to the money sinkhole that is the extra packs- instead, try downloading some of the community created maps, and you’ll have a lot more fun. Hope to see you out there slicing it up!",2021年6月4日02:32,4,"Good Concept, Bad Mapping"

So I started playing AFTER the 1.15 update. A month before 1.16 so I played during the 3rd year of the game being FULLY released. Ok now on to the actually review. So Let’s Get Some Ground Work If You Like Country Music Or Old Style Music This Game Isn’t For You. But If You Like Rap, Pop, k-pop,  and Electronic. Then this game IS for you. And if you like imagine dragons. So before the 1.15 update the game was already insane and I played it for hours on end trying to get better and better at the game. But the 1.16 update has its pros and cons let’s start with the pros: 2 NEW MAPS, a entirely new music pack, and we finally got a piece of PC VR graphics. Ok now the cons: The new graphics update drags on the performance and the battery life. And that’s it over all if you haven’t already bought the game then you should buy it, it is such a unique game and you should give it a try.

2022-05-24 15:21:14.797621,You can't have VR and not have beat saber. Its great for breaking a sweat and having tons of fun. The game just makes you feel the music at a different level.,2021年6月26日07:43,5,A must have VR game

2022-05-24 15:21:14.927319,This game is so much fun. Only wish they would add to the campaign. Aside from that it's probably the game I play the most on my Quest 2,7月4日09:18,4,Great Game
2022-05-24 15:21:14.970041,"This is my go-to game when I pick up my Quest, either for a full night or as a warm up for another game. It’s fantastic!

2 things I wish the devs would looks at;
Firstly, please add more tracks! Even as DLC. The game is crying out for some actual rock music, just look at the playlist for the likes of Guitar Hero series. I guarantee you’ll make more from downloads than the licensing will cost!

Secondly, why on earth do friends high scores not have icons to show what modifications they used? Playing unknowingly against someone who used fast mode for an extra 10% is a bit annoying. It makes the scoreboard pointless as we don’t know if it’s even possible with our settings... please fix!",2021年5月15日21:35,4,Almost perfect!

1. Its fun to play multiplayer 
2. Your family can play it too and its easy to learn


The bad things are..

1.its kinda expensive
2.if you play multiplayer you cant talk to the people

Maybe you could add voice chat and some good songs because i dont really like the songs right now they are kind of boring sometimes and i played them too much so beat saber is getting boring.
But after all you should really get this amazing game its a nice starting game :)",2021年5月27日14:55,5,Amazing game but..

The sights and sounds, the animations of the blocks and sabres fascinated me so much that an hour had passed before l noticed the time fly. 

I have limited physical ability but the settings allowed me to compensate for that once l new how to use them and since they have added the social dynamic, l have had some quality time with my family thanks to this game which has been really important during our restricted times. 

I would recommend this game to everyone, young or old because it really is one if the best experiences out there. God bless the developers and everyone involved in making things like this possible 🙏 

If l had one wish, it would be that more music packs covering the different decades where available because it would only complement an already delightful experience and it would certainly be something that l would be prepared to pay for.

2022-05-24 15:52:04.209940,"Beat Saber is somewhat fun, but relative to other games out there like Synth Riders and Pistol Whip (which are much better) I find myself somewhat disappointed. Firstly it never goes on sale and doesn't include that many songs, so it generally is overpriced. Second, the music is not that great and DLC packs contain music that is not interesting to me. Levels mostly feel the same. I mostly use these games for exercise, and I find I get much less of a workout with Beat Saber than I do with Synth Riders, which gives utilizes a much fuller range of motion. Harder difficulties are mostly hard because they require memorizing sequences, not because they work your body more. Finally it is difficult to use custom songs or other mods on the Quest version, whereas other games support custom songs out of the box. I'm not returning it because it's still some variety to mix into my workouts, but it could be so much better.",2021年6月15日01:05,3,Somewhat disappointing

2022-05-24 15:52:35.438388,I’ve had this game on other VR’s for about 2 years and after having this for like 4 months on quest I have to say quest is one of the best platforms for this only because of the controllers and no wires mainly because controllers are comfortable and your not hitting wires every five seconds. Also the only problem I ever have is my saber floating away for a second or so in the middle of an expert + mission causing me to fail it which is because of you move your hand to fast the headset throws a tantrum and doesn’t track your hands until there still again I’ve lost many levels I was close to beating because of this. Other than that this is a 5 star because out of all my games this one never gets boring with me and the only time this game gets boring is if you don’t try and push your limits or just play the campaign.,2021年5月24日02:32,5,Sheeeesh

Other than that, I would recommend Beat Saber and, have fun!",2021年5月21日02:37,5,Great game!
2022-05-24 15:53:27.394833,The game is absolutely amazing but unlike the pc edition for beat saber you can not change the look of the sabers. I really want to see custom saber’s in the game and maybe a reword system like you get a free item to customize your sabers or aviator after finishing a song.

2022-05-24 15:53:48.085588,"When I first got this game I was really excited. I had bought it on my quest 2. I loaded it up and played the default songs, but soon I found out that I couldn’t do custom songs that other people made which was the main reason I bought beat saber. After finding out I could not play custom levels the game became less motivating to play. I started to get bored of replaying the same levels and then I just lost the spark. Please add the custom songs into the game so I have a reason to play again. The like... 20 songs that you can play don’t make up for the hundreds of mod songs I wanted to play. Plus I don’t want to have to download a bunch of software in order to get the mod! Please let custom songs/custom song making into the game. The game would be much more enjoyable.",8月30日00:02,4,Fun but... not anymore.

Made buy players who play the game, buying separate packs is really not worth it , too much money for a few songs when some people might just want one song from the whole pack. Just like in my other reviews I said you should invest in a silicone headband instead of the foam one that comes with the Oclulus. You should, you are going to sweat, and it is not fun putting on your Oculus after your friends and feeling that moistness across you face. Also please make sure people put on the straps or your controllers will go flying. One last thing is to have room and time..... You are not going to want to play on one song, and also you are going to move around more than you think so.

2022-05-24 15:54:50.592932,"I love rhythm games and miss the likes of guitar hero etc, where the controllers enabled a more immersive feel to “playing” the songs. Fast forward one hundred years and I here I am slashing away at and dodging blocks in a way that feels so natural, it’s easy to forget where I really am. The gameplay feels flawless and seems well supported by the devs, with both updates and extra content which is sometimes free. I also love the leaderboards, which keep you coming back for more.

The only (minor)disappointment I have is that the environment, though impressive on first play, doesn’t really change throughout the game. Also, there aren’t many tunes that really capture my interest, though clearly a lot of people love the soundtrack. This certainly doesn’t detract me from playing though and this game really is a joy and the arcade nature of being able to play in short bursts is well suited to VR. 

I’d say this is a great starting place for anyone who just got into VR, or is looking for a rhythm game. It’s value for money and I imagine I’ll be playing this as long as I own the quest 2.",2021年6月3日17:05,4,Hard to beat...
2022-05-24 15:54:50.637849,"Amazing rhythm game, a must have if you ever loved Dance Dance Revolution. 

The biggest gripe that I and my fellow new-to-VR friends have is that the difficulty spike is rough at first. Easy to Normal is a relative jump but Normal to Hard is a very accurate way of putting it and then Expert is really quite difficult. 

Not in a way that is utterly impossible but it takes a long time to adjust to the intensity. They do offer modifications to help you though (IE: No Fail Mode, Slower Song Mode, etc).

Anyways I counted down the hours till school ended and I bought it. I DID NOT REGRET IT. More than 100 hours into this game and have not got a millimetre bored of this game!

But the only down side is I think this game needs more songs, or the custom song browser like the pc version of beat saber. Anyways that's the only thing that I'm disappointed in.

*make walls anywhere with the minimap

Having to pay for additional (also not my cup of tea) songs, with this set, feels like a rip off.

Also there is no way for me to get low enough in some levels and look ahead.
I even tried setting player height to 2.5m, but this seems to have 0 effect.
I cannot believe that not more people run into this,
but it really puts a limit on my enthusiasm.
I mean, a deep squat should be enough, in my opinion.
Really wish I ran into this issue before my 2hour playtime.

Other then that, it is still pretty nice game.

For 4 stars, it would need to fix the height issue.

I’d never heard of the game and was hesitant but gave in to it and bought it...I beat my first level and immediately this game found my competitive and addicted side

So I began playing more and more until I found myself at the peak of my achievement where all songs were beaten...UNTIL OST 4 my boundaries were found when I played them, they are difficulty incarnate but in the end I beat them.

But what I’m trying to say is the game is brilliant and the songs are amazing, if your reading this you should buy the game at the expense of getting sore arms after like 10 songs 

P.S devs, I wanna say a huge thanks for making the game but...could we Maybe get voice chat in multiplayer? Or a purchase-able custom song finder for quest 2 players without a PC?

Beat Games knows this because a long time ago they promised to implement a way to load custom songs on the quest.
But this was before the dark times. Before the aquisition.
So, every time you see a 5 star review with the words ""custom songs"", remember that they only exist through a mod, that breaks every update (so you must NOT update when it becomes available until the mod is fixed) and that anytime beat games (or it's owner) can close the door.

They would have a bigger base and larger audience if they opened up this basic feature. Unforgivable policy decision demands a 1star rating.,2021年4月4日02:40,1,No family app sharing.
2022-05-24 15:58:38.901661,Please add more sabers the old original sabers are getting boring and not a lot of people have PCs to get mods so I beg you to add more sabers and also add more free songs I get really bored of playing the same songs over and over other then that great game,2021年5月11日13:59,5,Add more sabers and songs please

2022-05-24 15:58:49.429567,"Really fun, love that you can choose different complexity levels for every song. The colors and graphics are great, really feels like you're a freaking bada$$ on a platform killing colorful squares. The pictures in the app store don't do the game justice. 

Biggest issue I have is that I am basically limited to the three music packs I bought. I don't really enjoy much of the preloaded music. Of the music packs that became available with a recent update, I really only like three of them so I end up doing the same Panic, Imagine Dragons, and Green Day songs over and over. I like some electronic music similar to a few of the preloaded songs, but more dubstep than what is available. Would love some Skrillex or Bassnectar, more rock, or some 80's/90's. The other thing I don't like is how little your lower body moves.

Edit: I found some features I have apparently overlooked for the past month and a half. There is a very challenging 360 degree version, and a 90 degree version. Freaking blew my mind and scared me to death when I started the 360. lol It's pretty freaking kewl. However, I'm leaving it at 4 stars instead of 5 until they figure out how to do additional new songs or music packs more frequently. Totally willing to pay for them.",2021年5月26日15:26,4,"Great game, needs more mainstream music"

2022-05-24 15:58:59.659361,"So I’d heard about this game long before my oculus came in the mail, and after I’d saved up the somewhat pricey 30 dollars to get this game, I bought it. I’m not very good yet, but I can see lots of precious... irreplaceable time... gone to this game. This game is everything you would want in a vr experience. The graphics are next level, and the gameplay is phenomenal. Not only that, but the soundtrack is insane as well. I listened to it before I got the game, and thought it was decent. But when you experience the music the way beat saber let’s you experience it, it’s 100 times better. If you couldn’t tell by now, I highly recommend this game, and wouldn’t return it for double the money I payed. Unless I could buy it again... because then it’s a free 30 bucks... but you understand my point. Anyway, 10/10.

Coming back 2 months or so later. Im on expert plus levels and I’m still obsessed

Just a suggestion for beat saber devs it’d be pretty cool to put some NCS music in the game since most of the music is electronic I thought some of that would be super cool to play",2021年4月16日13:32,5,THE. BEST.
2022-05-24 15:58:59.705210,"When I got the Oculus, I didn't expect the added benefit of getting a workout. This game makes me work up a sweat! My legs were sore from the squats and I could feel the workout in my shoulders and arms the first few times I played. Ramping up the difficulty really gets you moving! Beyond any of that, it's just fun to play. Wielding light sabers is always a good time.",2021年5月2日06:34,5,My favorite game so far

Games like Rocket League don't require you to purchase additional music so not sure why the developers of Beat Saber would do that. I understand that the music artists need to make money as well but let's be honest, who wants to jam Green Day on Beat Saber or Imagine Dragons? Pshhhhh.",2021年5月7日05:11,3,Great game but...

2022-05-24 15:59:20.529674,"This game really needs custom songs support. 

Even if you buy the add ons, they're not even close to the amount of maps that the community could make. Also WTF this game costs 30$ and you're asking for people to buy dlc?! What about teens that don't have jobs? 
Even if my favorite artist was in the DLC I doubt I would waste the money on it, when I can use the money to buy other games.

Just add custom songs support already!! People are asking for it for YEARS. And I know there are ways to download a modded version but some people prefer to use the normal, legal app.

If you would add custom song support, you could moderate the songs people would be able to upload maps to. 
Incase there's a problem with licenses, you could prevent people from uploading maps to certain songs.

Please. Add custom songs support. You know that would REALLY increase sales for a while.
When the update for custom songs comes out, that would drive a LOT of attention to the game for a sudden. And more people would buy it.

Also you could make extra money by making it a DLC= ""Custom songs support"" DLC or something of the sort.",2021年4月25日15:07,3,"Pretty fun, but.."

I can't even really explain why it's so addictive, it just is so much fun. I'd highly recommend playing with headphones for an more immersive experience.  I also love that you can customize the colors and play online with others. Campaign mode is also a good mode to have to get you more familiar with the different types of game play setups.

The only things I wish are that there were more DIVERSE songs in the library and songs with lyrics. But I understand that the lyrics can get complicated with licensing but hopefully they get it soon. But they can certainly include more diverse beats. Also I wish there was a way to create custom songs & maps in app and try others without having to basically bootleg a version of the app that can do it. But I highly recommend this app",2021年5月17日08:59,4,Love!!

Now you can mod the game but that puts you at the risk of being slammed with the ban hammer. For the love of God add custom songs because all these song though fun are not worth 30$ without custom songs. I know it's possible because onward did it they have custom maps built in so what the hell happened here.

If they had shared it, Facebook would have had increased revenue from the sale of DLC on the secondary account.

So, you have to rebuy the game for $30, and any add ons, for everyone in your household to use them under their own accounts, with their own stats etc... even on the same device. Since I owned BeatSaber on the Rift, before getting a Quest 2, I begrudgingly bought it again on Quest recently, with the expectation that when app sharing came, my wife could use it too. BeatSaber was even the app many news outlets have as an example when they reported on app sharing coming to Quest. But, they actively opted out of. My wife still can’t play it on my Quest except under my profile/Facebook account. I was not about to pay for everything a 3rd time. This is absurd.

I'm talking abt the ability to customize how your Saber looks not just by Color but by changing the handle or changing how the trail follows. Or by adding the ability to do tricks without the risk of breaking something. What I mean by this is using a button to like spin your saber or being able to throw your saber like in vader immortal.

The game is still updating every few months, so new content is almost always on its way. There are only like two things I’d change. I know this is more of a quest problem, but while playing faster song especially, my sabers cut through blocks but they don’t cut and pass by my head. My play space have pretty good lighting, and this still happens regularly. The second thing is really a suggestion. Please add custom songs to the game!

This update however has all the blocks coming at me at knee level without a way to fix it.
Missing block constantly on certain maps linken park for example you know your hitting the blocks but they are going straight through the saber.
I thought this was just an issue with quest 1 but no the maps are broken and never been fixed when we are being monopolized into a service I expect these issues to be smoothed out not get worse.
So far I have spent £70 about on this and don't see any point in playing it as the same blocks on the same maps in the same place will not register as a hit.
Please fix it before rolling out updates and dont put it down to tracking as you know it's not.
Update! Turn out rechargeable batteries aren't 1.5v so fixed some issues, blocks have returned to normal levels, no more crouching. Still was missing blocks with tracking issues so bough a IR light which greatly improves game play but not perfect but this is a quest 2 issue and creators have sorted alot of the issues with broken updates.

This game is the one to own on any major vr headset out there but especially the quest being able to swing, dodge etc without being tethered in wires is awesome!

The challenges, campaign, multiplayer and casual play is so sweet and the free packs/songs are cool slashing away with your light sabers to each beat.. the only thing I dislike about the game is I wish they'd more options for songs to play (now I know about sideload) but I'd happily pay £ for more great tunes for example (Eminem, Metallica etc) classics, punk rock to dance but simply because sideload is an option that's why I'm not giving this 4* just a wish on my end is all.. still pick this one up it you haven't already and if you're still bit curious try out the free demo!!",2021年4月15日00:36,5,The one game to own!!

One night I thought I would just give it a try and most probably return it, however the game proved me wrong. I definitely underestimated how much fun the game is, especially when you play to your favorite custom songs.

Beat saber rapidly became my favorite and most played game by far, and it is definitely a game that I would recommend everyone try.  It also offers a great workout and is great for vr newcomers as it is unlikely to cause any motion sickness .

Definitely worth a 5 star rating",2021年4月13日23:02,5,I was hesitant at first...
2022-05-24 16:04:00.972797,Beat saber is a very good workout game. If you play a lot of beat saber you will 100% lose weight. This game can save people’s lives by just playing it because you can lose weight. This game is also really fun to play and there is tons of levels too start off with and then when you start too play the game a lot and your bored just buy some of the dlc packs. I also didn’t say that there is a campaign mode. This is how you can get better at the game after the tutorial. That’s it there is my review I give this game a 5/5 stars because it is a fun game that can have you lose weight. I think everyone that has an oculus device should at least try beat saber one day while playing VR. And one last thing I recommend modding it when the new version of bmbf comes out so you can play custom song and mods.,2021年4月14日04:39,5,Beat saber is a good game.

I've done almost all the expert levels and have been working on a few expert+ at no rush over several months. Though I may get that level eventually, do I really want to move that fast anyway? I'm not that competitive. I've noticed my reaction time has decreased and arm strength has increased. I play an average of 7-8 songs a session.

Playing a song on 90• angle hard mode is interesting. changing your cube/saber/lane colors and avatar customization is a nice touch as well. Also if any devs read this, I think adding unlockable variants of saber effects and or hilts would make a nice addition. Maybe throw in some extra avatar outfits and hairstyles as well 😬 just please don’t abuse it with micro transactions 😅",2021年4月8日13:23,5,Best Game On Oculus

Some IDM or Drum'n'bass would be great. Maybe some indie or alt (Green Day and Linkin Park are all you can get in that avenue: more cheese).

A lot of the other songs are just a lot of noise, can’t imagine how you’d dance to these in person or on a club, or why you’d want to dance to these.. definitely needs some more catch dancy floor fillers.

The games graphics are incredible, some of the best VR graphics I’ve ever seen in my life, and on the Quest 2, forget about it, the graphics get even better on the new Oculus Quest, which I didn’t even know was possible.  And I also understand why some people bought this game for exercise.  At the highest difficulty, Expert+, it can get really fast paced.  And try combining their built in Camellia soundtrack (my favorite soundtrack) on Expert+, it can get incredibly fast, to the point where my muscle memory got 5x better just by playing ONE EXPERT+ song.  Some people say that they needed to enable developer mode and install a BMBF just to get the full experience of Beat Saber, and I cannot tell you how wrong they are.

I’m sure lots of ppl like BTS but plenty have no idea who they are. Does Monstercat even count as legit premium releases?

Beat Saber is owned by Facebook/Oculus. So why has it been decided that Beat Saber cannot be shared socially on the one headset? It's not a shared app on my headset at the time of writing.
That flies in the face of what has been said and acknowledged.

I'm sure if she could play under her OWN account that she would be proud to see her hi score, remembering she kick this ole mans butt...

I can understand one copy Per HEADSET, but not Per USER!!!

Hopefully they will fix the issue soon. It's already a HUGE money maker, no need to gouge us. She had 5 in the family. WE can't afford FIVE COPIES, and shouldn't have to. I'm the one that buys the two headsets, two programs, etc... Isn't that enough?

It would be nice if they let us know it WILL happen, so we don't remain ticked off and fuming every time we play and think of it.

They need to also allow the playing on our own music. We shouldn't have to be forced to pay for limited music packs or PAY TWICE FOR SONGS WE ALREADY OWN through iTunes, Amazon, or others. 

Maybe they need to become a music reseller or resell for others and get the profit that way. Prolly be even more profitable in the long run. 

Hey, if Real VR Fishing can allow playing our own music, Beat Saber should be able to allow it as well. We can see it's possible, as it's seen on many YouTube videos. So, there's already the ability to do it.

2022-05-24 16:07:28.947186,"I bought Beat Saber at end of January. I played it few times until 3rd march. Nothing special. It's just a rhythm game with good music.

To be honest, it wasn't that addictive for me but then I Turned On Oculus Move.

I used to play the game on Normal difficulty. I played for an hour and burned 450 calories. I was kind of impressed. I didn't have the silicon cover so my Face Cover was just wet for the next 10 hrs. I ordered the Silicon cover.

On 3rd March, I started playing the game on Normal and was able to complete one of the levels on Expert while playing the campaign. Same day. Burned 1000s of calories.

Since then I have burnt around 21,000 calories playing beat Saber. On average I play for around 1 hr and 30 mins everyday.

If there was no Oculus Move, I might not have gotten into Beat Saber like others. Now, it's a game about getting Full Combos on Expert for me. Learn the tricks to start with Expert+ (it's almost impossible).

Maybe the most addictive game on Quest. I'm someone who loves Half-Life Alyx, The Witcher 3, God of War, The Last of Us, Ghost of Tshushima, Spiderman, Horizon: Zero Dawn, A Plague Tale: Innocence etc. I wasn't expecting to get into Beat Saber but now I understand the hype.

I have all the song packs. It's not enough. Modding on Quest 2 feels risky even though it might not be. The recently released OST 4 has some of the best music but 4 songs only. How long can you listen to them? I love them but it's just 4.

The first game I got for it was beat Saber, by far the game with the most play time! I know I can’t compare but the graphics + frame rate￼￼ are great and run smoothly. 

The only time I have experienced drops was when i brought the quest 2 round my dads ( his internet is not great) ￼and tried casting, apparently the cast on my phone was smooth but my game was jumpy and the frame rate derailed off a cliff, it made me feel sick and gave me a headache. 


The neon visuals fit the sound track well for the vanilla and the optional paid for music packs and the game play is very satisfying to get right. Some of the songs can get very challenging but the more you play the better you get.

The multiplayer is fun to jump in to a quick play and cool to play with friends but I do have some gripes with it. Like sometimes I join a lobby with nobody in it, and the other players sometimes glitch out? I don’t know what it is, sometimes a player just starts going crazy  flailing their arms about at unbelievable speeds, then we start playing the song and the player is still going bonkers but still playing the song at the same time￼? It’s very confusing.

In my opinion Beat Saber is a great starting game and accessible to all ages with fun and literal endless gameplay. 

(Edit,I don’t think I sold my ideas that well so I rewrite this paragraph.)
￼￼￼￼
These are things that I think could work well in another future update, a tournament mode in online and add a way to level up also to look at your stats. (Online) Big ask but a built in chart maker where you can put your own creative twist on existing songs in game and upload your ￼￼￼levels to the online.",2021年4月1日03:25,5,I highly recommend this game!👍

The negative twist though is that it lacks the most basic functionality - Custom Songs. You can only play the limited originals, which gets boring after a while. I know that for PC there's a big community and tons of customs, but it requires a modded version of the game, which isnt something I'd like to do. Instead of going around you should just include the custom songs function (can be a paid DLC, I wouldn't mind spending extra 10-20 bucks to be able to explore player made content) to make your game fully enjoyable for years.",2021年4月27日00:01,4,"Must Have for Quest, but with a twist."

Keep in mind that installing mods/custom-songs on the Quest version violates Facebook's Terms of Service (ToS). They haven't banned anyone's accounts for it, but that could change in the future.

Edit: I lower this rating down to a 8/10 mainly due to a big while playing where your saber could phase through a block for no apparent reason and at any time, it really ruins the aspect of when your just about to finish a song and you miss one otherwise this issue can be overlooked if your in it for a good time on vr",2021年4月2日16:15,5,Amazing game
2022-05-24 16:08:20.934983,"Ost4 pretty much defines beat saber. Honestly you could cut out all the other songs and only have the 4 ost4 songs and it would still be an amazing game. But in all seriousness time for the real review. First off ignore easy and normal mode they are slow and boring, hard is the real easy mode, expert is normal and expert+ is hard mode. The game has a wide and diverse range if songs, (we dont talk about tiny tan aka BTS) the game allows you to twiddle with many settings to make yourself comfortable. The online is great and has a large amount of people playing (mics are turned off so you can concentrate on the songs) the only real problem with the game so far are the sabers, tbh they are comedically big in a very bad way. So if you’re interested buy the game, tell your parents, tell your friends, tell the government, tell the military, tell everyone. And if you don’t like it... 



Well why wouldn’t you? Either then that or play Gorn or something. 

Ok bye",2021年4月4日06:20,5,New update is amazing
2022-05-24 16:08:20.983853,"This was the first game I downloaded when I got the Quest 2. I played it at my friends and was hooked! I love the different songs and options available, like disappearing arrows and the ability to make the songs faster. I also like the options to purchase other playlists. I thinks it’s a great idea to have that availability. 

Would like to see more beat maps at the normal and hard levels for the 360* game play option. There’s only a select few songs at those levels, and the others are at expert(+) -- which is still only a handful of songs options anyway. 
Would also be fun to have some classic songs as a play list, specifically I’m thinking some Michael Jackson songs. I love the high energy of the electronic music, but would like to see some classic songs on a playlist in the future. 

This game is so much fun and I look forward to more updates :)",2021年3月30日03:05,5,So much fun!

I haven’t got to a point when I don’t want to play this game. I would definitely recommend!

I just have one request, to the best saber devs i think it would be great to add some juice wrld songs to the game or maybe a community tab that doesn’t require a mod. It would make the game even greater and i feel like it would add more people that could play their genre of music and not be limited. 

Overall this is a great game and a must have in my opinion, if you are on the edge, download the demo and you’ll be hooked. I promise!",2021年3月27日14:19,5,Love this game!
2022-05-24 16:10:04.781962,"I can’t believe that family sharing is unavailable here. And when I click online play in my oculus quest, there’s no response at all, though I’ve updated to the latest version. Deeply disappointed.",2021年4月5日20:27,1,No family sharing!

2022-05-24 16:10:15.219190,"I have no words for how good this game is. I have played it throughout 2020 - 2021 and it’s great! This game gives you extra songs even when you start the game. There are songs like Crab Rave and FitBeat, ohhhhhh FitBeat. FitBeat is a track that I have definitely played the most. I’m horrible at playing it because I’ve only gotten to S playing it on hard. Beat Saber is a great game for the starter player on VR for the first time, it’s also great for people who have played VR a lot.",2021年3月23日03:37,5,This game. Wow.
2022-05-24 16:10:15.268049,"So I want to say at first that I love Beat Saber, easily my go-to game. However the devs or publishers(honestly I’m a bit thick in the skull and don’t really know the entire process of releasing a game)
seem pretty money hungry. No custom songs whatsoever, music packs are a little pricey on top of a 30-40$ price tag, and in multiplayer lobbies if everyone picks a song you don’t own you can’t play(you can’t even hear the song while spectating!!) Also there’s this bug that constantly happens every single time I play where my sabers will just pass through blocks multiple times per level. Edit: I have now bought the Imagine Dragons and the Green Day music packs. Honestly a little disappointing levels are super easy to the point of me almost getting a full combo on expert+ on every song first try. The devs also don’t seem to understand flow or rhythm, for instance on Breezer beats are just out of sync and it seems some parts of songs are in-sync and some aren’t. An improvement I think could add to the game and help others learn the songs is to have easy start super basic and then have normal and above add little things and make more and more of the notes be manual so you can basically still see the basic easy mode song underneath all the other notes. I don’t really know if anyone reading gets what I’m saying but what I mean is they don’t just change the song between difficulty’s. Edit: I bought the MonstercatxRocket League pack and it’s definitely one of the the best, if you get any song packs buy the Monstercat ones first. Also, the new OST4 is good it’s definitely the best out all the original sound tracks. BS is really fun game with good graphics and a great concept, but it isn’t amazing or awful just good. Would recommend but not as highly as other reviewers.",2021年3月23日05:40,5,
2022-05-24 16:10:15.317538,"This game is freaking awesome. Not only is it fun, but it’s a great workout. It offers a ton of different difficulty options which is great for enhancing your hand I coordination. The music is great however I look forward to them getting more purchasable albums from￼ more artists. They do offer a lot of free music so it is definitely worth the $30.￼",2021年3月26日23:27,5,What else can be said!!!
2022-05-24 16:10:25.542399,"It's one of those games that will probably remain relevant for years to come and be considered a classic. If you don't mind doing some phisical exercise, this is probably gonna be the game you'll always return to when you finish or get bored by other vr games. In this case it's probably a must buy! The replayability of this game can be endless. 5/5* for making aerobic fun for me. I'm afraid not to infringe some terms and conditions so I haven't tried to mod it on my oculus quest or to add custom songs. I hope for an official way to add the stuff that modders do on quest 2, those meme songs I've seen on YT looks really fun

P.S. if you play for the first time be careful with the expert/expert+ levels. They're more demanding then they might seem! Start with the campaign or easy/normal songs and work your way up. Expert+ songs+ no fail modifier on the first day it's a no-no, trust me! If you get sore muscles or wrists pain, take a break for few days and let the body recover, then get back on slashing blocks. It can be a healthy game only if you don't overdo it",2021年3月23日04:53,5,A classic
2022-05-24 16:10:25.592299,"So, I have a windows mixed reality vr headset for my pc that I just love, being wireless the quest 2 had me interested however with covid going on and losing my job because of it I couldn't get it till now. So I have played a lot of VR games and there are some I want to play but can not because it gives me mad motion sickness.  Single player games such as story's in VR don't offer long enough game play for the price personally so I avoid them. Stinks that the quest is so limited on games.

Beatsaber is still better on pc because of mods and players making tons more music available for this game, the limited music for this game with how long its been out stinks, it took them 2 to 3 years to start adding more but in dlc form.   Beat Saber is the only single game I keep coming back to even though I am absolutely sick of the music it has to offer, it's fun and offers more then an hour or 2 worth of gameplay.  It doesn't give any type of motion sickness at all bit the biggest downside is really the limited songs it has.",2021年3月26日16:32,5,The best VR game out there still!

2022-05-24 16:10:36.037594,"So this is my review after playing it for more than a year I'd say. I have gotten better at the game and I can now beat Expert+ and like most of the camellia songs like light it up, what the cat, and exit this earth's atmosphere, and Cycle hit, Ghost is next for my check list. Anyways what this game brings me is sweat and awesome gameplay! U swing away with your sabers to hit the notes that are coming towards u along with the beat of the 🎵 songs. It gets harder as u go up in difficultys and the most important thing I'd enjoy the music that were made for the game. One thing to note is that linkin park and imagine dragons are in the game. My favorite type of music Rock and pop I think.
In conclusion this game was a bit too much for me to work with but in the end it doesn't even matter 🙃
I got so far and I got really good at the game. The hardest songs I have beaten are overkill and Given up.
If u don't have this game get it, u will like it and get moving/active!

UPDATE! The new songs that were added to the game
are alright for a free update. I tried them all on ExpertPlus and they are faster then the ones I'm used to. So far I liked them for the music but the mapping ehhh, I don't really like the mapping too much. It all happens way to quickly within like 1 min of the song and I get tired after a while. Like who doesn't get tired after playing one ExpertPlus song. Always take a break after playing for a good 3 mins. In conclusion, I like the new update and I think the mapping could be more improved if it wasn't too fast with some of the songs. Anyways I did play them with my friend after I told him another update was here and he liked ludicrous+ because of course it sounded electric or something.",2021年3月21日21:40,5,Beat saber is the best Game!!

2022-05-24 16:11:07.344868,"I will try to resume the Pros and Cons of this Game:
Pro:
 Game play: Amazing, makes you move cutting blocks that come at you, with the rhythm of the song.
 Movement: The sabers work very well, you can define your height so the game will adapt to you, and it also forgives some cuts that are not very good, which is good, because your gonna near miss some.
Training: This game will make you sweat.
Difficulty: You enter into a music in practice mode and reduce the speed of the level to train, or start at a specific point in the music.

Cons:
Music: this game is not cheep, and it comes with a very limited number of songs, sure you will find music for your taste that will make you cut some cubes, that I can assure everyone, for me the problem is that only 7/8 music's motivate me to play this game.
Bundles: Very few are available, Be aware music's are censored with bip's and mutes, and for me that completely kill it (Green Day and Linkin Park for example) and tis not announced anywhere.
Some bundles that would make sense in this game, Avicii, David Guetta, Hardwell, Calvin Haris, so so many Sum 41, Blink 182, My Chemical Romance, Prodagy, Muse, OffSpring",2021年3月31日05:11,4,Could be 5 Stars

I buy new VR games regularly but I always put beat saber in and play anyway. It’s just soo much FUN!! And I feel like I’m moving more and getting some exercise too!

If I were to request improvement it would be that I really want to make friends directly within the game. If you find a compatible player online, it would be nice to be able to select in game, send a friend request and, in addition, being able to party up from there would be awesome!

The one thing that is a con is that you have to buy the add ons for the music you actually recognize if you aren’t familiar with the songs that they have free with the game, it’s pretty expensive, but overall a good game. And also me and my friend always talk about how we wish they had like a mode that you can add your own music in or create your own levels with your own music too.
Given that it is a bit of an expensive game though I suggest if you decide to get it or the add ons for it to do it while they are on sale, especially since they go on sale quite often.",2021年3月22日04:18,5,All the hype you’ve heard is true.

However in this new update there is a lot of overlapping of the text in game (the scores and grades overlap on one side and in the other side the streak and time overlap). Other than that its a brilliant game - would love some more albums to be made available, and maybe some more tracks added to the panic at the disco album!",2021年3月18日00:06,5,A couple of glitches but still amazing
2022-05-24 16:12:09.606351,"For anyone that is looking for a game that is fun, exciting, and something that can burn calories, get Beat Saber! Beat Saber was the first game I ever installed and I love it! I am a person that likes rhythms a lot and I find this game very rhythmic and I really enjoy it. Me and my whole family enjoy this game and I would recommend this game to someone who doesn’t get dizzy or nauseous easily. My family did not have a problem with being nauseous or being dizzy and that surprised me because one of my family members normally get motion sickness and can get dizzy pretty easily. 

I am very impressed Beat Saber. Keep up with the good work and the helpful updates!",2021年6月24日12:33,5,My Favorite Game

2022-05-24 16:12:09.704618,"I end the day with running a couple songs in BS. Tracking on the quest2 is great, although glitchy at times, especially if you wear a sweatshirt (weird). It would be better if there was a way to do user added songs and not lose scoring. 

I like the official songs because the variety is there. Not everything has to be seizure inducing 300bpm. Being able to hand the game off to my kid and let her have a go on easy and normal is great. 

This is a great first game, and would be great to be packaged with the system. 

Devs! Lets see more metal. Can we get a Fear Factory pack?

Update: something I didn't know about this, if you purchase an add-on pack, you better like it because Facebook will not refund bundles. Bought it Linkin Park pack, it's uninspired, slow songs trying to feel fast, and the environment inside the game is a concrete tunnel. Woo.",2021年3月20日06:44,4,My evening workout

Hello readers
The problem stated below have been resolved and so now I will highly recommend this product because I genuinely love the game and the problem was dealt with very quickly.

Previous review listed below:
Okay this is a game you can definitely play for exercise and for fun it's an amazing app.this game is definitely worth the money and time. But like everything has it's good things and it's bad things and recently you guys just did a huge update and messed with the height calibrations so now I'm too freaking tall and I can barely hit anything anymore and I'm at an expert level so if I can't hit anything something's wrong somewhere. Until this there was not a bad thing I could say about  this app other than the fact that you can't use Bluetooth without the maps glitching and I could deal with that because I could still play. So if you could fix those two problems I'd be happy to continue playing your app and continue to buy your products heck I even change this rating to a five star so please help a girl out",2021年3月17日07:05,5,my review after one and a half years

I think that oculus quest 2 users who don’t have a computer like me, should be able to have at least 1 or 2 different savers to chose from. I get really bored with the sabers I have which are really plain and no depth added to them. Just kinda flat.

As you may know, many people mod their beat sabers in the hope of getting custom songs, sabers, blocks or walls (modding on quest is illegal from what I read) which the devs don't want people to do. To prevent this, the devs should add a custom songs tab, with all custom songs available, and a sabers+ tab for the rest which could be limited to certain sabers, blocks or walls. Another thing I find is with the hard expert+ songs, my legs start shaking after I've finished the song, now I don't know if this is just me or if others are experiencing this too but it's annoying 😭.

2022-05-24 16:14:14.431699,"I'll list the features you'd expect from any rythm game and that are missing from the most popular paid VR rythm game in 2021.

First, the minor problems. The campaign teaches you how to miss instead of introducing you to the accuracy system. This accuracy system is very cool in my opinion since it adds skill expression and needs to be actively worked on to improve. However the only feedback you have on it is a flying integer after every block you cut. You have to stop paying attention to the game bewteen each block, read a small moving number and substract it from 115 to know how well you cut that block. Usually games have a color system to give instant feedback, or at least have text that reads ""Excellent"" or ""Good"". No replay system.

Now the for the awful problems.

Let's start with the obvious. There are only 10 songs after you pay the game. The rest also has to be paid for. This is why I call this a community based game, as 99.9% of the maps are made by the community. This is similar in osu! and the community loves mapping so everyone is happy. Except that a good community game has mod support. This game doesn't. You have to download 10 unofficial apps and you have to be careful because all of your scores could get deleted next update. You rely on modders staying active to get basic features. Pathetic.

The difficulty levels. There are 5 of them : Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, Expert+. Easy Normal and Hard get useless very soon. After a few weeks I can fc some expert+ maps. This is AWFUL. Usually you get a star system. I can remember when I beat a 4.5* map in osu! for the first time after 3 years of playing. The hype, the adrenaline. Now I can still feel that rush when I play in 5* difficulty and my best play is a 5.8* FC after 5 years. My goal is to one day FC a 6*. In Beat Saber, I FC'ed an expert+ map and now everything is called expert+. It's poor game design. A Camellia map is 10x harder than any base map in expert+.

2022-05-24 16:14:24.899347,The recent update that added the experimental tiny notes and new modifiers broke hit detection for notes. you probably had this problem with the recent update to if your looking here. and this is not me being bad at the game so don't start with that. in the update i am referring to it apparently fixed note hitbox size as it was never the size of the actual object onscreen. from my observation i missed way more notes then i should be (singleplayer and online play) and i tested it with all the ost songs including the new ost 4 pack. not only did i miss notes when i hit them correctly to find my saber goes right through the note but also sometimes just as often the game will say a note was hit incorrectly as if i did a bad cut on a block even though it was sliced with the correct saber and direction. whatever they did messed up something in the game and the devs should either remove that feature from the update or fix the hit detection. as i said im not complaining in this review for being bad or anything like that but more to let people know about an ongoing bug in the game.,2021年3月29日08:13,4,Hit detection needs to get fixed

It’s a great workout for fat people too I’m massive, hopefully if I do an hour of this every night I’ll be less so.

My only gripe is the tracking on the quest 2 can go mega wrong sometimes which is brutally frustrating! 

I don’t think this is BS’s code but limitations on the kit e.g my fat belly blocking the tracking cameras detecting the controllers, BS use a bit of logic to guess the location in such conditions i suspect 

Oculus should create room sensor addons to alleviate this, I suspect the thinnines will be fine.

The recent update didn't want to go through, although tried numerous times. After I believe 6-7th attempt I just thought it will be easier to uninstall and install it again. So I did. Imagine my surprise when the game greeted me displaying: ""Looks like you're new to Beat Saber""... All the progress, achievements, avatars, everything just gone... Why wouldn't it remember my progress. It's not like I deleted my account, I still had music packs purchased, it's just everything else that's gone with the wind... And the reason I have decided to do the update at all is that otherwise it wouldn't allow me to play online... so there's that. And one minor thing - I liked the look and feel of the winners and scoreboard in an online quickplay from before the update. Now it's just so teeny-tiny and you don't even see your score (it's displayed only after everyone's in the lobby again)...",2021年3月27日11:40,4,Update that costed me all progress...

The real issue is that this is one of only a handful of oculus games that isn't enabled for play across multiple profiles on the same headset. So my girlfriend has to play under my profile which means the campaign is already done, all my high scores are already present, so it's not as fun for her because she can't see her own progress.

2022-05-24 16:16:40.338752,Beat saber is the game i play the most. I was at expert+ in just over a month and showed off my skills to my parents and they were shocked I was so good at it 😎. The game is based on muscle memory. It starts u with only a few slow moving blocks at a time then casualty gets faster and with many more blocks in the different difficulties and that helps build your muscle memory as u memorise what u need to do. Good for exercise and very addictive. There are different music packs u can by as well like linkin Park BTS elven the game rocket league etc I've literally bought all of them and I really love them. Hope u have fun with the game.,2021年3月6日07:44,5,Before you buy
2022-05-24 16:16:50.541576,This game is great stock with the $30 first time purchase. Unfortunately you have to pay to play the real songs like the Lincoln Park album and Imagine Dragons. Although they are just about the price of the full album if you were to buy them on the apple iTunes Store it is totally worth it. Playing with songs that are familiar are a whole different experience I find myself dancing and singing to the songs while smacking away at the cool colored blocks.,2021年3月5日15:59,5,Great Game Kinda Pricey
2022-05-24 16:16:50.594144,"We just bought the Oculus and downloaded Beat Saber and we love playing it!  It is awesome that we can play to music from my favorite band, Linkin Park, which makes this game so much more fun to play now.....but it’s disappointing that we have to pay extra for music when we already paid for the game. 

Also, there needs to be way more music. If you could add more rock (maybe Breaking Benjamin, Rise Against, Godsmack, 311) and some rap and hip hop (maybe Eminem, Lil Wayne, Drake, Kanye, Jay-Z) that would make it even better and keep players coming back to play the games!!",2021年3月29日14:52,3,Great game. Need WAY more music!

2022-05-24 16:17:00.928675,"I love parts of this game let me say first off. The graphics are amazing,the way it burns off calories so quickly is amazing and it makes it great for weight loss. However there are a lot of problems that bother me. I wish when you set custom colors there was a save color pallet option so you could use them later. There needs to be more environment choices it gets really stale really fast. Some real world backgrounds would be a nice touch. And the big issue OMG THE MUSIC. Legit read any comment that’s negative 9/10 negative comments about this game are about the music and the company does not give a dam and haven’t for over three years and never will. They release the worst music possible and their Music packs minus the BTS one are artists who where popular over a decade ago. Add a custom song mode so we can play songs from our phones I legit mute the game music and listen to my own while playing it’s that bad. Legit there are so many good electronic,dance,bass songs and this company chooses the worst to promote in their game. Legit if you want song selections email me because your team clearly can’t do it. If it wasn’t for the exercise factor I would delete this game in a heartbeat.",2021年3月25日19:11,2,Good but

They have so much add ons and the game is expensive. If you dont have money, it gets very boring. They should make a feature that lets you download songs for free like how skyrim lets you mod the game without a pc. It would be very nice and maybe charge for the feature.

We need more songs, not just the 4 you’ve added. Not only that, they are not that great. I heard you were bringing songs out and i was looking forward to it. Oh how i was wrong.

Tried again a week later and did OK, so I decided to buy the full game.  Tried a few songs, different difficulty levels, tried some of the modifiers, etc. and just couldn’t get into it.  Decided to try the campaign mode — GAME CHANGER! This mode teaches you everything you need to know about playing this game by progressing you through various tasks and objectives, starting with the most basic moves and concepts through the more advanced levels. In a matter of a day I was rocking out in multiplayer mode and having a blast!  I would highly recommend this game. Only thing I dislike is the lack of songs, and having to buy new ones is kinda lame considering I used to play all the DDR games and they all came with TONS of songs built in, and they were songs you KNOW.  Unless you pay for a premium song pack, you won’t recognize any songs.

In the last couple days however the game has been glitching left and right.  At first I was willing to accept maybe I just was not playing very well and needed to warm up.  However, after a few rounds I started noticing things like what should have been clear slices through the blocks was instead just the saber passing through the blocks as if they were ghost sabers unable to make contact.  More and more I also noticed my saber flapping around like wet pool noodles.  I even tried to hold my hand in many different positions in front of me just in case it was just the exterior cameras not picking up my controllers, even though I had not needed to do this any of the other times I had played.

Now this doesnt make me hate the game; It's a suggestion for anymore to add to the game: Maybe more environments or color sets, and some more song pack variety! I think adding maybe some more pop, rock, metal, 80s, 90s, Jpop, and more.
And my suggestion for a music pack to add to the game I'm sure many will buy is an AJR pack",2021年3月1日11:46,5,Amazing and Fun! But...

You slash boxes with light sabers in the arrows direction. That’s it. I’ve showed this to people that are almost 50 years old and even they liked it. This game is like Mariokart and Nintendo, or Halo and Xbox. It’s a must-have and is literally a system seller. Seriously, before you buy ANY other game that was on your list, get this first. It’s really worth it and it’s AUD$3 (about a dollar in USD) to get a new song that you may have heard on the radio before. 10/10, would play forever.",2021年3月1日23:36,5,Why are you even reading this?

The only recommendation that I have for the developers is to add songs more frequently or add more songs per soundtrack so people don’t have to play the same songs over and over again. Yeah, the devs only added like 5 songs this update. The main question is should you buy Beat Saber? YES! It is totally worth $30. Oh, did I mention it is good exercise?

Yes. That's true. There's also the risk of getting ban. 

You may then ask. ""But no one has been banned!""

Yes. Not yet, they aren't. And if the ban hammer goes off, there would probably be an outcry. So it highly unlikely.

""So what's the problem?"" You ask.

This practice is just shady. The developers (as well as Oculus) want don't want to get call out by the music industry by ""not supporting"" custom songs. But they still sort of allow it to happen by not fully blocking it since they benefit from the community by having them continue to creating new contents for the game and showing off the game with contents that don't actually exist.

The game is exactly the same, great graphics, very immersive and great fun. Different levels of playing from easy to expert+ which seems impossible to me, but I also discovered other fun modes too like 360 and 90 which has them coming at you from different angles. So much fun. You can put the game in different modes too such as party mode where you can challenge people at home sharing the headset, scores kept on a board, and campaign which is great to learn different modes and build up your skills. The music is great too. Great choice. Wouldn't mind some older songs from my era (80s such as Queen) some of those songs like Invisible Man, Breakthru would be fab.

But this OST is my fourth favorite out of the OSTs(ironically),but all I want anymore is a Imagine Dragons song pack 2 it’s all I want from this game MORE Imagine Dragons songs.

2022-05-24 16:19:47.673527,"This game is phenomenal. Enjoyable for any age group and skill level, it's good exercise, helps hand-eye coordination, enough difficulty settings and modifiers etc.
the complaint I have is one among many though; MORE SONGS!!
Have more Beat Saber songs, not just music packs! While I like a few of the music packs, it would suck to spend around $10 give-or-take for songs you don't even like just to have more songs to play.
Even if you had more Beat Saber original songs for like a 3/5 dollar add on, that would be much better than being stuck to SOLELY music packs.
If you're content with a limited amount of songs then absolutely get this game. If not, buy it still bc it's GREAT but know the limitations!",2021年3月17日09:07,4,One of my all-time favorites but...
2022-05-24 16:19:47.726499,"It's fun for the first 10 levels then it gets to a point where it's ""difficulty"" means you can't see the next block cuz the one you are hitting is in the way. Only way to beat the harder levels is to memorize them where in comparable console games you could still beat a level without memorization but then memorizing of course helps with leaderboard scores to compete with others online. Which i think that feature is on here but didn't see where when i was doing solo songs. Maybe what i really want is just rock band instead....not guitar hero. Someone needs to bring rock band back. If you need another VR game that'll kill an hour or two definitely get it. It's also a game to watch evolve with VR.

I’ve been playing for a year and change now and I haven’t gotten bored with the amount of songs they have. Even the difficulty levels ate perfect as it ranges from Easy to Expert +. It’s also an amazing way to get exercise, as some expert plus songs, like FitBeat and Light it Up, are fast paced and force you to move.

From the moment I tried it I was hooked. I psychologically can't leave a session until I have executed it perfectly on my chosen level of difficulty and with full body engagement.   An hour later and dripping with sweat,  this is the most I have moved my body in a year and I am feeling no pain, only addiction and energy.  This is how I now start each day and it's better than coffee. The only problem is not wanting to stop.

You pay over $30 for the game and then have to buy the songs. A rip off! But if you watch a few YouTube videos, you can mod this baby to make it worth your while for free!

The base game music just seems to work with the game more than the DLC, plus with the infrequency that we get music packs, I'm not sure the single band approach works. I'd much rather see genre packs with a mix of music from different artists instead of packs for a single group.",2021年3月11日11:17,4,Good game that needs more variety.

Even after mastering many different songs, it always gives you the feeling to strive further. On top of that, this has greatly improved my reaction time, which has helped me in many others games, vr or not.

this game can be a VERY fun game and also very addicting if your the type, I think anyone should try this game at least once, I play many games and this is definitely an amazing one! 
And since it keeps your heart racing and gives me a habit of trying until I have the score I am satisfied with. You can get really tired physically and can get boring if you play the same song over and over again, so try doing different ones, 

I do recommend trying online since it can be really competitive and fun since it’s not about what you want so you can try different songs each time, instead you vote and get r eady, playing with friends and people are the most fun I’ve had with the game, so if you can please try the game, I hope and bet you will have fun",2021年2月21日13:43,5,Anyone should try

It needs a little bit more spice to it, ya know? Something that will bring back the game for the quest platform.something that will. Bring the community to creativity. Like custom songs and sabers, I know the quests can handle it and it’s very boring how we have to buy songs that are 20 bucks a playlist in order to master it and get bored again. Maybe you can bring custom songs to quest so we don’t have to hookup a pic and download all this stuff in order to play songs that we like.

The songs have a great beat and so it makes moving more fun. It feels like an intense workout! The only complaint I have is that we should be able to pair this with our own library of songs or at least a wider range of songs for us to purchase! I don’t mind purchasing songs within the app that I love, but the selection of songs are very, very limited! If you mod the game then I believe you lose a lot of the basic features. I didn’t want to risk that so now I’m stuck with a few really good songs.",2021年2月19日02:30,5,I’m Obsessed!

Unfortunately the original game fits about 30-40? songs which after you played all of them might get boring. Mods come for the rescue but installing them might not be easy for everyone. I wish the devs added option for custom songs in the future but it probably won't happen because instead they're releasing music packs with a few songs for over 10 $ per pack (profit!) and also adding custom songs is treated as ""piracy"" so probably they don't want to get sued.",2021年2月16日03:55,5,Awesome game...

I don't even know what what makes it so addictive, but it is. The difficulty system always gives you a sense of accomplishment, and keeps the game fresh. The campaign feels fantastic, fresh, and interesting. I never, ever wonder what I'm doing playing this game, I just play it.  I think that beat saber NEEDS custom levels to stay fresh and exciting. To do custom levels you have to install third party software that takes forever, and is a lot of effort. That being said, this game is beautiful and addictive, and just feels like the closest thing to the ultimate quest game out there...  A MUST HAVE!!!",2021年2月15日18:03,5,Love this game!!!

If you want custom songs you can get bmbf which allows you to get custom songs and sabers. The devs have not banned use of these mods because they don’t break the game and they are not hacks. It’s overall a great experience would recommend but it just needs custom songs without having to use a pc to mod the game. I kinda wish it was like the steam version but for the quest it’s a great game! 10/10 would recommend!,2021年2月15日12:11,5,You must get this game!

Maybe even, and I know this is a big thought. Make a custom song browser that works in real time with hotfix patching, so that we can play custom songs once we've Fc'd all of story mode, or just make it so that it isnt a colossal nightmare to use mods because they break with every update of the game.

A couple features I would like to see is custom songs, like in the pc version. I do know about BMBF, but I would like to see them in multiplayer mode, cause if you get BMBF it messes up the multiplayer mode.

Another game mode I would like to see is a  Cooperative mode, where you try and beat the game together.

Also I would like to see custom sabers for instance, katanas or like Thor’s hammer. Something cool like that.

Other than this stuff that they could add, this game is absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend it ,and if you have the money you should buy it.

2022-05-24 16:25:52.614697,"I always say nothing can be perfect. But when I first started this game, and played it, I tought I have found an exception to my quote. However later I discovered that this game, while at first looks perfect, it has some very small issues.
Let's start at the begining: This game only has about 30-ish songs built-in. Once you have played them all. It will get kind of boring. The PC version have custom songs, however without modding the Quest version, it's impossible to have any. And this leads me to my next point: Nope, Crossbuy is not possible with this game. That's why I have bought the PC version on Steam.
And there's my last problem: Collision issues. Many people say it's a thing, others say not. I literraly have Zero tracking issues with my Quest 2, however sometime the game registers a perfectly fine hit as a Miss or a Bad Cut. The funny thing about this is that the PC version is completely fine! I would be happy if Beat Games would investigate this issue a bit more, and they won't just say that it doesn't happen with them.

Overall, I'm going to give this game 5 stars. It feels amazing to play, it's very polished, and as I said, it's almost perfect. There are a lot of music packs that you can buy for the game, if you want to have more amazing songs. And Beat Games said that they are currently working on OST vol. 4. This game is also fantastic for Parties, with it's Party mode, and there's also an Online Multiplayer mode for playing with your friends, especialy in this pandemic. This game is incredible and should have gotten the '2018 Best VR Game' award.",2021年2月13日19:21,5,"Incredible Game, but has some flaws"

Britney spears.. lady gaga popular songs of today.  I don't mind paying for each song I just wish they had any song I could want ! I also don't like that I can't stream beat Saber on live Ike other games as thi is the reason I got a vr. Other than that the game is great!,2021年3月2日12:26,4,Beat Saber is a fun game

That said, the game IS really lacking in content for new players. The music available is great, but is a limited selection and the modded community is both discouraged by the developers and caters to the high end players. The Devs should really release more content for beginners and intermediates - people in their first 10-50 hours of play are a big untouched demo that they seem to be struggling to understand.",2021年3月3日01:28,4,A platform seller!
2022-05-24 16:26:13.412294,"I enjoyed this game a lot. It had me tapping my foot to the beat. I think a lot of the reason is the blocks had meaningful notes in the songs, and it had a different feel in this regard than something like Audiosurf where the beats are autogenerated by the song (at least this is my guess why I enjoyed the game more). 

I did find the mechanic where I have to pay attention to the direction of the blocks to not be related to the musicality of the game... it does add another element of technical difficulty but I found myself paying more attention to the direction of the blocks and less to the music and rhythm, which detracted from my enjoyment a bit. I would prefer an option to turn off the block directionality.

Overall I'm not sure playing this game will change my life, in part because it is not inherently a social game. I am not sure I would rather be playing this game than going kayaking with a friend, or playing Mario Party with a friend. But it definitely got me dancing, which is something I love to do and haven't done as much now that I'm older and don't want to stay out until 4am at the clubs. The game sort of forces you to dance to play.. and you get a lot of those same emotional highs you get when dancing.",2021年5月22日12:18,5,First rhythm game I've enjoyed

2022-05-24 16:26:34.188028,"Beat saber is a really fun and active game. I personally play it almost every day as it gives me something to do and exercise at the same time. But keep in mind that once you play and beat every game, it can get quite boring. I wish Beat Saber already added custom songs in the original game because some people do not have the right equipment to mod it; like myself. 

Overall it has some pretty good songs and I really enjoy it! 

TIPS:

Muscle memory! This game is all about muscle memory. I say this because you have to memorize the maps so you get more and more used to it, it helps beating the level faster

If you’re stuck on for example hard mode, go onto practice mode or play the next level over and over until you get a bit better, then go back hard mode. It’ll help, I personally use this tip all the time, and most professionals do to. 

The next tip will really help: when you have an arrow pointing up for example, the next note will most likely be a note pointing downwards. That’s why it’s very important to use your wrists and not you arms to break the block. Same with the arrows pointing to sides, just like with muscle memory, thisll help a lot. 


Grips for your controllers! : 

Search up some good grips that help YOU. My personal favorite for the oculus controllers is the claw grip, reverse claw grip, and the m. If you start feeling pain, stop immediately and take a break! Especially if your wrists are hurting, you could be using the wrong grip. 

I hope this helped as it personally helped me.",2021年3月1日13:36,4,"Amazing game, BUT"

Let me start by saying that beat saber has fun and addicting gameplay that uses muscle memory to get the job done, the better you get at the game not only do you go up in difficulty but you can start adding in some dance moves as you play. and then there’s the modding community which I won’t go into because it does take some time to set up but once you figure it out it’s really simple. and even though I play with custom songs I always buy the official dlc when they release to support the devs for making such a amazing game.

Finally I got an oculus quest for my birth day and the first game I got was beat saber. There are so many levels and modes and difficulties that you can do. Also they took in mind that if they had one-handed people there is a mode that only requires one hand. Beat saber, still 7 months later is still my most favorite game. (You feel so awesome in the game chopping blocks till your sister videos you and shows it to you.)       UPDATE: The multiplayer mode was such a good update, I stoped playing for a little because it just got boring I tried casting it onto my phone and it worked for the slower easier levels but when I tried to do the harder ones while casting to show everyone I was getting really bad frames and it would freeze every now and then. I get that it’s not the devs fault. Something about winning against other people from all over the place is very satisfying and that’s when I started playing beatsaber more.

Prior, I was up to Expert level for most songs, and now, even if you SEE the saber going through the cube, it registers as a miss. The absolute worst thing about this game now, is the inability to connect with cubes that switch sides, especially when each color switches sides: for example, when the blue cube comes at you from the left, and/or the red from the right, you have to have the wingspan of Gronkowski to hit them. The height level is fine, but the  wingspan of each player is not taken in to consideration. It's like it was only built for tall guys with a huge wingspan.

To avoid this they should support custom songs but don't for obvious reasons. 

Custom songs are not only cheaper but bring much more choice. Every expensive pack offered is modern and most are electro pop. I prefer older rock standards. These are available via the broad BS community.

So my business model is lower reviews until they start offering better value through custom songs. I would encourage you to do the same.",2020年12月28日08:04,1,Money machibe

2022-05-24 16:27:36.917007,I think this game is absolutely fantastic but its a shame the music licensing is all messed up. Why in the $#%! are they going the route of music packs per band. That is terrible. What happened to the games like rockband when they came preloaded with over 100 songs that you knew?? I dont mind paying more for songs but make it a value. Something like 300 songs for $30. Instead its $15 for 10 songs from one band. Thats a bunch of BS. No thanks. I would rather just stop playing and go find some other music beat game to play.  They really need to figure out the music licensing because its going to kill the game. Then they have the nerve to ban people who mod the game with custom songs. Well...you know if you offered a valuable product...there would be no need to mod the game. I just bought the game and I already have no desire to continue to play the game because of this bs. I am going to go try synth riders cuz i hear they have ez custom songs.

2022-05-24 16:28:08.015236,"The vanilla game is great. It has a good amount of songs and game modes to play. Wide range of difficulties for people of any skill level. Multiplayer is also great. And the modded game is even better. I have a modded version, and there is basically an endless amount of songs that I can play. And with Beat Sage, you can play almost any song out there in Beat Saber.",2021年2月8日16:46,5,Great game
2022-05-24 16:28:08.070322,"I would, however, appreciate if you could set the camera distance so that you can see the cubes from farther away. It makes it a bit easier to see where you hit so being able to set the camera a bit farther away from the cubes to hit them easier. Otherwise, this game is a must buy. It’s totally a the perfect party game to pass time.",2021年2月9日10:58,5,It’s nice.
2022-05-24 16:28:08.123395,"This game is just phenomenal. Good songs to choose from, customizable, and just an over all great game to play when you’re bored. But I have noticed some flaws that I think are holding your game back from the potential greatness that it can. One being the micro transactions. There is a very little selection of songs and the most obvious way to get more is buying a music pack. Don’t get me wrong the music packs are great but I just spent $40 on this game, I’d like them to lean less on micro transactions. But besides that this game is just amazing!",2021年2月9日01:00,5,Amazing Game! But...
2022-05-24 16:28:08.177756,"I've been playing this game for around 3 days and I'm already addicted to this game. I play this all the time and at least everyday. This is also a good exercise game for people losing weight or just trying to gain some power. But if you play for a while, you could get sore and I recommend you stretch or take some deep breaths after playing the game. Very fun game, would recommend it.",2021年2月9日08:57,5,Super Fun and Good Excersize
2022-05-24 16:28:08.233347,"I think many developers don’t realize that VR has fascinated many older users, like myself, whom have really enjoyed VR as a whole.  Beat Saber is absolutely a must own on the quest.  I just wish they would give us a 70’s, 80’s or maybe a Michael Jackson pack to cater to us older folks.  But other than the song selection there is not much else to say, except this game is a lot of fun and worthy of a 5 star rating.",2021年2月8日22:21,5,Need Music I like

2022-05-24 16:28:28.952574,It is a great game. It really is and only this game itself makes the oculus quest worth buying but for some reason it is the only game that causes problems with the quests hardware. My controller vibration becomes very weak every time I open up beat saber. Many people experienced this problem too and some of them could fix it but it seem that there are different causes. I love this game though but I get easily frustrated when something I love doesn't work.,2021年1月27日01:10,1,
2022-05-24 16:28:29.007673,"Dont get me wrong the game is very good, but has a very limited song selection and it be great if the added a custom Song options so we can make our own ""beats"" without sideloading or mods.",2021年3月19日15:27,4,This is great but
2022-05-24 16:28:29.062282,"The pcvr version is far superior because of custom songs. There needs to be a first party way to do this on quest, please it would make this the perfect rhythm game",2021年3月25日00:57,4,Fun. But we need custom songs

Then I played it.

It just feels amazing to slice cubes to the beat of your favorite bangers.

Like everyone else I wish that there was official support for custom maps, but I also understand that the devs are supposed to play licensing fees for every song they play (hence paid songpacks).

That said, modding the game is not at all difficult, and reinstalling your old maps after an update is worth the inconvenience.

I used to think this game was overhyped, but now I play it every day!",2021年2月7日23:28,5,The Hype Is Real

5. HTC Vive Pro (Arcade)
You can’t see anything, the headset is too blurry.
4. PSVR
Not too blurry. But with PlayStation move, tracking is awful. I’m pretty sure 360• levels don’t work.
3. Oculus Rift S
It’s PC based, and you can easily mod the game! The wire can get annoying though.
2. Oculus Quest
The headset strap was a bit hard to get on, but it’s great with no wires. I can easily do 360•
1. Oculus Quest 2 (Standalone/Link)
Same as Oculus Quest, but it’s 90hz and the strap is easy to get on.",2021年2月7日21:55,5,Plays best on the quest!

The expansion packs seem really expensive compared to the base cost of the game.

A few things I haven’t seen in other reviews: (1) This is wonderful physical therapy for healing a broken wrist and for keeping flexibility in your wrists. (2) You can easily get into a “flow state” with alpha and theta brain waves, which makes this a nice moving meditation tool. (3) It’s anti-aging for the brain on many levels—right-left hand variance; quick response; responding to percussive rhythms; and cardio exercise delivering oxygen to cells.",2021年2月8日03:47,5,One of the Best VR Games

I'm not the first to say this in the reviews but I really hope the developers will start to pay attention. The game would be so much better with more popular music selection or even custom song ability. Think Guitar Hero and the like.,2021年2月27日13:44,3,Great game and experience but...
2022-05-24 16:28:49.900501,Obviously if you play this game for hours on end you will need to buy an expansion pack to keep it entertaining! But those first 40 hours are really great 😊,2021年3月7日16:13,5,Worth the money

I think the ability to tweak settings to smooth out the learning curve makes a big difference. They’ve also nailed the simplicity of gameplay.

2022-05-24 16:29:21.179374,"Great for exercising and jamming out but the only issue I have is the “free songs” have not been updated in awhile and because of that most people usually pick around 3 to 10 songs to constantly pick because they’re more enjoyable than others to play, but with no new songs coming out and a good chunk of the songs you want being locked behind a paywall it makes wanting to come back every day hard when you only get new songs every 1 to 4 months and you have to pay 10-20$ for the new album that you most likely only will play 2-4 out of 8-11 of the songs, (i know type can pick individual songs but it cost more without the discount).",2021年2月23日12:32,4,A good first Oculus game.

What I’m saying is that you will need to have a good computer if you want to play songs that are not already on beat saber and since they don’t update the game and add more songs your kinda forced into paying for the other songs you may not want just for a fresh new block slicing challenge",2021年2月23日22:36,4,Fun but with some problems
2022-05-24 16:29:21.345038,"I heard reviews saying this game was like guitar hero so I was reluctant to buy it, thankfully there was a demo as this is the best game I have played in years. If you like playing racquet sports I think you will love this game. Also think this game is great for a good workout. The BTS pack is superb even made me like barriers, BTS is not particularly my kind of music but it works and the levels maps are first class, IMO avoid monster cat pack bought that one after BTS personally I think it's kind of boring the music is good though expert+ maps are really boring, Monster cat rocket league is a good fun pack though",2021年2月6日06:46,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 16:29:31.545480,"This game is amazing. It’s insane how addicting slicing blocks with lightsabers can get; it’s also insane how quickly beat saber can make your arms feel like painful spaghetti noodles. This game is extraordinarily fun, I highly suggest buying it, but you need to prepare yourself for the most sore arms you will ever have.

I should note that taking breaks is CRUCIAL in this game. I stopped taking breaks at one point because I thought I was getting really close to finishing a song, and my body punished me with extreme exhaustion and mental deterioration.

5 stars. With how fun this game is, it’s worth it to destroy your arms.",2021年2月10日00:55,5,It’s amazing and very painful
2022-05-24 16:29:31.608371,"Beat Saber compares to nothing! It’s like VR was intended for this game. For sure, Beat Saber doesn’t even use half the capabilities of VR, but without VR experiences like this weren’t possible.
When they first start with VR, a lot of people want to play games they are already familiar with from 2D gaming. But games like First Person Shooters or Adventures don’t work out nearly as good as completely new game concept native to the VR.
Beat Saber is the best example for great VR game design.

Also wish they would add some more hit songs than they have. I don't care much for the songs that comes with the basic game. So I don't really play them.
I'm excited to say that I have been working hard at getting higher scores and can finally complete a few songs on expert. I do wish there were more 360° songs. Also wish there was a way to add more walls, specifically the ones that make you move more and squat. I use Beat Saber as a cardio workout. It really does help me burn some calories and get my heart pumping.",2021年2月5日12:27,5,Love this game!
2022-05-24 16:29:31.778610,"I absolutely love this game, but there are some things I would like to discuss... 
I would love to be able to have custom songs, because there isn’t much to play unless you want to spend extra on music packs. Which don’t get me wrong, are great but that gets into a little more money. It’s only because the game is 50$ already , which is a fare price for the game quality.

2022-05-24 16:29:41.980957,"This is honestly just one of those games that you need to have on your VR headset, as it is one of those games that everyone can enjoy with or without the DLC's. Coming from a standpoint where I bought the game as a bundle with the Imagine Dragons DLC, my opinion may be different than others. This game is so much fun with friends and family as you try to beat each others scores, as well as improves a lot of you both physically and mentally. Beat Saber has heavily increased how quickly I can read things, my reaction speed, and so much more. Its a game that is challenging if you want to push yourself to the best, while also being accessible to people who want it chill and slow.

I have video proof of my sword passing through a cube (in the song rum n’ bass) and still telling me I got it wrong. The video shows in perfect view the sword passing through the cube and the game saying it was wrong. Beat saber, please fix the cubes, your game is practically unplayable.

EDIT: Now the sabers will barley even recognize that the blocks have been hit. On this one I’m not blaming the game but the headset in general. The new update plus the new lack of support in most games for the quest is just TERRIBLE.",2020年12月21日11:14,1,The new update

2022-05-24 16:30:13.614371,"This game is very good i’ve been wanting this. And i got enough money to buy it. The first day i played normal, and then the next day i modded it. (If you want to mod it look on youtube. And if you want to mod it on rift/rift s then look on youtube “Mod Assistant Tutorial” then set it to “Upload Date”) In shorter words it’s a great game.
Edit: Also there is a workout song called: “Fitbeat”.",2021年2月5日00:30,5,Best game in my opinion
2022-05-24 16:30:23.841432,"this game is the one everyone has been needing for years, however i did experience one game breaking glitch that made it a lot less fun. the glitch is that sometimes when you hit the notes correctly, your sabers will faze through them and it’ll count as a miss or an incorrect cut. this breaks the game when it does occur but most of the time it’s amazing. runs smoothly, gameplay is good and except for that one glitch it’s the perfect game",2021年2月5日05:55,5,THE PERFECT GAME! HOWEVER...
2022-05-24 16:30:23.897813,i have always loved the concept of beatsaber ever since my grandpa had a vr. I was overjoyed to receive a oculus quest 2 for Christmas which has brought me lots of fun. I have been playing beatsaber for only 3 months on my own and i am now able to pass most expert level except for ghost of course. Anyways the only complaint i would have is that the game sometime would not pickup the saber hitting the note even though i saw it go through. Great game all in all but just 1 bug that is a bit irritating. :),2021年2月19日10:05,5,u don’t need to read :)
2022-05-24 16:30:23.954366,I had a blast playing this game and my dad was able to keep up with it and liked how the blocks were 3D. I play the game and love it even tough I’m overweight and am 6’4 I still enjoy it and beat players online every day. It has lots of levels but if you wanna play songs that are newer you will have to buy them which I wish they hadn’t done.,2021年2月9日06:02,5,Fun game for all ages!
2022-05-24 16:30:24.012719,"I never thought anyone would figure out how to make a game that would be so fun to dance to at home.
When this game finds a way to incorporate feet movement it will be the absolute best.

My 7 and 8 yo sons love it! I played on the oculus quest when I got that and enjoyed it and equally enjoy it on the quest 2! You can’t go wrong just buy it! If you liked DDR even just a little you’ll love this game and feel like a saber BOSS! No regrets buying this game. But on a serious note modding is great saber any song in the world but the stock songs slap too!",2021年2月3日11:16,5,5 star because it’s great

Well those times are over if you put on your Oculus and smash all those funny blocks. You are the master of the light sabers that you wanted to become since you watched Star Wars in elementary school, that your uncle lended your dad on a ripped dvd! Man, I just can’t get enough of this game. I played it on my Rift a few years ago on the rift of a friend, the same evening I bought a Rift, checked if it worked on my PC, had a little depression and ordered a new PC. I played it a lot and then forgot about it just to realize a year later, that there is a campaign mode. I then became addicted for a few days, played every level, became bored and the rift landed in the corner again. After I sold my Rift, I was a bit sad and then the Quest 2 came out, I smashed my hard earned money in the face of Facebook and bought this. Then I bought the Quest-Version of BS and realized that it now has an addictive online mode. Jackpot 😁 I play the game every second in the lunch break in homeoffice and burn about 1000 calories a day just by having fun, which is like hookers, but way cheaper 😁.",2021年2月4日02:23,5,Best casual game that I have ever played

2022-05-24 16:31:05.862195,I really like this game but it’s sad that you have to buy songs. — Please add custom songs it’s kinda boring doing the same songs over and over again,2021年6月12日01:04,5,Cool game
2022-05-24 16:31:05.916927,"從PSVR跳到Oculus系統，首選都是beat saber, 我認為最好推薦朋友加入VR的遊戲，最華麗的效果及好聽的音樂，再加上超酷的光劍！",2021年3月2日17:02,5,VR games = Beat saber + others
2022-05-24 16:31:05.975642,"Hello Developers, I would love this game even more if you added so we can play custom songs without any wires or sidequest hard instructions from videos because people love watching custom songs made by people and I wish you could att it to quest so we don't have to have the oculus connect cable to get custom songs on quest 2 or 1 and can you also do the same so we can get our own custom sabers? Hope you do this soon because I would love it!!!",2021年2月4日09:47,5,I LOVE THIS GAME but...
2022-05-24 16:31:16.183855,"Honestly, this game should just come bundled with the Oculus from the go. Gameplay is super intuitive and fun, it really just sells the whole VR concept to anyone trying it for the first time. That said, more music packs, please. Yes, I know you can side load songs but it’s a pain, and I’d be more than willing to pay for some classic rock, a Disney song pack, or even... a Hamilton song pack?",2021年2月4日06:45,5,Must Have

2022-05-24 16:31:16.318525,Beat Saber is a great game but it is in desperate need of more music. Yes. Licensing to use a song costs money but with how huge a customer base this game has I know its feasible to get new content on there for free for its users. I will continue to play this but there is a reason why most YouTubers mod their game for more music.,2021年1月31日03:05,3,Needs more music
2022-05-24 16:31:16.383538,I really enjoy this game but I got too fastly bored because of the lack of different musics... The campaign is interesting to discover all kinds of game modes but the musics are always the same due to the poor choice of songs. I find the game too expensive for this lack of diversity.,2021年3月5日06:13,3,Good game but lack of content

2022-05-24 16:31:26.767250,This is one of those vr games you can sink hours and hours into without getting board and there is also other music packs you can purchase which make the game even better.,2021年2月28日14:11,5,One of the best vr games.

2022-05-24 16:31:26.883021,"This game is amazing. I've bought it a total of 2 times, for PSVR and now for Quest. The base game is alright, but once you find out how to mod Beat Saber, it's way more fun. With mods you can play custom songs by yourself, or in multiplayer! You can even get custom sabers, custom bloqs (or blocks), and you can even get mods that allow you to throw your sabers into space! If you choose to get this game, you'll probably never stop playing it.",2021年2月2日21:42,5,MUST READ

I was a drummer in my younger years which I think helps me out as I've put up some decent scores even on hard. I'm definitely using this to get me back in shape a loose a few pounds. Like others said I do think they should include more songs. Don't let a 50+ year old guy beat you online!",2021年2月7日00:47,5,Love it
2022-05-24 16:31:37.185461,So this is a great game but I want them to add the online custom songs and custom sabers because not everyone including does not have a pc or laptop to connect my quest 2 to so I want them to add that feature so people who dont have pcs or laptops they can do custom online songs.,2021年2月7日07:05,5,Amazing

2022-05-24 16:31:37.297361,"Beat saber is a greath game, with a great variety of difficulties so that not so good people can play it, it has a lot of rhythm and can be a good exercise in the greatest difficulties, it also comes with around 30 songs, customization of colors and others, but when the game more shines, is when you add custom songs and the mods like custom sabers.

 Some of these custom songs are simply amazing (like Mr. blue Sky) and the sabers give a whole different vibe to the game, although it may be complicated, I recommend you try to do it, just search a tutorial.

 Beat Saber by itself is a great game, but with the custom songs and the mods, you can bring out its true potential.",2021年2月2日12:25,5,A great game and you can make it better.

I will play this game until I'm sweating and my arms are hurting. The only thing that I have found disappointing about this game is the small amount of content that you get initially. There is only about 20 songs in total that you get to play and about 1/3 of them sound the same. It would also be nice to see some saber and environmental customization options (or even unlockables). All in all though it is a great game for all ages. If it was possible I would have given this game 4.5 stars...,2021年2月19日04:18,4,Super FUN! But needs more...

I bought it on the Quest2 directly, and I was hoping to install it on my pc after I got a good pc, but you need to buy it again for pc. This is a bit sad and annoying. For example Vador Immortal can be bought on the Quest2 and also installed on pc if you want to have better graphics.

However, the only point that makes me give 4/5 stars is the quantity and variety of songs. I get that the number and quality of the songs is good and that Facebook need money (apparently) but there are just not so many VERY good songs or with a decent variety. 
Just to be clear, I know that there are a lot of sites that can give you custom Beat Saber songs for like everything and for free but, unlikely, I spent a lot of money for my Oculus and I don't have enough to upgrade to a PC with a compatible graphic card so I cannot install Beat Saber on my PC.",2021年2月18日00:44,4,GREAT but..
2022-05-24 16:33:32.073025,Ok it's good but it's expensive if you want songs you kinda know if it was a lower price or just pay the 22.99 that should be enough plus developer disabled live sharing which says alot doesn't want others seeing to try and get others to buy it I think you should open it up for people to see and lower price of songs or give them free more so when we pay 22.99 for it already part from that it's good enough to pass time on,2021年2月22日10:12,4,Hmmm

2022-05-24 16:33:42.684502,Back when I didn’t own a vr headset I had seen videos of people playing beat saber and it was like a wish for me to be able to play it. Now that I’ve playing it for over two months I can safely say this is my favorite vr game. It’s so much fun to play whether I play multiplayer or single player. The songs they have on it are good and fun to play. The only problem I have with it seems to be with the motion sometimes but it’s an amazing game nonetheless. It would be kinda cool to add some sort of custom songs to be able to play lots of songs but it’s probably hard to do that on quest so I’ll be fine without. For people who are looking at the reviews of this game to see what it’s like I say to get the game.

2022-05-24 16:34:35.014597,"This game is amazing! It comes with a lot of songs to play and fiddle with if you don't want to get ""serious"" about the game (my one friend thinks all the songs sound the same, but she clearly isn't familiar with Dubstep, trap, house music). There are quests, challenges, online battles, So MUCH to explore, AS IS! 

I'm super cheap, but even I'm willing to pay for bundles/add-ons for this game. They are worth it to me. And I love watching my kids jam out while they play too. When you purchase new music it doesn't appear on the main screen with the OST albums, like I thought that would. You have to go into ""Music Packs"" and select the music album then download each song, by selecting each song, then it will download, and you have to go into ""Music Packs"" to play those songs. Which is fine, once you know where they are.  

This game can be really simple if you want to be chill and lazy. But it's also a GREAT WORKOUT! Turn on the obstacles, bump up to HARD or EXPERT, and when I tell you, ""You're gonna sweat!"" I mean YOU'RE GONNA SWEAT BUCKETS!! (Unless you one of those lucky freaks that don't sweat) Either way, you will get a leg, arms, and core workout.

A real hard game that takes time and effort with plenty of practice that makes you never want to stop. It's a good way to get your daily exercise in with a little bit of gaming too and playing it with your friends makes it better than ever. A game that takes time to get good at but is very rewarding with exercise and the sweet victory of completion as you get your new high score put up on the board for others to compete against.

The environment customisations are all very samey; any colour you like, as long as it's bkack. And the music..

Well, I guess that's what really puts me off. The range if styles is very narrow. They've really gone fir quantity over quality. I just find pretty much all the tracks irritating. (And, yes, I'm including the premium content there.) I guess I could just play with no sound, but that kind of defeats the purpose.

On my first try with no tutorial I beat country rounds on hard. On my second try I beat it on expert. I feel like the game will become repetitive quickly. I know that there is a whole modding community which may fix this for me. But I don't feel that should be necessary. Since the game is already almost 50 dollars, I don't think the base content should be beatable in such a short amount of time. I also do not like the campaign very much. I don't think random increases in difficulty are the way to go, it would be like putting spike pits on the track in a running race. I would prefer more varied songs and harder speeds but not ""move your hands 650m in this song"". The gameplay itself still gives it a great rating but definitely room for improvement",2021年2月19日20:35,4,Fantastic beginner experience.

I've bought the Linkin Park pack (oh, to be young again), and am having so much fun beating my scores!
I'm now keeping my fingers crossed for more rock themed packs. (Guns n Rose's, Aerosmith, U2, Depeche Mode, and an 80s pack would be perfect... hint hint to the developers)",2021年1月29日06:50,5,Love. This. Game!
2022-05-24 16:35:16.811020,I absolutely love this game I play it all the time. It is a great way to get moving and its replayability is amazing. This game doesn't get old. My only complaintnis that I thought when I bought it that it would come with songs I recognized (like what comes in the music packs) unfortunately it only comes with songs that are kind of techno and created for beatsaber. You can buy extra music packs of the other more recognizable songs though and these packs are frequently on sale so it works out in the end. I highly reccomend this game.,2021年1月28日21:18,5,Great game but...
2022-05-24 16:35:16.869857,"What a game, at first I can imagine it would get a bit pricey as the additional songs/packs are not cheap and soon add up.

I will say that I am in my 60s and not a gamer but neither of these points is an obstacle to enjoying Beat Saber.   It is just really great fun and a great workout - I normally play it for about an hour and the time flies by.  As you play more you gradually get better and now I can successfully tackle a few songs on Expert level which seemed impossible a month ago.

Not many of the standard songs are really to my taste but there are enough and I have topped up by purchasing a couple of add-on music packs to a give a bit of extra variety.

The only problem I would have with it is the starting songs that u get, all there is are 3 OSTs, Extras and camellia songs which are hard as hell for beginners. There are music packs that you can buy but the best ones are pricy my favourites are monstercat and rocket league. Thankfully if you have a PC you can download custom songs with relative ease.

But it's hard to enjoy fully when you know about the ""modability"" for pc version and it being superior in almost every way. That said, probably everyone should have this in their library, unless you hate music. The core game is great, but I will look to other platforms to enjoy it. Unless custom songs are killed off there as well and the community with it. 

The Quest hardware also shows off its pros and cons; being able to have portable play is just fantastic, but at the same time the tracking will let you down eventually.

I do have problems with it though. The base game has a very limited selection of songs and the DLC packs are much too expensive for what your getting out of them. This is were custom songs come in. A program called Sidequest can be used to allow for custom songs to be put of the game. It has given me endless hours of fun and is about 99% of what I've played in the game.",2021年1月26日00:22,5,One of my favorite games
2022-05-24 16:37:43.156134,"I love Beat Saber, it’s just amazing and everyone should try it, When I use Beat Saber I just feel relaxed when I listen to the music and cut blocks to the beat, there is a toll for tired arms but when they are rested up again, I assure you that you will want to play more. Any VR headset you buy, you should get Beat Saber with it, its like a pack.",2021年1月26日00:29,5,One of best music games ever
2022-05-24 16:37:43.216052,"I absolutely love this game! I have always wanted to play drums but never was allowed so my inner child kinda comes out playing this lol. I have seen u can add new music on it from somewhere else but it seems so complicated I cant figure it out ☹️ So I just play what songs r already there (& my add-on purchase ones as well) and play till I run outta time. I highly recommend it, Well worth the money!!",2021年1月26日09:21,5,LOVE
2022-05-24 16:37:43.275359,"Look, there are things I wish they would implement, but, if you want to work out and the time fly by, nothing like jumping in a multiplayer lobby and swinging away.

Please DEVs, make it so when all players are ready, the timer goes away. 60 seconds is too big a rest when trying to maintain BPM",2021年1月26日15:21,5,A must own.
2022-05-24 16:37:43.335536,"Not much of a gamer but thoroughly enjoyed this game to the extend that I bought the quest 2 headset. If you’re not used to exercise, then this is a wonderful game to get your body moving. The more you get into the game and familiar with all the options - let alone the extras that can be purchased - the greater your enjoyment of the game will become. It’s healthy and harmless good fun for one, but it’s more than that: when casting the gameplay, it’s fun for everyone in the room. Truly a magnificent game and one which I am glad I have.",2021年1月25日15:56,5,Muscles I’d forgotten I had!

Beat Saber is my favourite VR game, and I think when you want VR this should be one of the first games you should buy, look, maybe there are'nt that much songs to play, but, it's big fun still, you trying to improve in this game, and want to have fun, so trust me, Beat Saber is really good game, without custom songs aswell.. I really recomend this game, its really Amazing.",2021年1月25日21:17,5,My oppinion
2022-05-24 16:37:53.595553,"Katana’s and other custom sabers should be unlocked threw campaign and if you have already gotten to that point then you unlock the saber so we don’t have to get mods for sabers.

The solution is to delete the account from one unit and sign in and buy it on another account. I wouldn't mind that too much but ALL the games on the unit from the original account go away too with no way to play them. I have a big family and don't prefer kid sweat all over my Oculus, lol.

2022-05-24 16:38:25.184611,I first played beat saver on playstation vr and it was pretty good. I got it on my quest 2 a month ago and the difference is HUGE. I found that on the quest I got much higher framerates and better performance. Beat saber has fantastic graphics and the songs are very good too.,2021年1月29日12:28,5,Best music game ever
2022-05-24 16:38:35.376713,I love music and used to Guitar Hero and Rock Band... Beat Saber is a newer better version of those games.  I got the BTS Tiny Tan pack and I love it!

Over all though best game of all time must buy! I bought like a bunch of the extra songs because it’s so fun. Some of them I’m on expert + but mostly expert, besides the walls 0 complaints and that’s like a super small thing. Way way way way way fun way worth it.",2021年1月25日03:31,5,It’s very fun.

The only annoying thing is that the Playstation move controllers make if feel like you're holding the swords more than the quest controllers. In any case, this game gets 5 stars!",2021年2月5日19:34,5,I bought the quest so I could play this
2022-05-24 16:38:45.812244,"I have had beat saber for a while. This game has multiplayer to play with friends and family, music packs to buy as add one for the game and Different modes.

Overall this is the perfect game for people who are looking for a fun VR game.",2021年1月25日01:30,5,A must have VR game
2022-05-24 16:38:45.874153,"Beat Saber obviously has a lot of hype around it. But, unlike some other games, the hype is extremely deserved. I don’t think I can name a single bad thing about this game. It gives exercise, has a great concept, good graphics, and overall an excellent experience.

It’s a fun game to play with friends and get good at, and once you are good and you start grinding X+ levels, it’s also a fun workout.

I do wish there were a few more song but it isn’t that big of a deal. I love how challenging this game can be. I do however have one (maybe two)request. I wish you could creat a server, invite you friends, and then make it a public server. I also wish I could play with my friends on quick play . Just a few suggestions. Overall this game is the best. I am literally obsessed. Definitely recommend.",2021年1月29日10:32,5,DEFINITELY RECOMMEND

2022-05-24 16:38:56.374220,"Beat saber is an absolute masterpiece of a game which should be one of the first games all Quest 2 owners purchase. A great game for new players and veterans alike, albeit with a relatively limited selection of songs. The base game only comes with a few songs (I'd say roughly 30) and the only way to get more is to pay for music packs or to modify the game which not everyone is comfortable doing. A great game, but could be improved by some more levels or more genres of music packs.",2021年1月25日10:06,5,"Great game, but small selection of songs"

Now I play about an hour a day. You are (virtually) literally dancing with light sabers, knocking blocks out of your way to great music beats in lots of different ways and difficulties. It’s exhilarating. Also, bonus: I’ve surpassed my step goal for 25 days in a row playing this game daily.",2021年1月25日10:08,5,DO IT

2022-05-24 16:39:06.769011,"Tldr: good game but lack of custom songs means it get repetitive quickly. Get synth raiders instead.


Ok I actually I’ve beat saber, but..... the level get boring quickly the add on packs are expensive and not very good, and you cannot add custom songs.

2022-05-24 16:39:27.789671,This game is very good but it is only not boring when you have more than the OST songs so I would get some other music packs with it.

2022-05-24 16:39:38.206725,"This game is completely bonkers. In the first few days I played 35+ hours. The base game content is okay, but custom songs provide unlimited fun. The intial setup of custom songs is a bit tricky but is actually just following like 10 steps. After getting custom songs you can go into further modding like mapping extensions or noodle maps. Also PinkUtils is a must for a PC-like experience. Go check it out now! Why are you still reading, just buy it already!",2021年1月23日21:56,5,This game is insane and perfect
2022-05-24 16:39:38.266012,"This game is why I got my quest 2. The only problem with it is that it needs more songs, but this isn't possible due to licensing and stuff like that.

It is also a wonderful game to get a workout in and stay active (especially during quarantine). However, the song choices are extremely limited and buying song packs is kind of ridiculous when you’ve already bought the full game. Though it’s a tedious and confusing process, I have installed many custom songs onto my game and absolutely love it! Beat Saber’s developers should definitely make adding custom songs an easier (and game-supported) process.",2021年1月24日06:33,5,Very fun with custom songs

I have one thing I would like to ask to add now I know you have already gotten plenty of requests for this but here we go Custom Songs it would bring so much more excitement to the game and I can understand why it may not be added yet it takes time for you to be able to see what songs are allowed and not allowed just like stealing a song so would very much like that but otherwise game is awesome.,2021年2月5日13:10,5,This Game Is Awesome DEVS PLEASE READ

I think it would be great to see some upgrades however. Id recommend the developers improve the amount of sound tracks. For example, it would be great to see a radio station or mix up genres while you play with other people. Otherwise great game!",2021年1月24日09:25,5,Great for beginners!

If there was anything negative at all, would be the lack of music packs. I would love an AC/DC, Pink Floyd etc. Still, the Imagine Dragons is an amazing pack and worth the purchase. If you are looking for a must have first game this is it!",2021年1月24日05:24,5,Get ready for fun

There will be times when a bug comes up when im playing but they aren’t really anything big to me. But one of them that i notice the most is when my saber phases through a block and it not counting, or it would count it as a wrong swing which it clearly wasn’t.

Overall the music is good, although it would be nice to see a bit more variety in the ""included"" packs. Pop Stars is definitely one of my favorite tracks, especially since it has vocals, unlike many of the other included ones.

2022-05-24 16:39:59.104574,I have bought this game twice firstly on PSVR but now on Quest 2.  If you haven’t played before I would recommend playing the campaign first as this introduces you to the different skills needed for variants in the solo game.   Although there are easy levels flexibility and stamina are needed for the harder levels.   You can have hours of fun dancing round and slicing through the blocks and if you are competitive and what those high scores it’s quite addictive.  If you enjoy rhythm games then you’ll love this game but if your serious gamer expect sweat and tears.,2021年1月24日04:12,5,I love this game
2022-05-24 16:39:59.164464,This game is very fun and great for showing people who are new to vr. Even after going through a lot of work to get custom songs because the normal songs suck it can still get very boring after a decent bit of play. Good game though a do recommend if you are new.,2021年2月17日11:54,4,Really fun but...

2022-05-24 16:40:30.491343,I bought my oculus quest 2 last Tuesday and beetsaber was one of the first games I downloaded. I have nor been able to put it down except when I need to take a break or let the headset charge. It can definitely use more songs but ultimately the oculus quest doesn't have the greatest ammount of memory. its processing power can make it difficult to play harder levels while keeping track of hand movements but setting options such as static lights can help make for more processing dedicated to your playing rather than aesthetics. Wish I could play against my ghost thought.,2021年1月26日17:48,5,New favorite game!
2022-05-24 16:40:30.554211,"So for all the people who are saying there are no good songs you can buy a USB A to USB C cable for like $15 and then you can have Sidequest, for tracking I don't know But I haven't had any issues.

My only complaint is that the only way to get custom songs is to side load them (which is pretty dang hard). I wish that in the future they add a creator mode where you can create your own songs and beat maps! Overall 5 stars",2021年1月23日10:50,5,It is  G R E A T

2022-05-24 16:40:40.892071,I don’t think it’s possible to have bought a Quest without knowing about Beat Sabre in advance. It deserves every 5 star review to be honest. Hours of fun and highly addictive.,2021年2月16日00:22,5,Worth every star
2022-05-24 16:40:40.964874,"When I just got done setting up the Oculus Quest 2, I don't know what type of VR games to play. There were so many reviews and YouTube and many games had more cons than pros, but the ones that others enjoyed just wasn't my cup of tea. Then I happened to stumble upon Beat Saber. I was lost for words. Seeing a basic block game was surprisingly put so well together and I had a liking for the game so quickly. With sound tracks that are really catchy to songs that everyone know and love. It was a really fun game to play and I haven't put down the headset since. Beat Games has reached its peak in 2020 due to COVID-19. Even though we are still living with a tragic virus, we still can have fun with boxes on our faces slashing virtual blocks. Now that Beat Saber introduced multiplayer, I spent a whole 4 hours playing non-stop even if I had so much fatigue that I could barely move my arms. I really recommend this game. It has the best experience for newcomers of VR. I hope that everyone gets a piece of enjoyment that I had and still have to this day. I can't thank the Devs enough for this wonderful game that we call Beat Saber.",2021年1月22日14:11,5,A Real Start to Virtual Reality.

Must buy for the quest 2!",2021年1月22日14:54,5,Talk about making exercising fun!
2022-05-24 16:40:51.287601,This game never seemed fun to me when watching videos but playing it is some of the most fun I’ve had. The soundtrack is one of the best and it is very fun to slice blocks as the formations change a lot every level and difficulty. The campaign has really cool challenges and there are some fun modifiers to mess around with. In practice mode you can change the speed of the song which can make for some extra fun gameplay. Overall it seems very surface level but the amount of little things you can do for each individual song is awesome.,2021年1月31日18:46,5,One of the Best VR games

Tone down the difficulty, please? | On To 2: the multiplayer. If I miss a single note I am immediately in 4th. Like excuse me wtf? Its a single note why do I get punished so hard. Also if you dont tone down camellia difficulty atleast make a setting for multiplayer that is “everything except camellia” or something like that.

I finally got the Oculus Quest 2 last Christmas and this was the first app I purchased. Didn’t need the demo.

2022-05-24 16:40:51.470097,This is a great game that I have been playing for a while but there isn’t that many songs that come with the game. I would seriously recommend getting custom songs because it’s a lot more fun to play. There is extra songs that you can buy in the normal game but I don’t recommend getting them since they are expensive and you can probably just find them in the custom songs list anyway. I’m giving it 5 stars because it’s a really fun game and custom songs makes it much better.,2021年1月23日09:32,5,Get custom songs
2022-05-24 16:41:01.674041,"The complaint I have about this game is my score. If I could just stop dancing I'd score better. The game is fun and, if one dances through the songs, there's more exercise to be had. I guess it's a trade off. I am actually losing weight, 10 pounds in two and a half months. Even my husband likes it and he doesn't like dancing. Great focus game. I guess I'll have to spend more on new music packs. Maybe Oculus can discount them?",2021年1月23日01:08,5,Wish I could score higher

Another thing is that when I saw Star Wars as a kid I thought I’d never experience what it would feel like to weild a light saber. Beatsaber has haptics that satisfy that long held desire!

I love this and recommend it to people who have a strong hatred on boxes with arrows and whoever is energetic enough to beat something that is six minutes long. But the new latest update kind of broke something. 

So I’m playing a round of multiplayer ( servers just opened up for me ) and I lost. But , I could still play. I thought they did this so you could join in on the fun until I turned around. It was still going through and by the time it was finished I was still on the leaderboard. I unlocked immortality pretty much. I tried this out a couple of times and it happened again and again and again. Probably worth fixing as it could act as a cheap way to win a game. I’m not sure if other players saw that it happened, but yeah I’d say worth a look at. 

Over all, such a good game and I love it! Looking forward to more future updates ( if they every happen, which they might..probably ).

2022-05-24 16:42:15.147779,"Beat saber is just over glorified. Never pay $30 for this game. synth riders has more songs, better mechanics, developers that are invested in the community, BUILT IN CUSTOM SONG SUPPORT, better online mode, mics in the multiplayer lobby, and doesn’t try to charge you for an overpriced game as well as $3 per INDIVIDUAL dlc song that should already be included. This game would maybe be worth $20 before they destroyed custom song support, but not any more. Just buy synth riders, you won’t regret it",2021年1月26日14:29,2,Buy Synth Riders not Beat saber
2022-05-24 16:42:15.207369,"I bought it as my first VR experience, and indeed it is a good entry game. You can spend hours playing it if... you can stand the soundtrack included.  The music is simply awful and makes the experience not enjoyable at all. Also the extra packs you can buy are targeted to a very young audience. But, the vr scene is increasingly populated by users who were born before year 2000, who do not like the music in the app. I wonder why nobody seem to care for these new users. I would give a higher score if it were not for the awful music included",2021年2月15日01:18,2,"Hypnotic, but awful music"

This game is amazing and keeps you immersed in the game for hours even if you are not the most into the exercise section it is also really good to let friends experiment and enjoy the world of virtual reality.

The only thing missing is official moding support for changing the lightsabers and adding more songs from the community.

2022-05-24 16:44:10.256375,"Ok so I finally figured out to switch off fail so putting an extra star. Two stars docked for not giving a few more instructions for newbies and the lack of feedback to customers. Guys, when you have been working all day, you don't  want to have to go through the overwhelming control panel. A few simple tutorial screens would be nice. Some don't bother with instructions but maybe they have more time to play with.

I wanted to review a couple of music packs I bought. The Timbaland music pack is absolutely fantastic if you are looking for moves that make you feel like you're dancing with the music. It doesn't try and trick you, it just makes you move with the music in a fun and dare I say it, musical way. The choreography is good and works well with Beat Saber. I fully recommend it and congrats to the devs who synced the music with the game.

Imagine Dragons, on the other hand, was disappointing. Here you aren't dancing, you are beating, beating a drum, and it is pretty mechanical and, for me at least, pretty boring at times. I lose concentration and miss. The levels are pretty badly designed too. I can barely hit an S in hard in most of the titles and Extra is impossible. In other packs, I hit S consistently and can cope with Extra hard.  It is not all bad. There are some nice moments. But if you are looking to buy a pack and not sure which one or ones, then avoid Imagine Dragons unless you dig beating a drum, and go for Timbaland for a more musical and dance experience.  Yet to try the other packs.",2021年1月28日07:36,3,"Yes, you can turn off fail and enjoy!"
2022-05-24 16:44:10.319984,I enjoy this the most of the games tried so far. I can only play sitting down but this hasn’t affected my enjoyment.

2022-05-24 16:44:20.522291,It's a bit frustrating getting used to the moves and the speed but it feels great when you can finally get through a particularly hard level. The music is a little young and 'club' type for me but it's a great tempo for the game.,2021年2月1日14:36,5,Love this game!

Can mod for custom songs
Can be a decent work out

Cons:
Cant play multiplayer if you have modded the game
Stupid price for the add on songs when there is 2 good ones at max
Most modded songs are terribly made.

BUT most importantly, once you start getting onto the higher levels like expert the hand tracking will constantly mess up, i think due to how fast you have to move your hands, causing you to constantly mess up and go insane because you know you hit it but it wont register.

To sum it all up this is the first game that makes me want to die a slow painful death but if you can look past that minor detail then its a great game.",2021年2月5日05:02,4,READ BEFORE PURCHACE.

Yes, I can beat it. I promise. I've done darkeater midir over and over solo. 
This though, this is tedium, not difficulty. I had a lot of fun earlier in the game. It's not worth finishing though. I don't want to memorize the game's 7th recycling of a song so that I can spit out the random notes that don't fit the over-used song's rhythm with a sudden-death playstyle. I can't.

Avoid Audica unless you are a super diehard rhythm fan; no developer support, community is lackluster, and overly complicated gameplay), this ranks number 3. Only because the developer support is spotty (new song pack regularly, but there are a number of features promised over a year ago that have not materialized) and there is no native custom song support. They should also increase the graphical fidelity on the Quest 2 to more closely match the PC counterpart. 

And frankly, I'm nitpicking. Beat Saber is otherwise a very, very good Rhythm game and, to a lesser extent, exercise game. Easily in the top 25 on the Quest!",2021年1月17日05:41,5,Top 3 Rhythm Game on the Quest!

Pros:
All the songs are bops. They all just hit unlike other rythm games 
The online mode is really fun. There's barely anything bad to say about online 
Simple and straight to the point. There's no complex instructions. Just pick it up and go
Tutorial is optional. Thank god

Cons:
The only con is the campaign. Sometimes the challenges can be a bit tedious, but that's more of a nitpick than con

But I suppose that’s anything.... The part that gets me is the price tag. $40 for music you don’t recognize and the ability to spend another $50 on songs you do. I honestly only like 5 or so songs they have. Needs more classic rock and songs from rock band/guitar hero. As it is (in my opinion) the game should be $20. 

To be fair, my nephew plays it everyday for at least an hour. So maybe it’s just cuz I’m old that I think the music sucks lol.",2021年1月22日11:00,3,Fun at first

Why the one star? We both have the Oculus Quest 2 but we are not able to play against one another using the same account. That in its own is an absolute disaster. I would gladly give the game 5 stars if they would make that change. So for us to play together, it seem I have to make a FB account for my son and buy  the game again.

With great motion tracking, some good tunes, and a good challenge, this game is nearly a perfect package. I only dock this one a star due to a lack of modes and music (however this is subjective because there is a campaign mode, solo mode, online mode and leaderboards).

Now if we could just get custom maps onto the Quest 2 somehow, this game would be PERFECT!

A guide so far on available music packs that I’ve played:

Monstercat Pack: highly recommend this pack. Basically a better version of all the original OST’s.

Rocket League: buy it if you have Rocket League or if you are looking for an intermediate challenge on Expert+. Glide is a good song for beginning Expert+ players.

Green Day: don’t buy it unless you’re a Green Day fan. Honestly, even then it’s pretty disappointing. Holiday was really the only song I had fun on, everything else feels tediously slow.

Timbaland: only buy if you’re learning Expert+ or a Timbaland fan. I beat every level except the last one on the first try, and I only lost because I hit my desk.

Linkin Park and Imagine Dragons: Highly recommend these packs, especially if you’re looking for songs that aren’t dubstep but still fun to play (unlike Green Day). The maps feel fresh, and they give a really good challenge.",2021年1月15日12:16,5,An Absolute Must + Add-On Guide

When I bought this game I would go on the hardest levels just to see how insane it is and I would think it’s impossible to do that. But you can clearly see yourself progressing at the game because those levels are way more doable now.

The one flaw with this game is that there’s limited content and unless your a fan of the artist of the music packs, there not very good.

The game makes me mad - I don't care if *I* suck and miss but I hate when I know I have done an FC and still have a bunch of misses.
The music choice is limited and poor. I bought the Imagine Dragons pack but what is badly needed is the ability of users to add their own songs/maps... without that, the lifespan of the game is low.

2022-05-24 16:47:07.977273,Honestly this is a very fun game to play but when someone request to play a song that needs to be bought from the packs it is a little annoying. So I hope they fix this problem in the future other than that this game is amazing,2021年1月28日11:27,5,Great game
2022-05-24 16:47:08.039125,"I first started playing this game a year ago on The psvr, recently got quest 2 and its so fun!!! The multiplayer is very fun and The game feels so much smoother!!",2021年5月21日03:14,5,AMAZING!
2022-05-24 16:47:08.102803,"Yes could there be bigger song library. There are ways around that but....

The biggest thing to me is the online make your own group should have a microphone on/off. I would love to have the choice to talk to whom ever I’m playing. At least as a option for both players. 

Some people won’t but if both mic’s are on let them interact. 

Other than that 10/10",2021年1月31日16:30,4,Almost flawless

2022-05-24 16:47:28.998060,"So this is basically the best vr game ever made. I got BMBF so I could use my favorite songs, but that is optional. Slicing blocks as they fly towards you to the beat of music? It sounds scary from the outside, but on the inside, you can see how almost everyone is addicted to beat saber.",2021年1月20日00:49,5,Worth every penny

Aside from that it’s a great music and rhythm game!",2021年2月8日20:15,4,Great! But...
2022-05-24 16:47:39.445566,"I don't think there's any game I've played more than Beat Saber, even counting non-vr games on PC. Plus with BMBF you can have custom songs, sabers, walls, lights, auto download new trending songs every day etc it's just endless fun and never gets old!",2021年1月22日19:18,5,Best game ever

2022-05-24 16:47:49.893460,"It’s a really good game, but I’m even gonna waste anyone’s time. 
If you have a Rift S or Rift, or even are using Quest link to play Beat Saber, don’t get it from the Quest or Oculus store. I know the only people with it are on Quest, but if you manage to see this and have a Link cable or substitute, and your PC works with it, buy it on steam. It’s so much easier to download custom sabers, songs, notes, etc.

Good game, just not that replayable. Still pretty good without BMBF.",2021年1月30日23:15,4,Great game
2022-05-24 16:47:49.956318,"Love this game, gets you moving and is a lot of fun. Would have been a 5* review but I feel it is let down by the multiplayer section. It's a bit of a hassle when you have to send your other oculus friends a server code to join your party. There is no voice chat available online which is a disappointment for me.  It really takes the fun out of multiplayer not being able to chat in the lobby. Hope beat saber will update and enable this in the future. 

Otherwise, its pretty cool 😎",2021年1月30日20:53,4,Great game but

2022-05-24 16:48:00.364943,When the multiplayer update came out I didn’t know how they were going to do it. But it is definitely worth it. They did the setup perfectly and made beatsaber even more fun. Only problem with multiplayer is unless you both have the music pack or song you can’t do it. And I’m sure they will add in a talking feature also.,2020年10月14日21:24,5,They did the update the right way
2022-05-24 16:48:00.425225,"The game is fun. I'll be honest, it's the reason I bought the Oculus Qest 2. 

But the song catalog is really dull and very limited. I'm amazed there isn't more downloadable content. I actually play Supernatural a lot more just because of the wider variety of songs.",2021年2月8日12:10,3,Meh song selections
2022-05-24 16:48:00.487190,Honestly thank god for Christmas and my birthday otherwise I’d never have this game.

 Also to the developers:  can’t you put filters in the competition games like there is in Pokerstars.? Ex:  I only want to play to the Imagine Dragons songs, not the  electronic ones (hate these).  This should be easy to do.",2021年1月29日22:31,4,Love; however
2022-05-24 16:48:31.819855,"I've had the game for almost 2 months now and must say it's one of the ""must own"" titles for any VR owner. It has a fun and engaging soundtrack with different modes and challenges to accomplice to really stretch the life of the game. But at some point you are going to want more and unfortunately like all things it will cost you. And even then the selection is limited. And the handling of custom songs is a grey area and also can be troublesome to impliment on the quest. At least some sort of system for user generated songs though their own track builder. But for again that's for people who feel they want more variety. But for casual players it should tie you over until your next new game purchase easily",2021年1月30日07:18,4,"Great game, read before buying"

Can you please 1UP these difficulties. Or maybe make the levels easier.",2021年2月12日05:49,4,Camellia Levels 🥵🥵🥵
2022-05-24 16:48:42.223846,"The rhythm of your sword swings is detached from the music itself, which makes achieving any sort of immersion nearly impossible, the levels aren’t pick-up-and-play; instead there is a Geometry Dash level of practice grinding, which makes the whole experience infuriating, unless one is playing on a difficulty too easy to pose a challenge.
For God’s sake, I’m a guitarist of 13 years who’s been trained in the Japanese art of Bushido. This game should be nothing but a real blast for me, but it’s a just-plain-painful experience that I can’t even force myself to enjoy.

I dropped $29.99 on Christmas for this because my sister wouldn’t stop talking about it, and she and I both agreed to delete it within the first hour of play. I am immeasurably disappointed and disgruntled at this development, and you scummy Facebook slaves will get no more of my hard-earned money.",2020年12月26日04:50,1,Disappointing By All Accounts. Terrible.
2022-05-24 16:48:42.283874,"I absolutely love this game, I've been playing for a year and I can't get enough of it, and the addition to multiplayer a few months back made it so much better, I do only have one tiny suggestion to the multiplayer, and that's when you are searching for a lobby. Currently there are only 2 ""music type"" options, ""built in"" and ""all"", I play on ""all"" only because I like to play the dlc songs as well, but I've noticed that a lot of people who play that type as well don't have all if any of the dlc's at all, which makes it hard to play those songs or get more than 2 or 3 people with a specific song, I have two ideas to fix this, either make it to where you must own all dlc packs to play the ""all"" category, or make a new category that requires you to do this and leave the other 2 categories as they are, I feel like this will help make the online mode in beat saber much more fun and enjoyable, as those with all the dlc songs can finally play those songs all the time, and those with no dlc songs or only 1 or 2 packs can be able to play without being skipped out because everyone voted a song they didn't have.",2021年1月11日15:14,5,Suggestion to multiplayer

2022-05-24 16:50:16.420244,"This is the first game I bought and installed to my oculus after I played it on my friends ps vr, (not a fan of Playstation I actually really hate it), and I enjoyed it but since it didn't run well on a Playstation I wasn't really sure if I wanted it, so I decided to buy it anyway and it was definitely the right decision. So I made it to expert plus and the problem is that there aren't really enough enjoyable levels, I have bought alot of music packs and I wish there were more good songs, now the devs have decided to try to get to the people who listen to Bts and Timbaland to play the game and they could have replaced those packs with better music,(not a fan of either packs and the style of the music), just stick to monstercat and maybe get some good old fashioned Guns N Roses and Ozzy Osborn.

2022-05-24 16:50:26.894283,"Well, Beatsaber is a game that certainly doesn't need much more description, so I'll go straight to the Quest version. While both the PC and PSVR versions are already wonderful games for me, the Quest version clearly falls short:

It lacks a lot of graphical liveliness: There are no reflections, no billowing walls. That's a great pity, because that should be very possible with the Quest 2. We are still playing the Quest 1 version, so to speak.

What I also sorely miss is the haptic feedback: due to the missing rumble, VERY much immersion is lost. It's a pity that so little work has been done on the Quest 2 version.",2021年1月29日23:39,3,"Good game, medium port"
2022-05-24 16:50:26.959130,"The basic game is fun but without add-ons it would be nothing. The OSTs are pretty bad. The Devs make awful maps. So a you need the community mods which are unofficial (I don't think they're frowned upon otherwise the Devs would have done something by now and the entire success of this game hinges on them).  The problem is the community appears to be 99% anime freaks (weebs) so if you're a ""normal"" you could end up with a lot of headaches searching for songs that aren't trying to sound like the singers are little Japanese girls screaming for daddy. Sometimes it seems like one big awful 80s computer game song... But there are good tracks and maps out there in between and plenty of less annoying more mainstream Asian music mixed in. Once you find them and get a good playlist at expert+ level this is a fantastic workout game. Probably the most fun calorie for calorie. It takes some work and computer knowledge to make it fun though. I suggest looking at guides on how to mod this game for quest before buying otherwise you're buying a lemon. Most of the official DLC is badly mapped too once you get past expert level. Also be warned: WARM UP. This game is addictive and physical and people can seriously injure themselves if they're not careful (rotator cuff injuries the worst of them). Treat it seriously in terms of injury prevention once you get good. The same as you would any sport especially if you're a little older.",2021年1月30日06:31,3,You will sweat. You will learn Japanese.

VR is the ultimate way to play rythm games and this one is so simple and intuitive that just about anyone can play and get into it. Everyone that I have had try this game has enjoyed it, including my parents who are in their 60's and never play any video games. The songs are fun and catchy and they'll be adding more in 2021. This game would be an easy 5 out of 5 but for many, there aren't enough songs for long-term play and there isn't any official support for custom songs. Hopefully we will see some sort of legal compromise in the future so that we can have access to the large custom song community that exists for this game.",2021年1月26日19:11,4,Even non-gamers like this one!
2022-05-24 16:50:47.985184,"Let me start by saying that if you own a Quest or Quest 2 and somehow don't own this, stop hesitating and buy it... after you read the rest of my review. I've played beat saber since 2018 when the first music pack came out, and I was really curious how this game preforms on the Quest 2. At first, I thought that the graphics were very unimpressive with the original color scheme and environment. I did find a few things that MASSIVELY improved the graphical fidelity. (Tips soon) The game is very smooth on Quest 2, as well as having all the same songs and updates on PC. The multi-player is hit or miss, having a slight delay occasionally.For the colors, use a Hot pink for the left saber, and a bright greenish turquoise for the right saber, and the same pink and green for backround colors, as well as making the walls the same green. If you also override the default environment to the Linkin Park Environment, since it is newer it has better lighting and effects from the other environments from what I can tell. However, after seeing this game and seeing how AMAZING this game looks on PC by hooking up my quest, its not the prettiest looking game on the quest, but its understandable for the hardware its running on. Overall, definatly great, would give 4.5 stars if I could, but I would reccomend buying songs that you like because the built in songs do get tiresome after awhile.",2021年1月27日08:45,4,Heres a few tips for everybody.
2022-05-24 16:50:48.050702,"But need more music choices! The add on albums are expensive and there’s only a handful of them anyway.

The game is great and has been a lifeline during lockdown! I convinced my cousin to buy an oculus so pretty much every night for the last 3 months since she got it, we’ve logged on and played beat saber together - exercise and socialise 😀

It’s a little expensive, but definitely worth it!

Definitely room for some development work on the music options and “full body” exercise (one that gets you moving and squating)",2021年1月27日08:31,4,So close to being 5 star...
2022-05-24 16:50:58.256301,"I actually really enjoy playing this! It's a great cardio workout, without feeling like you're working out...which is great!! The only negative I have is there are not enough song choices. Even the songs you can purchase are extremely limited. I had to purchase some because it not as enjoyable to play to a weird techno song you have never heard before. But again, there aren't even many options to purchase. I would love it even more and probably not get bored with it after a while if there were more song options. Playing to the same songs over and over I feel is going to get a bit mundane.",2021年1月26日23:15,4,Love it but....

Honestly it's a game so good that it makes oculus  worth buying. One major gripe though. Add more songs! Like why not.

Why 3 stars?
This can't detect hight, you constantly have to turn auto adjust on and off, move your height in the setting and then it's still not totally correct, this doesn't always happen but there will be games you're swatting at the ground or the ceiling.
Second con which is huge!!!
ADD ONS ARE BARELY CHEAPER THEN THE GAME ITSELF. For the original game you get like 3 or 4 pages to flip through songs, some are lengthier then others, plus campaign, multuplayer online, party mode, and then to add about 7 more songs, most of them not good, 15.99
To me this seems crazy, now when you talk about bands like LP. Yes obviously I'm going to spend that, but you're not getting that class of music with every add on.

TL;DR
game is amazing, download it immediately!
Just watch yourself with the add ons, don't buy them until you know what you're getting. Also buy LP add on, that's a must 

After some updates could easily be a 4.5 star game",2021年1月28日12:24,3,Lots of pros with few big cons

Only one thing I would want to see - graphics update to PC level of details and effects. Everything else is perfect. Thanks to devs!!!",2021年1月31日07:46,5,I’m in love with Beat Saber
2022-05-24 16:52:11.855636,I love this game the only thing that o don’t enjoy about it is there is no cross play in the multiplayer and how expensive the music packs are but it’s still an awesome game even with my complaints also I would love to have mics on multiplayer,2021年1月18日03:25,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 16:52:22.075790,After trying Beatsaber on my brother's VR-headset in the holidays I went on and bought me my own Oculus Quest. I felt like I just couldn't live on without rythmically smashing boxes with lightsabers anymore.,2021年1月27日20:22,5,Must Have
2022-05-24 16:52:22.138639,"New updates and multiplayer, so yeah it’s getting better but not holding out too much hope for cross play with friends who bought it for their pc years ago although they are looking into it. Can’t talk to people in multiplayer, which is good and bad.. No squeakers! But sometimes you want to congrats someone and the only option is arm movements since you can’t see your hands in the lobby. Currently 72 payable add ons to add music onto your headset, sure you can sideload songs to it, but there’s risk of getting in trouble for it and even if you bought the music, beat saber and Facebook scares you away from trying it so I’ve never tried it.. 

So yeah, 4/5 due to no dialogue between players and all the expensive add ons that don’t seem to be worth it in the end.",2021年1月25日04:15,4,It’s getting better
2022-05-24 16:52:22.200662,"This game is almost perfect. It has perfect difficulty, gameplay, music, and much more. There are plenty beatmaps to play on without BMBF or DLCs, the latter i am too poor to get and the former i am too worried of my account getting banned to download. If you think you are as good as can be by beating songs on expert+, you can try one saber or no arrows. My only problem that is preventing the game from getting 5 stars is the graphics. Everything looks worse on the quest 2 version compared to pc, and even the demo on the quest looks way better so its not an issue with hardware. Don't believe me? Download the demo and see how much better it looks. The walls, sabers, saber handles, animations, and much more just look objectively worse on the full version. I can partially understand the walls since they wanted them to be transparent, but that doesn't excuse everything else. If Beat Games fixes this, I will change my 4 star to a 5 star. Thanks for reading.",2021年1月25日00:58,4,Great game but one issue

And I have paid out to purchase the songs I can, but again, there is not many. And you don’t get the option for 90 or 360 degrees on all of the songs only certain ones, which is disappointing.

I am going out of my way to buy the newer Oculus Quest 2 just to see this amazing game in Ultra HD. I'm still not tired of any of the songs. One thing i do wish, is that they added microphone capabilities to talk to other players in multiplayer mode. For those who don't want that, do Solo or Party. It is fun for all ages and my brothers beg to play on the Quest on a common basis now. 14/10 from me, OUTSTANDING JOB!",2021年1月7日07:05,5,Literally the best VR game ever

2022-05-24 16:52:43.143930,This game is really fun but I would wish for them to add something I think a lot of people would like.  Which would be to create a beat mode where you could play a beat that you could make and then you could place the blocks wherever you want.

2022-05-24 16:52:43.267482,"The game itself is very much enjoyable, however updates are few and far between, with very little in terms of content improvements.

 The use of severs hosted by steam / oculus means there's no crossplay available between the 2 platforms, not a deal breaker but certainly inconvenient if you want to play with friends. 

The worst part comes when they expect you to pay twice for the game in order to have it on the quest 2 and on the desktop (given the desktop is the only one currently with custom songs, this is really inconvenient). They'll give their usual excuse that it's because they've had to build the game for the quest. 
 Which since the game uses unity, which specifically allows them to compile, with little updates, to the quest is a feeble excuse at best. Minus the whole development time based around assets as they're already available. They really should offer at least discount for people who have it already on one platform.",2021年1月26日21:56,3,"Good game, but greedy Devs."
2022-05-24 16:52:43.332298,"I've played Beat Saber at least twice a day since I got my OC2. It lets you get into wonderful flow states just moving to the music. I'm on expert difficulty currently and having tracking problems but it could be some level of finesse I haven't acquired yet. The only real complaint I have with this game is the selection of free songs. You don't get a really large selection at all. And there's the whole Camilla pack that to me just sucks... not into it at all. So that's like 1/4 of the paid game that I lose out on because it all has the same feel and it's bad. 
Please add more free packs to this game or make custom songs a norm. You're clearly not keeping up with the needs of daily players, even with your purchaseable packs.",2021年1月26日15:49,3,Love it but..
2022-05-24 16:52:53.529123,"The game itself is great, where it falls behind is more of its performance on the quest/quest2 platform. Mostly with controller vibration issues, controllers will start to buzz very lightly or even stop (though this is usually fixed with a restart) and it only seems to happen in this game. The level of vibration makes a bigger difference than you know, until it's almost gone. Other than that not too many problems. 

Over all I would still say its an essential quest game, fit for anyone's game library.

Update: having constant problems with controller vibration, and it's only on this game. Happens nearly every time I play and isn't always fixed by restarting",2021年1月27日01:54,3,3.5 / 5

We all wish there was more of a variety!  Also, would be nice if people could play whatever song the host of the party picks!!!  It really blows having to quit songs because it doesn't inform us that so and so, doesn't have the music pack or song selected!

What I reccomend is that let’s say that you are stuck on a hard difficulty level (I would highly reccomend that you would spend some time playing campaign to get the grips) try that exact same level on expert/expert + for 10-15 mins once you have try completing the level you were stuck on you may find this a lot easier.

It really feels like it was developed by guys and mainly marketed to guys—which maybe it was, and that’s OK. All of the environments in this game have the same feel—they’re dark and some have obvious “guy” aspects. I’d just like a little more variety to satisfy a broader audience. My 17 year old daughter says the same thing. She’ll opt for other beat games that have a more variety of environments and a lighter feel. Personally, I like how Beat Saber works, but often I go to Supernatural for lighter environments. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want pink and purple fluffy backgrounds with kittens and rainbows.

I got my oculus this Christmas and did the first steps and finally purchased it and when I opened the app up, I was amazed by how amazing the graphics were. I did the tutorial that explained how to play the game and helped me to understand the controls then I moved on to some songs and then attempted  easy level on a few. I practiced and moved onto normal mode then decided to check out the other lists of songs I was able to pick from. My favourites are pop stars which is good for practicing and crab rave. Again this app is amazing and I hope this review helped a few when buying the game!",2021年1月4日10:32,5,AMAZING!!!!

2022-05-24 16:55:09.759470,Over a month now I have had the game and I love it. I have played it nonstop and really but a really big con is everyonce in a while I will somehow miss or hit the cube wrong. With that I have try multiple times to see why and after some time I knew it wasn't me missing or hitting it wrong it was the game because when I would hit a note I would miss because my Saber went through it or I would get bad cut because it went through the not then hit it the wrong way pulling back. I have try to work around it but it doesn't work at one point I even tested to see if I could get my Saber to go through the note but even after using the handle to hit it somehow I still got points and a hit for hitting it so if in the future they fix this I would be very happy. Sorry for it being so long,2021年1月23日13:05,3,Good game but needs improvements

Started my morning off playing it and was super happy with my progress on being able to get on harder levels. But now the lag is so bad I miss half the blocks and I KNOW I hit them. Then the points are glitchy they keep going up and down. Sometimes the song won’t play. But the most annoying part is knowing I hit the blocks and it says missed.

When we buy an extention its almost 15$ for 5-6 songs... so you double and triple your price !

2022-05-24 16:55:51.589415,"After nearly a year of playing Beat Saber I can tell you this is the best game on the Oculus. The new songs and maps over the last year have been incredible. Each music pack felt better and more difficult with each release. 

As a player, I didn’t realize this was a weight loss option until I weighed myself and had lost 20 pounds. A few months later I had lost 40 total. It doesn’t feel like a workout when you’re playing. Multiplayer is by far the best workout with 60 seconds in between matches. The only suggestion I would make is to be able to send a friend request to some players in the game without having to leave the game and search in Oculus.

The only issue I have is the leaderboards in Oculus not working anymore (which isn’t a Beat Saber issue, it’s an ongoing Oculus problem). I loved being able to see my progress and increase my ranking which made me feel like I was always improving. 

Other than that, thank you guys for all the hard work!!",2021年1月2日22:19,5,A year later...

The customisation is great, from changing colors, to backgrounds, it's very customisable. The different modes also add extra fun, such as one saber and 360° mode. And, they added extra song packs with great songs such as High Hopes, American Idiot, and Believer. With all this content (and more) it's no wonder how this game got so big.

Build a level/difficulty! You would build your own track (using the soundtrack in the game) and you would use the joystick to move forward to build farther then you would place the block in front of you! You could add it so players can swap to different mechanics like bombs and the player would be able to rotate the blocks! I think that would be AWESOME!! Anyway I love this game!

I keep trying to up my previous scores while earning new scores on difficulties and modes I haven't even played yet (No Arrows mode is no joke with Ghost Notes turned on, still getting used to that one).

2022-05-24 16:58:49.729016,It is totally worth the price tag. I give it a five star rating because it is a game made for everyone and you don’t need to be really used to be to play it. It was my first vr game and it really is a great game to get into virtual reality especially with the quest 2 out now. I don’t know how it performs on the quest but it is certainly one of the best games for the quest 2. You can even mod it using a computer and it just adds more gameplay after what they already gave you. In my opinion it is one of the best if not the best vr game out there and it is well worth the $30 price tag because I already have like 30 hours of gameplay in just a few days. It is also a good game to grind on because it has endless possibilities. My favorite vr game and I hope it’s yours too.,2020年12月31日04:29,5,Great Game

2022-05-24 16:59:00.512537,Amazing game. Visually a lot better than PSVR and hand controllers miles better at picking up movements.

2022-05-24 16:59:52.741651,"So for a long time I really wanted this game and now I have vr I can experience it properly! Graphics, campaign and all that comes with the game is awesome! It's ticked majority of my boxes in expectations for it.

Now I know that making money is essential in a game especially when it's cheaper than your everyday Xbox, ps game who charge stupid money for decent games. Unless you can get it cheaper at places in uk like cex etc. But if I'm honest I was disappointed by the limited songs on beat saber.

I know 2 songs out of the 3 to 4 playlists I've got and majority of the songs sound exactly the same. Now, don't get wrong I've been playing these songs through.campaign and getting used to how best saber counts up points. But, I rely mainly on music to make me pumped about playing beat saber. It's the feel of the song, the moment I suppose.

So when exploring playlists of songs I do know and would love to play I've noticed the add ons are restricted to that one band, singer or song you like and if you want different music gotta add on extra. 

So add ons are a way to help the game make money I get, but I wish they'd mix and mash the music on playlists on that add on so your not restricted to buying multiple add ons for the sake of getting 3 songs you want to play you know?

That's the only issue I've had on this game. Otherwise I love it everything I expected bar the music ❤️",2021年2月3日16:26,4,It's brilliant but

The graphics are nice, and personally like competing against other people.

2022-05-24 17:01:58.677732,This game is very fun. My only suggestion would be to enable change of environment on online and campaigns . I personally don't like heights so the appearance of a drop off is very distracting ..even when I know its VR..I personally stay in the linkin park environment for this reason. There is 1 other environment that I can handle. Not a big deal for most people but it is for me especially when you have to move out of the way of objects. You can change that option if its bothersome. I found it helped. So if you feel those 2 issues are bothersome. You can adjust those but you cant change it with any online play. Unless there is a way that I haven't figured out yet. If anyone knows I would love to hear it..,2021年1月14日08:24,4,Very fun
2022-05-24 17:01:58.742635,"So disappointed with the music choices provided in the original purchase. To get the songs you want, you must jump thru hoops and alter the headset and game. The add ons you can purchase don't appear that great either. Maybe I'm new to this,  but it's my opinion after owning the game for a few days.",2021年1月13日23:38,4,Poor song selection in original purchase
2022-05-24 17:01:58.809498,"I could have sworn i wrote a review already but what ever, ive had more time to play it at this point to get a good feel out of the game.

First off, its amazing. Its a must buy for any VR owner who wants a game they can keep coming back to or share with a friend.

There's a fairly nice list of songs you can pick from with different modes as well. Its customizable like stages, colors and mods to the game to help change things up and they are adding more and more songs to play. I personally enjoy the Rocket League playlist.

The only reason why i cant give this game a full five stars is custom songs. The PC version of Beat Saber is far more enjoyable due to being able to add custom songs, stages and even swords in the game. Its why i own two versions of this game now, one for the Oculus Quest when i need to leave home for whatever reason, and the PC version to fully enjoy what the community can make. It adds so much extra value to the game that it sucks to see the state of custom songs on the Oculus Quest.

You can add custom songs to Oculus Quest, but its so tedious and time consuming that by the time you get it done it wasnt worth the effort, mostly because you'll be forced to start all over again the moment you turn it off. 

If i had to guess, it's probably because of Facebook its self, which really sucks. If there is a way they can make it easier in the future to do it i would use this version of the fame as my main version for sure.",2020年12月20日17:08,4,Almost Perfect

New packs are released every now and then but not enough as other players need to have the same songs installed ... It's great playing especially to the Monstercat dub step tracks but there isn't a great deal of variety in the bundled songs. . Would happily buy more content I'd it was available.

I thought there were more songs than what is on there. I saw they had some Green Day which was cool until I saw the songs they picked to put in the game, boulevard of broken dreams is a great song to listen to but to play a dancing rhythm VR game?? Not great. 

There was also Lincoln Park which I love but what a weird choice for a dancing game... 

The songs that are available to play are almost all by the same person. And they are fine, not good, not bad, they are just whatever. They don’t get me in the mood to dance or play.  

Better music needs to be added.",2021年1月19日06:23,3,Umm... What is this song selection???
2022-05-24 17:03:12.292434,I really think this is the best game on the oculus quest. But for it to actually be fun your need to mod your game which I don’t think oculus supports. You could get banned. Oculus should support the community in modding because I’m pretty sure the people who buy dlc aren’t having as much fun. Also the DLC are pretty expensive.,2020年12月2日07:52,5,This game is all I need an a vr

Boy was I wrong! I haven’t heard any of these songs before and they are all garbage, please include multiple genres of music in a free dlc because I think at $30 I deserve some decent tunes to play with. I wanted to jump off a bridge after hearing hundred dollar beels for the 20 th time. And what’s with the intentional mistake runs? Those aren’t fun, just annoying. it’s a shame that I played this game for longer than two hours, now I can’t get a refund. The reason I’m not rating one star is because I can download mods, thanks to them I can pair up the mechanics with some rock music and get the experience I was expecting.",2020年12月8日05:21,2,Just why?

2022-05-24 17:03:43.877790,"The core game for Beat Saber is fantastic— and other reviews have covered this well. Truly enjoy it, and it’s a great experience. 

However, the Green Day add-on module is awful, and for one reason really: the songs are censored to bleep out curse words. This wasn’t evident when purchasing the add-on, and the game play is awful. The bleeps completely take you out of the game, and frankly... come on. Using edited versions of the songs is ridiculous. 

I like Beat Saber, but I’m wary of future add-ons, especially because you cannot get a refund for them. Truly hope the company will either offer a choice on edited/non-edited songs in the future, or will stop using edited versions altogether.",2021年1月13日21:40,3,Great Game— Terrible GreenDay Add-On

In any other circumstance, I would give it 5 stars because it is a very enjoyable game and used to be one of my favourites. However since the recent update, the game is incredibly slow to/doesn't at all register my controllers movements, so whilst it would display the blades going through the boxes it would count them all as misses. This has rendered the game virtually unplayable as I end up losing within seconds of starting as I watch the blade pass through a box like there was nothing even there! I have never experienced these issues with similar Oculus games and it's really disappointing as it looks like I won't (more like can't) play Beat Saber anymore!",2020年11月8日19:24,1,Unplayable

This game is a must have if you own VR. Great visuals, fun with friends and alone. I great great workout. Very responsive and accurate. My 1 and ONLY complaint it that the song selection isnt broad enough. The only music pack kind of worth buying is Panic at the disco and Linkin Park, and maybe 2 Greenday songs. Great BTS variety for those Kpop lovers but tbh, if you’re not into rock, edm, or kpop, you’ll get tired of this game easily. They need more variety or an option for custom songs. Maybe like Just Dance, have a song suggestion page for fans to suggest songs? This game has so much potential to be unbeatable.",2020年11月30日10:57,5,MUST HAVE.

The sound, graphics, gameplay is just wow! The only reason I've not given 5 stars is that the music library is quite small, and though there is dlc, it's not cheap, when the game is already over mid price range. If the game was £12/13, I would give 5 stars but fir the price it is and to charge almost up to £10 for some dlc, consisting of 5/6 songs, you could spend easily £40-50 to have a decent library and variety. Still, get this game but maybe wait for offer.",2021年1月9日22:47,4,"Almost perfect,"

I feel alive again with the movements and the music! Very fun and challenging for all ages and fitness levels (maybe some won't like the music).

I dont understand why BTS, Lincoln Park, and Greenday were the bands the company decided to invest in... They are more ""Rock Band"" type songs. BTS is ok but they are also super expensive. Also the difficulty from easy-normal is almost nothing. Hard is easy on some songs.. other songs it feels more like advanced.

BUT I don't think that the pricing is fair. I think there should be a connection between price and production value. 
- The reason for 3 stars: This is basically a really simple game AND there are a very limited number of songs included! 
Hence if it was priced at half the current price it would be the best buy ever. The ability to have/add extra (royalty-free/custom made) songs free of charge would also make it feel more worth the premium price. For now, you can buy extra song packs at about the same price that a full album cost back in the day when people bought a full album - and that is way too expensive...",2021年1月11日23:40,3,"Great game, but..."

But the game has a few minor details that are easily glossed over. First, 60% of the levels are locked behind paywalls, so if you don't have cash to spare, your stuck playing the levels on the base games 5 soundtracks. After playing the game for a while, these songs get stale. This leads me to my second issue with this game, specifically on the Quest platforms. There is no custom song support other than modding the game with 3rd party programs (but thats against the privacy policy, and sometimes don't work), which keep the players stuck in the base game. Other than these issues, great game, but if you're going to buy it, setup Oculus Link and buy the game through Steam.",2021年1月8日12:44,4,"Great game, but missing a few things."

3/5 for the interface. After you finish a solo music and return to the main screen it’s hard to find your score. It does not show if you did better or not than the last time you played that music and it does not show your progress to beat that music. 
3/5 game design. Campaign was badly designed. The difficulty progress too fast so you got stuck for a long time in a song. No option to select musics to play in sequence, if you want to exercise for one hour, for example. Practice mode should have a pause option so you can learn the complex sequences. 
1/5 help and instructions. No help. The game is easy to learn but if you need information about something, you need to figure it out trying. For example the points you make when you cut a box. Good luck trying to discover what gives a top score.",2021年1月11日02:10,3,Good game but limited experience

2022-05-24 17:06:21.283538,Love the mechanics of the game and the visuals... but there are hardly any songs for $30 and you have to BUY $10+ packs that contain  a hand full of songs. Guitar hero was a much better bargain.,2021年2月4日12:53,3,"Great game play, little song library."
2022-05-24 17:06:21.356311,"The game is great sure, but honestly for 30 bucks it could be expected to get some new tracks occasionally. And i mean for free! Even if it is only one track every few months but always paying for every single new track they make is kinda bold in my opinion. There are lots of games you can experience way more stuff than in beatsaber and they offer you a lot of free stuff with their updates (which are free). 
So eventually this game gets boring pretty fast if you‘re not willing to pay all the time for new songs.",2020年11月23日22:45,2,Fun but way to expensive for what it is

As far as I know, side loading songs doesn’t work on Quest 2. :) I know, it’s a shame, but music royalties aren’t cheap & artists are hurting for money right now with no concerts, album sales obsolete, & companies like Spotify shafting them with fees.

2022-05-24 17:08:16.920524,"First off, this game is a blast. Truly intuitive and the best example of using VR that I have seen.

Now the downside that really got me: The songs are censored with a loud beep (not ""hushed"" like they do on the radio), there is no option to turn off the censoring, there is no refunds on DLC. This wouldn't bother me but I bought the Green day pack and well . . . Green day isn't exactly family friendly and the beep really kills the vibe. Poor artist selection for a family friendly game. That pack was a waste of money and I'm not even going to touch Lincoln park.

Beyond that the song selection is limited and the DLC is overpriced.",2020年11月22日10:19,4,A ton of fun with a downside
2022-05-24 17:08:27.144275,"I have really enjoyed playing this game in my quest 2. The action is great the songs are great. The fact that there is a small campaign section is awesome. However, I would really like for there to be a random song selection option in solo play. That way I select random,a song pops up I select the difficulty level and then go. No downtime scrolling around for a song I haven't played today and thus losing the momentum of play.

Update: Jan 2021- I play on a quest 2 and I have friends that play on a Rift S. We can play each other in multi player mode, but we can't see each others high scores in the solo play section. This needs to be fixed.",2021年1月19日10:12,2,Competitive and solo play

1) The music pack prices - When playing beat saber there isn’t a lot of different music so you  are opted to buy the music packs which are a bit pricey.

2) It isn’t cross-buy. This sort of speaks for itself as to why it is an issue. 

Other than that I HIGHLY recommend this game! Buy it now!!!!!!!",2020年12月19日06:39,5,Multiplayer spectating is laggy

When you find those songs that you've never heard before and they just hit you right and you get a rhythm going, it's the best. It's also good for a nice workout; the higher tier songs will really push your upper and lower body to move and get those swings.

It lasts for about 5 seconds of them doing their own thing then it will come back in a bit and do it again. I still love the game but I just wanted to tell you about the bug.

2022-05-24 17:10:33.228266,"I honestly don't have much to say: the title says it all.  The maps are amazing and quite beautiful with obvious skill and talent behind it.  I love the way that it is set up so that anyone can understand how to do any level with any difficulty AND modification AND mode they wish (for the most part).  That brings me to the next part of the review.  I know that y'all at Beat Saber HQ (or whatever it is) are kept relatively busy with other maps, but I would love it if you could do one handed, 360, 90, and no arrows on some of the maps that don't have it (for example, I would love for  ""Cycle Hit"" to be one handed as that is one of my favorite maps).

Other than that, I love your game, five stars regardless of my complaint.  If anyone reads this and has not purchased this game I have one thing to say: THIS IS A MUST BUY.  The campaign alone provided several DAYS worth of entertainment given the length and varying difficulties.  When you do Freeplay, I kid you not, there is almost limitless fun and entertainment with so many different ways to customize a single level it is insane.  BORED?!

I must say though, if you have the quest 2, id highly recommend getting it on steam and playing it via the link cable. The reason being for this is steam has workshop that is free, and oculus charges you for each additional song.",2021年1月2日14:24,4,Great Game But...
2022-05-24 17:11:46.666092,"I would say first, the game itself is great and if that was want this review was solely based on it would be a five. Unfortunately, this is based off the whole system, which is multi faceted. 

Gameplay: Like I said, I really enjoy this game. It’s something that I can do for as long as I have stamina to keep playing. Both my wife and I really enjoy the variety of songs and, honestly, breaking a sweat while playing. I’ll get frustrated sometimes when a slice should count but for whatever reason it didn’t, but it’s not like you have limited lives...just play again. 

Since getting an Quest 2: Like I’m sure many people over the based few months, I upgraded to the Quest 2 and my wife and I were excited to finally be able to play together with the new multiplayer mode. But wait you can’t play with each other if it’s the same account, so instead Beat Saber forces you to be in a different account instead of assigning localized user s for its multiplayer mode. In addition, like many other oculus games, don’t utilize cloud syncing for connecting saved game data. 

I understand this sounds petty but it feels like Beat games didn’t think through their roll out of multiplayer and people upgrading to the quest 2 while still keeping the Quest. When contacting support that were short and dismissive about that every changing.

So 2 stars",2021年1月5日08:39,2,Multiplayer isn’t want it seems

2022-05-24 17:12:07.743943,"I absolutely love this game, I am totally addicted to it. I have only been playing for 4 months but already have around 100 hours in the game. It is a stable part of my workout, as it is great cardio (if you don't just stand still and flick your wrists of course) and my arms have gotten considerably more toned. I love the competitive part of it too, playing the crazier and crazier custom maps, climbing the ranks... There is an amazing community out there. I will probably play this game for a long, long time.

With that being said, here is some of the stuff I don't like:
- The new UI is awful imho. I liked the old one much better, so I actually switched back to the previous version.
- I don't know why Facebook is making it so hard for Quest users. The main selling point of the game is custom songs, since there is not that much content in the game itself. Without custom songs, this game would not be nearly as popular as it is. But now, I cannot play multiplayer and I cannot compete on OST leaderboards, because the game is modded.
- As for multiplayer, I did try it before going back to the previous version. It was fun, I enjoyed it, but after a week of playing, it kind of got boring to play the same songs over and over.
- OST Ex+ maps are kind of bad for the most part. They are all over the place, don't have a nice flow, etc. I wish they improved them.
- The music in the game is not that great, except for a couple songs.

I guess that's it. I love the game anyway so I have to give it 5 stars.
Oh and fair warning: once you start playing Ex and Ex+, make sure you warm up properly and stretch afterwards. I suffered a pretty bad back injury from playing which took a long time to heal. (And of course there is the constant arm, shoulder and wrist pain from playing too much...)",2020年11月29日21:43,5,Addictive

2022-05-24 17:12:18.375783,"I really like playing this game, good for exercise and ofc having fun. You guys can add more songs tho! Would really like to see Blackpink’s “The Album” to be release. Would recommend playing this game!",2021年1月19日17:16,4,Best game
2022-05-24 17:12:18.447622,"Amazing game, but after a while the video is guttering!! I have 200mbps internet speed so that’s not the problem! Reinstalled the game, nope! Guess I’m waiting on an update!!! Other than that great game and can’t wait to beat my friends scores... after I stop vomiting from the graphics guttering!!",2021年1月5日04:25,3,Great at first
2022-05-24 17:12:28.666079,"This really is a fun game but feels like only half  done. They have a lot of playing options like playing straight on or having the board coming at you at 90° or 360°.  I have found I like the 90° play style the best. Thing is- only some of the songs have it and the ones that do only offer one difficulty. You can’t work your way up on these different play styles. Some of the songs are only offered in expert or expert+ which I don’t stand a chance. I want to play these songs and advance difficulty when I get better- but again, they don’t have these options. 
If you only want to play in “1-dimension” then this game is great! Being an oculus game though, I would have hoped it would have been developed for 360.",2021年1月4日06:07,3,Great game but only 1-dimensional

2022-05-24 17:12:28.803332,"If it weren't for the fact that adding custom songs is relatively easy I wouldn't do a 5 star rating, more of the newer music packs should be released free with the game.

2022-05-24 17:13:21.118416,It’s laggy and the hand controls always have to be adjusted. There’s better games that run smoother for cheaper. Stop focusing on adding new song and fix the game.,2021年2月2日16:50,2,Would give it 5 but
2022-05-24 17:13:21.187964,I started playing this game on pave but the tracking wasn’t great and now that i have the quest the game is at least 5 times better and it was already great this is a must have for whatever platform you are on its just so much fun mainly when you get good at it and yes you might get frustrated at times when in a really hard level but just keep trying and trying you’ll finish it one day,2020年11月20日09:44,5,Just amazing

I do wish you can play custom songs made by the community like you'd see on yt, but you only get the certain songs and modes that it gives you, I really do wish that they could at least add more songs for free.",2020年12月16日06:56,4,It's good but...

2022-05-24 17:14:03.175159,This game is really fun but people that give this game 1 star is cause there bad and can't even hit a block and the think it's the game. There just mad bad and sad but if you actually play the game you'll be able to hit a block. I bet the people that give this game one star only played for 20 min. Well so that's my uhh.... Review.... Well... You should play it heheh. Ok this has gone on for too long.,2020年12月17日04:36,5,People that give one star are bad atgame

I just wish they had a better selection of songs. Also I wish they had a no kill stage where you can keep rocking to the beat and trying to the end even if you are terrible, without it stopping because you lost. A no score level if you will.",2021年3月25日23:58,5,Awesome

2022-05-24 17:14:34.618197,"UPDATE: Even after recently adding Panic At The Disco, you can see such a genre pattern. How about some old school, disco, 80s/90s Pop Music. I rarely play this anymore as I'm bored of it. I just purchased Audio Trip and even though it has a very small selection of tracks, they're great songs. It's actually pitiful we have to wait this long for better content. 

Don’t get me wrong, this really is an amazing game but they offer an abundance of songs by unknown artists. They’ve been promising for months more music with real artists are coming soon but here we are, still only a small selection.",2020年11月24日00:06,2,Boring music selection

Who knrew that would be one of the most fun things to do? Multiplayer makes it even better, pushing people harder since they're in competition, or maybe just to play it with your friends. The game is so addictive they have made a whole community of people dedicated to maximize what you can do in the game. Custom songs, sabers, notes, maps, everything! I truly hope they can go farther in their games, or/and just keep improving this one. You guys really made a masterpiece.",2020年12月11日16:05,5,It really is a great game.

2022-05-24 17:15:16.943437,So beat saber has lots of hype because of how popular it is. I totally agree with this (it’s a good game) but I have like 2 complaints. The first one is that sometimes the sabers don’t hit their target even though it’s an obvious hit (correct direction). That may be a fault of the oculus controller tracking though. My second and final complaint is that it can get very boring after playing for a short time. I don’t really have any ideas of adding content but that’s what I have to say. Ok have a good day everyone!,2020年12月29日05:39,4,Pretty good game

I never really thought about how I looked playing it until she pointed out how cruel it is that the game itself is so awesome but you look hilarious flailing your arms around... besides the flailing it is truly a great enjoyable game that anyone can play no matter who you are. If you can fit a headset on your head and can hold 2 contollers, you need this game.",2020年12月11日03:21,5,Great until someone starts watching...
2022-05-24 17:15:37.877783,This app needs way better music ASAp. Free music at that. When you're not paying for hard copies or packaging no digital game should be more than $10. Period. Especially when it runs this slow and all the music sounds alike and the tracking and syncronization is off kilter. Game definitely requires more development. And different environment options. For free. Facebook stop nickel and dimeing us. Give us what the major video gaming manufacturers provide. I mean the price tag on this thing that only one person can see and use at a time has to work with us not against us. Otherwise it is not worth it.,2020年12月15日11:22,3,Music sucks

The game is fun for a few months, and the graphics are pretty good. After about 5 months and maybe a hundred hours of play time, it gets annoying. If you don't purchase any music packs, you start to realize after a while how little choices you have for songs.  I becomes absurd when your PAID $25 game has more DLC than the base game. What!?!? OST 1 has horrible and awkward mapping too so I never play any songs from that playlist. Also, if you are playing multiplayer and they pick a song you don't own, you just have to sit in silence. I'm sure there is a lot of legal stuff for why that happens, but it's just annoying. Another nit-pick is the sabers are just huge. It's never good when your game is improved by so much by modders and many have opted for that route.",2021年1月3日11:27,3,The Game Is Okay At Most

Big issue is the lack of licensed music tracks. Yeah, yeah I can sidequest and load custom songs but I don't feel like that should be the way to expand the game or get, what iI feel, any kind of worth out of my money. 

To be honest I'd pay a subscription for some real tracks. Or how about do DLC with good music but Include a bunch of songs not just 5 or 6??  

I understand people have to make money but c'mon! I can't even get the songs that I paid for to get selected in multiplayer. Game seems to always pick a built in song over any DLC music.",2020年12月29日07:34,3,Great game but lacks content

2022-05-24 17:18:47.271633,"The latest updates with Multiplayer ruined the game. Now it is extremely laggy on Quest, practically unplayable above hard level.
Not recommended.

Update: I revaluate the game from 2 to 1 star - hate. The now irritating game is lag-miss-miss experience. I cannot get even close  to just a single of my previous achievements on expert and hard. Challenges are ruined too. The game turned into a complete waste on money.",2020年11月9日00:36,1,Severe lags after the latest MP updates
2022-05-24 17:18:47.343637,"I cant tell you anything different than the other 5 star reviews. Ive been playing beat saber for about a year now and I absolutely love this game.

Only ONE downside, which is more like a personal thing and not directly related to the game itself [thus why the rating isn't effected] I wish I could live stream this game to my Facebook like other games. I guess its a copywrite issue? If I bought the music, and credit is clearly given on screen, whats the issue?

I just want to play beat saber in the company of my friends and family so they can watch me play LIVE. Instead I record then share to Facebook.
I wish I could send my longer videos directly in messenger.

Apparently only recordings less than 2 minutes can be sent via messenger. I wish that limit would expand to at least 5 minutes so I could send some of my recordings just directly TO someone rather to my Facebook timeline.

Again this was entirely a personal thing and has no direct correlation to the game itself. The game itself is phenomenal, I utilize bmbf at times but only on original quest. My quest 2 is purely all oculus content and songs. I love it either way.

63/5 stars",2020年11月22日01:46,5,10/5 stars anyday
2022-05-24 17:18:47.415219,"I really do like beat saber, it's a great game to get into VR with, and it's very satisfying to slice virtual blocks the beat of a song. But if I'm going to be honest, it just got a bit boring, until now. The multiplayer online mode is amazing, and has rekindled my passion for beat saber. There is little to no lag when I play, and the added competition you get in multiplayer mode really brings beat saber up a notch. If you eere ever skeptical about getting beat saber before, I assure you this game is totally worth it.",2020年12月7日02:24,5,New Multiplayer is Amazing

I was so wrong. It exceeded every expectation I had. Beat saber is so much fun, and with custom songs the variety will never end. Beat saber is the best vr game in my opinion, and it's one of my favorite games of all time.",2021年1月14日10:55,5,Amazing

I have a YouTube channel that has 3 beat saber videos and I gained 3 subs off of 1 of them. I would like for you to subscribe and you can see my skill that has improved sooooo much.

Really unfair for newcomers like me. And on top of the 30 +tax I paid you need to pay an EXTRA 20 dollars for a music pass to get songs you like. It’s really unfair. I honestly think that’s after paying 30 dollars you should be able to play all songs on there.",2021年4月5日02:08,3,Okay.

It also has the worst music selection (and the music packs are limited in appeal), and is the most expensive. The thing that makes up for it is the light sabers: let’s face it, light sabers are cool. There’s something satisfying in slicing the blocks that is absent from the other games. If it wasn’t for that I’d say skip this and go with one of the other two that have better music and a wider variety of interactions.

2022-05-24 17:21:35.739003,"Beat saber is a great game that gets you moving, it was the first game I got on the occulus and makes you feel like you are really holding a couple of light sabers, however. I was really disappointed at the lack of recognisable music, I know it seems good that the soundtrack is original, but when quite a few of the tracks are really boring to play over and over again it takes away from wanting to complete them. The chosen selection of music you can buy isn't much better. The main reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is the way that, every now and then, one or both of the sabers misses, not due to my ineptitude, it just seems to go through the block without registering. This pretty much ruins the game for me as I will never beat my friends high scores when I can't get a perfect run, but I keep playing because it's pretty much the only exercise I get. From the look of online forums this has been a problem for a long time.",2020年12月21日09:31,4,Great game... apart from...

2022-05-24 17:21:57.012996,"Quest was made for this, not the other way around. :)

This is the best music game,

BUT and its a big butt for me...

Other than some of the main songs like Ghost and Immortal, there's not many tracks at all for this price.

There's way more potential for other tunes, but again  the song prices are extortionate if you're buying dlc packs, and there's not many either. I imagined there would be similar to the old songstar games, 100s of tracks to choose from.

Players deserve more free tracks added to the base game, as there's only 4 main albums to play. I can get through them all once each in a single sitting each time I play.

Still a 5 star game minus 1 for being super tight...
Come on dev you made a mint with this game, please give your fan base some new tracks.",2020年11月30日11:10,4,No point having a quest without this.

2022-05-24 17:22:07.297466,This game is amazingly fun! You will not get bored when playing it.

2022-05-24 17:22:07.591619,"It was fun while it lasted. Probably due to me liking songs I actually know and can either hum or sing along with.
The game concept is pretty fun but due to the removal of custom songs (you can use BMBF to load them on but they said they will permanently ban your oculus account) you would think they will work to push more official songs out. You will probably get 5 new songs from someone you don’t care about every few months. (Also charges you the price of a quarter of the game itself for one song)
Like where are newer K/DA songs?
How about Black Pink?
Get this game for PC like the vive. Better off with something like synth riders that supports custom songs.",2020年11月5日14:46,1,Lack Of Songs

In terms of exercise; most definitely! I weigh 71kg and I can get to a burn rate of around 12calories at a min speaking to 14 calories a minute.

You dont have to get bmbf, but why not. It takes a bit of effort to do but is very much worth it. Just unlocks so much more playing potential.",2020年11月30日18:47,5,Simple idea done so well.

2022-05-24 17:23:20.941862,My impression after playing about two hours is underwehlmed. The rythmic set of sounds  (I refuse call it music) demotevates to continue playing. Slicing doesn't affect the songs no matter if you slice perfectly or if you miss. The songs won't sound better or distorted or in any way diffrently. As of now it just a decent game to get warmed up for a real work out.,2020年12月30日07:48,2,I don't feel it

2022-05-24 17:25:06.327098,This is as most people who play it will agree one of the best first VR games. As a new person to VR this was the first game me and my kids bought.

2022-05-24 17:25:06.473496,"That’s all I have to say. You need this. I have had this game for maybe 5-6 months and I have played it every single day I use my VR. It’s an amazing game because of the endless game time, and now multiplayer mode. This is literally the best game on VR as of right now. When do you ever get to slice blocks left and right up and down perfectly to the beat of a pumping sound track? Also the various modes from easy, normal, hard, expert, expert+. The campaign is great, solo is even better, and the fact that there is different colors, environments, and modes such as “no arrows” or “ghost notes” is just perfect. If your contemplating on getting this game, I’ll make the decision for you. Your buying it.",2021年1月21日13:37,5,YOU NEED THIS GAME.
2022-05-24 17:25:06.548180,"This game is amazing no matter what oculus device you are on. The songs are great and it really gets your heart pumping. The only thing that I gripe about is I think they should add a custom map player into the game without mods. It would bring so much more to the table, even though the table is so full, you would need extensions to put more stuff on it.",2020年11月28日11:03,5,Great Game But.........
2022-05-24 17:25:16.770291,"This game is addictive. I have been playing this game for a long time, while every song is unique along with the rhythm you can cut in. My favorite songs are crystallized bye Camellia, Light it up by Camellia, and The greatest show by Panic At the Disco, but the gold medal of my favorite is Light it up. I have constantly been trying to figure out the pattern on expert + as this song is rushing, quick, and it makes you feel good about yourself and your progress at the beginning. It’s one of those songs that make it look like you are inside of the blocks as it looks like it is impossible to beat it. Although to be honest, it looks more satisfying watching others doing it on multiplayer as the almost never miss a block. Overall, I know I focused on one song, but this game is great, and I really hope many can try it.",2020年11月27日11:50,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 17:25:16.841148,"This game is addicting and a stupid amount of fun. Its like Guitar Hero and Star Wars had a weird baby.  While I am not a big fan of the main genre of music it has the music its self is fun by all means.  
 My wife doesn't like video games and had 0 interest in the VR but I knew she would like Beat Sabre. After much peer pressure I finally guiltled her into trying it.....then she played it for over 2hrs straight her first go, she loved it!  I now catch her sneaking into playing whenever she gets a chance!   
It's good wholesome fun your whole family can enjoy, well worth the 30 bucks!",2020年11月27日16:59,5,Stupid amount of fun

2022-05-24 17:25:27.514124,"I find it unfair that oculus only updates beat saber on the oculus 2. They leave original oculus players with a downgraded beat saber with many glitches, the biggest one being the saber is not tracked and phases through many cubes, causing users to fail. I’m very unhappy about this. Please fix this glitch.",2020年12月18日00:44,2,Too many glitches to be enjoyable
2022-05-24 17:25:27.590041,"Beat Saber is near perfect but there are two issues 1. Custom songs would make this perfect 2. More variety in how the levels are ( I mean speed switching and color change in the middle of levels and extra things like that.)Look if you have an oculus quest get the game or you will miss out on one of the best VR experiences out there. Trust me when I say it is a must get.

EDIT: I just want to say that I never played the demo of the game and I did today and I’m a bit mad. The demo has better graphics than the game and it looks very clean but the game just looks half assed when compared. This is kind of lying to the players when this happens because the demo shows what will be in the game and the game should have the content in the demo and without it, such as lower quality graphics, it can be disappointing when you buy the game only to see it look half assed. If the devs see this I’m just saying that you should either bump up the graphic quality for the game, or lower it for the demo because this is lying to the buyer and that’s just dead wrong. This would be a five star rating if it actually fixed this issue but for now I’m leaving it at a four star rating.",2020年11月30日05:00,4,If you don’t have this game BUY IT NOW!

2022-05-24 17:26:51.627031,"I first played Beat Saber on the PS VR. I fell in love, and knew I had to get it for my Oculus. I knew that the controller tracking would be different, and that it would take me a bit to get used to, but I've been noticing that there are just some blocks I can't hit in certain songs. It annoys me a bit, but that's also because I'm super competitive and it brings my scores down, haha. I will also voice the same opinion that many other players have and say that there needs to be more music variety available, preferably for free. Beat Saber's baseline price is expensive, and a lot of people can't afford to get music packs with music they like on top of that. If there was a wider variety of music available for free, I feel like a lot more players would be more satisfied with the game, myself included. Overall though, I still think the purchase is worth it :) It's a fun game for sure.",2020年12月18日07:25,4,A great game with some minor downsides

2022-05-24 17:28:26.751521,So far beat saber is my favorite game. I'd give it a 5 but they really disappointed with the multiplayer update. Playing other people is awesome but they don't have a chat/mic option in the game. You have to start an Oculus party with friends in order to be able to talk to each other.

The game is clean and free of bugs. There's lots of music and an active modding community for limitless songs. It's simple, yet a perfect game. If you just got a vr headset, start here.

Even so, having logged 150+ hours, I’m still struggling to get past the built in levels* on Expert+. This game requires immense practice and patience, and also good stamina. 

*You can mod your game to allow fan made levels, which can be nigh impossible except for a handful of players

This happened to me btw: If you ever try playing and have huge trouble on songs you used to be able to do, here’s some advice. Wait it out. Play songs slowed down or a difficulty below what you are used to, so as to not lose interest/skill. Do this for about a week, or until you feel ready to get back on the hard levels. It’s similar to writers block, but Beat Saber version.",2020年11月24日04:14,5,"Great Game, But Requires Practice"
2022-05-24 17:28:47.584677,"So I first started watching people play this game on VR, and I can see why people play!
It super addictive and a must have VR game. 
I am around a Expert-Expert+ player (not to brag :v) and trust me, it's a CHALLENGE.
Camiella, if that's how it's spelled, is difficult as well.
If you want a challenge I reccomend 'WHAT THE CAT?!', Cycle Hit', both on Expert. Also 'Breezer' on Expert+. 
Online mode is fun and a challenge, some people are AMAZING! 
One thing, the buying levels. I hate that if you don't have the level on Online Mode, you just stare at people. 
Not playing the level is one thing, however..
You can't hear the song or even see the blocks there hitting. 
I think you should at least be able to see the blocks and hear the songggg...
yeahhh...
i'm needy i knowww..
Anyways! I wanna get the P!ATD pack because everyone seems in love with those songs for some reason! (Huge P!ATD fan over here) EHM!
Besides that; TO THE BUGS!
No bugs except for one thing in Online mode.
I don't know if it's just me or not, but~
After you play a level with everyone and it says 'Select Level' and 'Ready!' it doesn't let you click either. It just glitches out and like freezes. That's all. 
I have an idea (YOUR AMAZING IF YOUR STILL READING THIS xD) 
You should be able to add friends IN-GAME. Just so if you like someone you can friend them. 
With that, you should be able to report people. They can be rude and innapropriate. (you know who you are..)
Another thing! Kinda like 'Among Us' where you can make a game 'Private' or 'Public', do that. So you can play with friends AND others.
Anyways! Thanks for reading if your still here! I'm a handfull aren't I- 


xD",2020年11月23日11:40,5,Awesome~!
2022-05-24 17:28:47.658089,"You may be wondering ""is this game something I will enjoy?"" why yes, yes it is. No matter what type of vr player you are, Beat Saber is just for you. It has engaging gameplay that will get you emersed. It even has songs you may already know and like (although they are dlc). Also I do not recommend modding it. The reason being is nodding it will remove that feature. Take it from me who modded it before hand, multiplayer is what shines in this game.

Also if you are looking for a challenge look nowhere but to the campaign! Campaign mode give you the songs you know from beatsaber and makes you wish they was harder! What campaign mode does is it starts out easy but gets harder and harder as it goes. It even has levels where your goal is to move your hand a lot, then slam your face with levels that are the complete opposite and you can't move that much! Its really fun and I wish they would add more challenges. -REVIEW OVER-",2020年11月23日22:24,5,A simple review for a simple man.

Almost no interaction, messed up difficulty levels between Camellia and other songs, nothing to do after fail. Networking is to slow to actually get an impression on other players movements. Broken in a multitude of ways. Also Tracking on Quest will be not good enough to beat all Expert+ Levels. I move differently in the Quest version than in the PC version to prevent tracking loss.

Once I had exhausted all the free options that seemed interesting to me at the time, I decided to go ahead and purchase my very first oculus quest game. Having seen many videos and many YouTubers playing this game I decided to give Beat Saber a try. In my opinion, it is a must-have for any VR owner who enjoys music/rhythm games. The gameplay is very simple to learn, but incredibly hard to master. The visuals are stunning and completely immersive.

It’s a fun, challenging, affordable game that you can play alone or in groups. 
Fundamentally this is best game you can buy for Oculus Quest/ Quest 2 it can be played at any ability level. You can put someone who has never experienced VR in the demo mode on easy and they will be able to understand enjoy it on from the first attempt. ￼
I have literally tried it with both my parents (who are in their 60’s and they couldn’t get enough). 
At the same time I can play every level at Expert + and it’s remains as enjoyable as when I first started. I love it and without exaggeration I play it every time I play VR. I use it as a warm up to get my dexterity and coordination going before I play other games.

I know the music industry has an iron fist with music rights and all which is fine.  I am older and have a huge music library I purchased over the years.  I see there is an AI program that map the songs to the music for Beat Saber on the web.  If you could incorporate that into your game so players can listen to their own purchased music without having to go through the Developers only stuff, your game would be infinitely better.  Thank you again for a great experience.  I would pay extra for the feature but it needs to be seamless if it  is an add on.

Then I gave it another go recently and somehow got completely hooked. I think the Camellia songs in the solo game pushed me over the edge, as well as the ""extras"" set including the Crab Rave and Fitbeat. Since then I've been playing it for over an hour every day and absolutely loving it.

The only slight downside is that uploading custom songs and maps requires the use of Sidequest, when ideally this would be integrated into the game like on other music-based games such as Audio Trip. I've done it successfully with Beat Saber and it really unlocks the game's true potential.",2020年11月20日06:37,5,The best longevity on the Quest

2022-05-24 17:31:35.974737,"This is the first review I’ve ever wrote so sorry if it’s bad. 

Beat saber is an amazing rhythm game with the objective being hitting notes that come towards you with lightsabers. It’s really addictive. Beat Games also add new tracks often with newest additions being BTS, Linkin Park, Timbaland and so many more. Sadly all the music packs are paid but the OST tracks are free and some of them are really good. Multiplayer is a good update but I feel like this should have been in the game on launch but that’s just me. Sadly modding isn’t available on quest and quest 2 and is only available via apps like side quest but oculus don’t support it and it will disable multiplayer. Overall beat saber is a must buy",2020年11月19日01:39,5,Too good of a game.

Most people would be happy to pay for songs that they like. It's money that they can make and will help encourage people not to use side loading.

My first recommendation is ""Loona.""
After playing through every song and sideloaded on a quest, I believe the best songs are K-pop, pop and dance music. Although I am a big rock lover, it does not suit the game well.",2020年12月4日22:49,4,Best game going

Ended up getting the 50,000 at the start and then sitting down and swinging my arms side to side the rest of the song not even trying to hit anything. Awful mechanic.

Yesss get on the next day to try and keep making campaign progress, what’s the next song? You intentionally can’t combo over 25... why are you wanting ppl to SUCK at the game? Are you following suit with the awful “everyone gets a trophy” mentality? You either suck or you don’t, if you suck, get better.

I know this feeling all to well because I have a close friend who is in the top 200 in the world and he is world beyond me and when I see him play it makes me think it’s impossible but his constant encouragement has shown me its not that hard.

2022-05-24 17:33:31.941136,I would love If they put custom sabers and beats in the base game because(dont flame me) way for modding is kind of hard. All I ask is if the dev's could make at least 2 or 3 customs for each. That would be great. Overall tho this game is amazing and you should buy it.,2020年11月20日07:49,5,Make custom sabers and blocks built in

It was going well until I lost, and I had no idea how, I hit the note as I saw them. I played it again and realized they added a feature so the direction of the notes will change in the livery last second, giving you no time to actually hit them. The game became more luck than skill at that point because you had to guess which way the block would turn. Completely ruined me even wanting to play on the oculus and just got off. I think that new feature with the blocks changing at the last second ruins the game entirely and I’m not going to play the game until the next update to see if the have fixed their previously fun game.",2020年10月15日00:30,1,Good until new multiplayer update

I was sad when they did not add cross-buy for quest, but I wanted to support them so I bought it again anyway and understand how difficult programming is. They have been making great movement towards adding new music packs to help support different audiences. Which is exactly what the game needs. Unfortunately none of this new music is included in the game so to get the most out of the game you have to purchase the game and then music packs. The packs do go on sale so that is worth keeping in mind and in my opinion they are worth it. They nailed the gameplay of this game, it just needs more music and it seems like they are working hard on that through add-ons.",2020年11月29日23:45,4,One of my favorite games.. but the music

2022-05-24 17:34:45.724561,"I love Beat Saber, but I kinda love it in spite of itself. I have several friends who play it several times a week, and they’ve all stopped since the new update.

I have a Rift and a Quest. My partner uses my Rift (hates the Quest) and my other partner bought her own Quest. So I have two people to play with, right??

No. Rift and Quest can’t play together, although the game never tells you, so enjoy getting an error message for 20 mins before you figure it out. Only same headsets can play together. WTF?

Well at least I can play with my partner with her own Quest right? NOPE! Because the only reason she (or any of us) like the game is because of custom tracks. I don’t need them on my Quest because I have it on Rift and that’s enough for me. But my partner doesn’t have that option, so she either can play a game with me during a pandemic without any songs she likes, or play alone with all the tracks she loves. It’s the worst situation.

So I decided to rate Beat Saber on its own terms, as it’s decided to present itself to us. If cross play (even between headsets from the same company) isn’t an option, and custom songs take away our ability to play together, then this game has taken away the additions it promised and what little made us like it in the first place. 

When you have 4 headsets between you (5 if you count my old Vive) and none of them can play together, your multiplayer update ISN’T MULTIPLAYER.",2020年10月17日22:02,2,New Update Exposed BS’s Flaws

However, Expert is almost unplayable on the Oculus Quest 2. I'm constantly losing my sabers, or they get stuck to my side. I've tried reaching out to both Oculus and Beat Saber about the issue, and I've been ignored. It's a shame, really. This issue renders the game pretty much unplayable",2020年12月2日08:58,2,"Love the game, but..."

I might or might not of modded beat saber because it was fun and gave more challenge, but oculus updated there policys so I cant put mods on anymore. Its really ashame that they don't give an option to pick custom song because now its pay, pay, pay for the newest stuff. If you want people to have fun on your game don't restrict songs for people because they cant afford or buy it. Maybe every now and then you can put in a pack or 2 but there's so many packs that it just feels like they are money hungry.",2020年10月14日11:39,2,Very disappointed

Now you won't know on which difficulty you reached what rank or which songs you haven't tried yet.

What a terrible idea, instead of using that to promote songs and actually make people buy them. Hence, 2 Stars for now.",2020年10月14日21:13,2,Easily a five star game. But...

When I purchased the game i started off at normal and made my way to expert but ive also been watching people play on pc and noticed some stuff.

YOU WANT THIS.

Like the BTS and Linkin Park etc... still have downloadable albums but maybe have a bigger catalogue that you can unlock with levels? Makes the game more of a challenge you want more songs? Get better at the levels you already have, already unlocked all the songs? Why not buy our add one??

2022-05-24 17:36:09.804843,So I love this pack but a father a few days there was an update on my headset Q1 and Q2 and since then the hit detection has made beat saber virtually unplayable. I'm an E+ player so no novice but my sabers were phasing through the blocks and I'm getting misses that I know I've hit.

2022-05-24 17:36:09.970977,"I love beat saber and it's great for showing people that never did VR. No explanation needed someone can jump right in and play. I think it would be so cool if you could choose between light sabers, plasma sword, axes, and other melee weapons. Now I love using the lightsaber's but it would be so cool to have options.",2020年11月8日23:09,5,Would be so cool to have options.
2022-05-24 17:36:10.046774,"Update: the new online mode is excellent and suddenly brings a whole new challenge and fun to the game. It would be nice to be able to enter a lobby with people who agree on which sets of songs to choose from as there are a few tracks i loath and yet seem to always get selected by other players (I’m looking at you “where’s the cat” and others in that same vein) - but I can always quit a match so it’s not that big a deal.

Previous review:

I bought this originally for the PSVR and enjoyed it. With the Oculus Quest offering more accurate tracking etc, I bought it again and it plays so much better.

The newer 360 and 90 degree modes add a great new aspect that I hadn’t experienced before too.

I have found you need a lot of space to play the 360 degree tracks ‘safely’ - but well worth it. The patterns used in those feel especially rewarding when you get them going fluidly.

For anyone struggling with missing blocks etc - I found the controllers don’t like rechargeable batteries, and you might have to learn to reach out in front of you a bit more than is initially natural so the headset can see the controllers better, and also check the lighting/reflections in the room you are in as bright sunlight can overwhelm the sensors in the headset and lead to areas it can’t see to track the handsets accurately, watch out for any updates downloading in the background as those can cause brief inconsistencies in the tracking, and if nothing else, reboot the headset. I’m working my way through finishing all the songs on at least Expert with faster song and ghost blocks and concentrating on getting accurate hits and no misses of course, and these tips mean I very rarely have misses when I know I hit the blocks and so I know any errors are mine and not the tracking. I still get the odd back tracking and you can tell the difference when you miss or it incorrectly thinks you missed, but I can usually fix the issues with one of the tips above and get back to accurate tracking.",2020年11月8日22:04,5,Great

Even during my first attempts on easy mode I already felt like a beautiful dancer - or maybe assassin. A couple of weeks down the line and I'm mostly playing all the levels on Expert and even as a fifty year old woman I feel cool as a cucumber. The satisfaction of beautifully chopping the cubes has to be experienced to be believed. This is truly worth every penny. As a musician, learning the patterns is like practising an instrument. At the start you feel like the higher levels will always be impossible, but then your hands start to learn on their own and your brain gets out of the way and your entire body starts to feel the joy.

Are there any downsides? Only the limited number of songs from a narrow set of genes in the base game. But there's a mod to fix all that for you if you're into going the sidequest route.

Buy this one. It's as good as everyone says it is.",2020年11月10日06:23,5,Exceptional and compelling

I feel like they’ve shot themselves in the foot here as nobody thinks paying per track the Same amount as if you own the song is value. You can’t enjoy it in the car or use it anywhere else.

I always mean to just play a couple songs, but that usually turns into an hour or more of beats. I recently tried a multi player mode with random people, and it was so much fun... even though I lost most rounds cuz I still haven't played a few songs. The only down side I have with this game is that I can't look at mine or my friends high scores from just the app, I need to have my head set on and get into the game. Other than that, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game!!!",2020年11月3日17:48,5,"I LOVE THIS GAME, but..."

Well, Beat Saber is just that! one of a kind experience.
 Is hard to explain to people foreign to video games or let alone VR games.
But once you start swinging your sabers it clicks.
Beat Saber is to VR, as what Tetris was for the Nintendo Gameboy, a game that 
anyone can play, enjoy, and also it happens to be very addictive.",2020年11月4日14:54,5,A must have game experience!

The idea in my head did not seem as exciting as it was, played the demo and immediately found out why people love it so much. The graphics are just outstanding, not to mention, I’m in the demo, there’s better graphics in the full game! The feel of the game and the interaction with the beat of the song gives you this nice feeling that never fails to put a smile on your face. It’s such a wonderful game to play and share with friends! The feeling of rush as these boxes with arrows on them come at you, with your brain telling you how you need to hit them and which way to swing, and when you need to hit them, knowing that if you beat that level you can try the next difficulty... it’s amazing. The game is so well made with such a simple idea, this provides endless fun. It never gets boring, it’s amazing for the Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, and even the Oculus Quest 2 where the graphics get even better. This is a must buy and will overall make your VR experience much more fun and exciting. You need to try this...",2020年11月2日13:18,5,Best Game Ever
2022-05-24 17:38:58.380531,I got beat saber 5 days ago and I thought the songs that where built in are a little bit boring and then i discovered BMBF it’s basically modded beat saber that you can download almost what ever song you want for free!!! That’s the crazy part it’s free so don’t buy the DLC’s download BMBF no it’s not a virus oh and if you are very new don’t straight up download BMBF play the built in songs for a bit get the hang of the game and then download BMBF because there are some difficult songs so I think it’s a must have beat saber is one of the best VR games out there I am not saying that you have to download BMBF it’s just a recommendation from me and from many over people so if you have beat saber think of downloading BMBF,2020年11月2日16:13,5,It’s a must have one

The challenges are fun, though the difficulty curve seems off (still can’t get threw the 25 max combo one) does get you to try all the available modifiers though. Haven’t jumped into multi player yet but once my confidence is higher I look forward to it. 
Would like to see improvements to the casting for when friends are over. Currently lagging badly and I don’t think it’s my setup.  
I’d love to see more music options classic rock, metal, hip hop all should be available.  Still I’m not displeased with what’s there.

It was once designed for many people to enjoy regardless of their preferences and struggles through the modding feature; which allowed you to add any song you loved to the game if Beat Saber didn’t have it. However, in the recent they removed the very modding that encouraged people to buy the game on other vr devices. In the process the update erased all my data and progress in the game.

Now I also got green day and Linkin park and what do I have to find out? They have censored swear words in the music 😡
What is wrong with you?
Having those beeps in the music totally disrupts the playing experience. Each one feels like a punch in the face, when I heard the song so often and then BAM ""we decided that you must not hear this word"".

Although bluetooth connectivity is an experimental feature, I have problems every time I connect my Bluetooth headphones while playing Beat Saber.

2022-05-24 17:40:12.382226,"I don't feel like making an in depth review so I made a pros and cons list. I wasn't going to leave a review but I need to get the word out there that this game is not worth it.

Pros: 

Cons: 

Screen flashes too much

No Volume/ Audio settings (so it's consistently loud all the time)

Terrible Tracking

Poor Customization Options

Overpriced song packs

Poor and unbalanced Multiplayer lobbies

The song selection isn't good

Some songs are harder than others with no rhyme or reason. Expert + on ""Reason for Living"" looks like easy compared to ""What the Cat"" on hard. They aren't anywhere close to similar skill levels.

Here's a list of SIGNIFICANTLY better games you can vet for the same price

Espire 1 (really cool gameplay and long story)

Phantom Covert Ops (Feels like classic CoD Campaign and has incredible mechanics)

Onward (Community is toxic, but realistic weapon mechanics an is still better than 
Beat Saber)

Virtual Virtual Reality (Half the price if this game and has an in depth complex storyline with collectables making the replayability high)

Rec Room (Free and yet the character customization is better than Beat Saber)

Do NOT buy this game. There are better song games out there like ""Pistol Whip"" for example. Don't waste your money like I did. Beat Saber does not improve their game. They only add songs in order to have a payday.",2020年11月19日11:27,2,DON'T PURCHASE THIS GAME!
2022-05-24 17:40:12.462532,"This game is really fun for about the first 10 minutes. Then you start to realize that to play all the songs that you probably bought this game for, you have to spend even more money. You get no songs by real artists, and unless you like techno music, you will be kind of disappointed. Just be cautious before you get mad or disappointed. 
BTW: This game is definitely not worth the hype.",2020年11月29日03:28,2,Fun BUT.....
2022-05-24 17:40:22.820183,"It I could, I would rate this 4.5 stars. Overall Beat Saber is a great game, and is my second favorite VR game. The new multiplayer update is awesome, with many new features and UI changes that make the game better. One change that I don’t like is that you can’t set your speed to 100% anymore in practice mode. One of the most useful part of practice mode was that you could skip ahead in the song to the hard part, but now you can’t at 100% speed. I would give this 5 stars if this wasn’t an issue, and hopefully it will I’ll be changed. Thanks for reading my review :)",2020年11月9日04:32,4,Great game but has a couple minor issues

2022-05-24 17:40:33.505149,"This was the first game I bought after getting my Quest and it's the one game I play the most with friends and family. Especially now that multiplayer (i.e. ""Online"") has been added. 

Highly entertaining and easy to use. A cross between Guitar Hero and Fruit Ninja. 

The strength of this game is also it's weakness: the Content. The levels are hand-crafted to go with the music so both need to be in-sync for the level to work. Sometimes the level design is great but the music is so-so. Sometimes it's the opposite. When they are both excellent the game is highly satisfying and very enjoyable. 

The downside is: you quickly get tired of the playing the same music if you play this game a lot. At launch you will probably like about 60% of the music available. There are several IAP music packs available currently but they target superfans so if you like that specific band....great...if not, you're SOL.

I realize IAP Music Packs are licensed from the bands so they are costly and take time to develop. It would be great to add more original music or to license smaller bands so there is more variety. 

Overall...this is an excellent product and my favorite game for playing in social settings. Definitely worth the money!",2020年11月16日13:37,4,Still one of my favorite games

Ok, before I had this game which was when it was released, it looked awesome but underwhelming of how little songs there are... but on November 2019, when I got this game, I ADORED it! 3 OST’s, 5 extra songs including Freakin’ CRAB RAVE, and a camellia pack which might I just say, EXTREMELY CHALLENGING, and DLC songs! I was SURPRISED and shocked how much fun this game is! If you just got this game and have no experience with rhythm/music based games, I recommend normal. But if you’re looking for a challenge, try hard mode. I’m an expert level person, not to brag, and it’s AMAZING how much care they put into this game! But the problem is this game is dark and I have nyctophobia (fear of the dark) and I kinda get iffy with every update because, they make the darkness more darker and realistic... But it’s still fun! So fun, that I ignore the darkness and have fun! And do NOT get me started with the multiplayer... THE. FUNNEST. THING. EVER. It’s literally everything I’ve dreamed of! What everyone’s been dreaming of! It’s so fun and challenging, multiplayer encourages you to get better at the game and get first place EVERY TIME. Honestly this game has so much to offer! Even without mods! The one suggestion I have is please add a Joji album! That’s all I request! Other than that, 10/10, would play FOREVER if I could!

The expansion is so well thought out it is hard to believe it was not there the whole time.  

The only thing I would change is to allow custom access codes for private games. It is hard to get the random code to someone living in a different state. If players could enter their own code then distant friends could join in seconds knowing your code. If someone figures it out and joins by mistake,  then great.

2022-05-24 17:41:47.114571,so i loved beat saber before the update  and i had said before  to my cousin how i thought it would be so much better if there was multiplayer mode put on  and so then they did this  how great  and i love how they did it   it's great  however it would be much better if at least in the loby you can have voice chatting at least that way  the poeple that are  about to play together  we can at least talk about or compromise on the song being played  also  for creating a server  it would also be great if you could make it so when you create a server  you can lave it open for other's to join you with or with out a passcode  otherwise the only good thing about that create a server is you can atlest open a private place for you and your friends  but it would be great if we could just simply open a server and allow just anyone to join who wishes to   i mean otherwise what is the point of putting a passcode on there  leave it open otherwise leave it open for other's to join if there is not a passcode  please impliment this feature  it would be greatly appreicated  i'm sure there are many who feel the same way   thank you to the devs  who i beleive are doing a great job  just keep listening to us who use your products if you make it how we the customers ask  we will continue to buy into your product other wise  just do like some of these other creaters make a product and then abandon it  it's crappy to do that  espeically if you spent like 24 to 30 bucks on it  please just listen to us who are purchasing your product  thank you,2020年11月16日03:51,4,

2022-05-24 17:41:47.263757,"While yes, it is technically illegal for players to mod their game and use custom songs, the developers at beat saber know that a large community of their players do this. A lot of these players modify their game so that they can play a much wider variety of songs at much more difficulties. Many mods that you can get make the game a lot more fun, too! Also, these players that mod their game compete in tournaments and also regularly make videos which helps beat saber through advertising by more people viewing their gaming. However, with this new update, the developers at beat saber have made it much, much, much, harder to create mods and to play with them, which is making them lose a lot of their dedicated players. And, for those who have modded their beat saber, MULTIPLAYER DOESN’T WORK. Yup, if you have any unofficial modifications or any custom songs, multiplayer will be unable to work. This multiplayer update is huge for the game and it has been highly anticipated but it is now devastating many players who are now unable to play with their friends. Lots of people who are deciding to un-mod their game in order to play multiplayer are very upset that they are only limited to specific songs at lower difficulties, with most songs having to be paid for. While is may only be a minor upset for many players, it has greatly affected the dedicated beat saber community who spend much of their time playing custom songs with many mods. If anyone from the beat saber team is viewing this, and if it is possible, LET MULTIPLAYER WORK. It would make so many players happy and the community of dedicated players would grow very rapidly. On another note, I’d like to say that beat saber is truly a great game and it has created such an amazing level of entertainment for all players at all levels.

So basically i have a music game where the audio sucks because i can't plug it to anything and I'm forced to use the obscene quest 2 earphones.

I plug to pc for better audio and i must pay again. Impossible to do party game nights with friends, no audio, cast has lag.

It's so addictive that I haven't bothered trying anything else apart from Superhot which while fun is not as addictive. Multiplayer is brilliant and adds a nice competitive twist to an already amazing game.

My only problem with multiplayer is the fact that you get kicked out of a lobby game if someone selects a DLC song that you don't own. I was having an awesome time in a lobby with 4 people and suddenly one person shows up, selects a DLC song that no one else owned, and the game started with him being the only person playing it while the rest of us were in standby 🤦. Needless to say I was forced to quit the lobby instead of waiting for 5 mins just staring at one person playing silently. There have been multiple such instances where my gaming session has been ruined due to this. This needs to be corrected. Either don't allow a song to be selected that everyone doesn't own, or at least majority of the people don't own. There is a built-in songs more which I guess restricts it to only base game songs, but I hardly ever find people in that mode since it's not the default option",2020年10月26日11:22,5,Must have and hard to put down

The single player game is fun, but the campaign is a quick play through. The amount of content released since the Oculus hit the market is pathetic. The developer had the opportunity to release all sorts of content during the spring lockdown and failed to deliver more than one music pack. The multiplayer is a cool concept but poorly executed. Half of my multiplayer matches are people voting to play Crystallize who can’t even get through the whole song. And if the majority of the players vote on a DLC song that one player doesn’t have, then the game defaults to an OST song. If you try to host a game, then you better have friends to invite because it won’t match players from quick play to your game.

I was not disappointed. This game is fantastic and is my go-to game when picking up the headset. I would recommend it to anyone. 

The visuals are fantastic. I particularly enjoy the Green Day setting. 

The sound is amazing. So many new artists I've never heard of. The soundtrack is now on my Spotify playlist. However, I would LOVE an ability to add custom songs or even just some more DLC of hip hop and deep house hits. 

I get a decent workout from this game. My arms can ache afterwards and I'm covered in sweat, (yuk) it is exercise without the feeling of exercising. 

I found the Easy level too easy. The Normal level is fun and challenging but anything above Hard I can't do very well. I still enjoy it very much though and I'm still very much a beginner, so will aim to reach a better level as I progress.

That said I'm finding it really addictive and seem to be shedding pounds already. Even like the music though you won't find me playing it while driving around. 🤫
The sabers feel great and love the vibration on contact. Makes me feel like a Sith lord on a day off.
To the developers; knock us old rockers up a few rock packs to download please. Metallica, Judas Priest, Saxon,etc. Anything heavy or rock ballads would be outstanding. 
Worth every penny. 👍🏻",2020年10月20日00:19,5,Old rocker of 56

2022-05-24 17:43:32.665281,"Beat saber is the game that keeps me putting on my headset every day. The drive to improve, to get a better score, to beat that stupid hard challenge map that you’ve been grinding at for days, all those bring the biggest dopamine rush I have ever felt. The base game is fine enough, lasts a good 10-15 hours, but once you go ahead and install custom songs with BMBF a whole world opens up. The sheer amount of custom songs, and the insane difficulty that can be reached, absolutely improves the game. Once you go down the rabbit hole of ranked with ScoreSaber the game just becomes a drug with how much you play every day to get a few more performance points and go up the global leaderboards.

2022-05-24 17:43:53.895689,"I never write reviews so let me start by saying that this game is so good it has made me enjoy video games again. As a larger man who has always found it necessary to stay active in order to stay fit I found modern video games rather lacking in that they promoted more of a sedentary lifestyle. Now that works for many people who don't love to eat as much as I do but with beat Saber you get an extremely immersive and fun gaming experience that if played properly can be one heck of a workout. The Oculus quest and games like this have really excited me for virtual reality and what can be coming in the gaming industry for the future. I Absolutely love love love this game!!! My girlfriend loves to chuckle at me while I'm dancing all around the living room floor playing the 360 degree levels that they added. This game really gets you moving and it's fun and there's continually new challenges and ways to one up yourself. The customization allowing you to change the rules in the environment and the colors of your sabers and many other aspects of the game make the game have so much replay value it's ridiculous. Also all they have to do is release another music pack and they've got another $15 from me that I happily give them. the ability to take videos of me playing and uploading them has actually given me opportunities to show other people what playing on one of these sets is like and in turn three of my coworkers have already purchased occulus quests as well. I'm definitely giving it 5 stars for this reason but with that said here's some things that I truly feel would make a great thing even better.
1: Include a multiplayer mode where you can play with friends online. 
2: More music, I mean let’s be candid, I know you've got to make money and that's what selling these headsets and software is about so pump 'em out and charge away, I’m buying.

And now I'm addicted. I love it. The natural feeling of the swords, the amazing music, the actual feel as you cut the blocks.

I tried it, and it is GREAT. If you're on the fence about this game, just get it already! It's gameplay is fun and addicting, and it gets BRUTALLY difficult when you step up the difficulties.

I have had the game for over a year, and I am still loving as much as I did back then. With the amount of music packs available, and the abilities such as mods, colours of the sabers/blocks and multiple environments to choose from makes the game even better with the amount of customization options available.

The multiplayer mode has also recently came out, in which you play amongst four other players to complete the song chosen. The atmosphere is great with this mode, and makes the games 10x more enjoyable.

In order to play custom songs, you have to download a beat saber song library from online and because I don’t have a PC, this is just not possible. Something that should definitely be added is an official custom song library where people can use whatever music/audio they want to make beat saber songs for the community.

I had it on normal and set the speed to 175 and was still getting A's but i just couldn't figure out why i couldn't make it through hard mode. Then i figured it out in multiplayer mode. In the settings to the left of you while in the lobby count down if you set the note distance to FAR and then also disable the debris effect it works so much better for me. I think its cool that those settings are there and you can still get the same quality workout all around on hard. I just need to find these settings in solo mode now and also figure out how to adjust my height. The height of the avatar float is there to adjust but i cant move it any higher than its default setting. Im guessing at just a little higher you can maybe see what's behind the notes a little better as well. Im glad i found this out because on default settings i was ready to get a refund and just eat the green day tracks i purchased. Solid work.

The beginning of each song feels like you are in the movie Tron which is just awesome, and competing with others makes you continually strive to improve. I don’t know, I just seem to be better at this game when playing multiplayer, and this is a game that the better you get at it multiplies your enjoyment. Also the multiplayer pushes me to try maps I hadn’t really thought to spend much time in previously and find a new appreciation for them. Great work guys.",2020年10月19日07:43,5,Loving the Multiplayer
2022-05-24 17:46:42.544493,"I can’t actually believe I’m about to say this but... the multiplayer mode that’s been added to beatsaber recently has ABSOLUTELY transformed the entire game for me and I’m actually starting to like it a lot!!! 😲 I’ve been playing VR games for around 3 years or so now and I was never ever a huge fan of beatsaber in that entire time and always found it hard to wonder what the appeal was. Don’t get me wrong I thought it was ok as one of those games to go into for around 10-15 mins (even with custom songs) but I ended up getting bored super quickly even on the higher difficulty modes. But this.. this beautiful creation where you can compete against others live on all the songs, all the various difficulties, seeing whos ahead during a song or even spectating others. its an absolute GAME CHANGER and it’s EXACTLY what this title needed to pull people like me in. Never ever thought I’d say I love beatsaber and I never ever thought I’d write a review on this but I now do and I now have! 

My summary: A 3-4 star game at best without the multiplayer aspect as it can get old quickly but now with multiplayer at your disposal this is a 5 star title all day long! Really well done to the devs!!!",2020年10月19日08:07,5,Multiplayer is THE GAME CHANGER!
2022-05-24 17:46:42.632262,"Beat Saber is a game that everybody should play at least play once in your lifetime. This is one of the games I show people just getting into VR especially if they like music. 

With the fantastic multiplayer added and all the different music added including music from one of my favorite games of all time Rocket League I can't not buy this game. 

You can have fun on the easy or normal difficulties and all you have to do is swing so, it just makes it easy for new people to pick it up and get use to playing. On expert+ it's the hardest game I've played in my life but still beatable. 

Though Audica is my favorite rhythm game Beat Saber is a must own game in your library.",2020年10月19日02:03,5,"""Thee Rhythm Game"""
2022-05-24 17:46:42.720721,"I adore this game, it’s fun, addictive but not too bad, it challenges you and makes you want to improve your skills. But, it’s $35 CAD, and you have to pay to unlock more songs. Which is  absolutely ridiculous, also I see the “custom level” request a lot in the reviews and I agree, we need the versatility that the other platforms have, because as it stands the music can feel samey and after a while you are left wanting more, but to get more there is a $10 CAD price tag. Please fix this issue devs, please don’t make us pay more ontop of the already pretty high price tag. 

EDIT: So I forgot I thought of something, maybe instead of an entire custom level editor you guys could take ~5 most played custom levels from the pc version and then from there add the next most played song from pc a week. Just an idea but could make the game a bit more worth the price tag.

TL;DR: Lacks variety and has expensive micro transactions even though it’s an expensive game already

Another Edit
Alright like 3-4 months later, I still play this game fairly often, but only for the BMBF community, the new multiplayer update is cool but doesn’t work with mods installed, it’s a fair trade off at first glance. But when PC users are both encouraged to mod the game and still get to enjoy the full game it just makes it really hard to enjoy the game to its fullest. One of the huge reasons BMBF is so cool is because the base game mapping gets really dull at around expert-expert+, a lot of the notes just seem to be repetitive up and downs, BMBF modding fixes this because there are so many different people mapping the songs so there’s always variety.

I just hope we can see a bit more mod support in the future, but for now it seems like it’s going to be the opposite because when starting up a modded version of the game you get a warning.

People fixed your game for you, at least give us the courtesy to enjoy it.",2020年10月24日03:04,3,Almost a definite buy

I wish they had put more effort into the campaign mode though. Usually the campaign mode in a rhythm game introduces you to all the content at increasing levels of difficulty so you have a natural progression from easy to expert or whatever. 

Some of the modifiers you encounter are great, others are hard to believe the made it off of paper and into the game. I don't mind failing for missing too many notes or making too many bad cuts. But failing because my combo got too high? Or I didn't miss enough notes? Because I didn't cover 800m while playing the song? Those mechanics just aren't fun.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a VR headset",2020年10月17日02:59,5,Best VR game you can get!

Once you get some songs you like, and crank up the difficulty, you might be lucky enough to enter a 'flow' and lose yourself in the game and the music.

Slight disclaimer, do not flow when people have camera phones around you. You will regret the video evidence of this moment, especially once it's posted online.",2020年10月21日03:50,5,Flow

The campaign is challenging.
They now have online verses mode.
I experienced no motion sickness.

This being said I'm a huge guitar hero fan and maybe I wish it had a more competitive game play.",2020年10月15日12:45,5,The only game I continue to play.

It could just be that my oculus is lagging or there are hackers. But besides the point it is a amazing game.

PROS: customizable for beginners all the way to experts. You can make it extremely hard or extremely easy. Multiplayer is a plus. The ability to buy new songs to keep it interesting.
CONS: if saber is in a low position When swiping from the bottom to the top on a cube the game does not always “read” your saber and it will count that as a miss. This happens more with my right saber than my left and it can be very frustrating and distracting. When using multiplayer I have had instances where I am not able to hear the other players. Between every song you have to stop and pick a new song and start that song. I wish they would have an option for continuous play.￼",2020年11月2日00:06,4,"The good, the bad"

But with Online, we can build some really fun buds of relationships even without words, from the camraderie of just dancing together. There are a few I would have loved to friend request. If there's a way to search in my history for those ive played with (since things happen like disconnects etc) that would be awesome.

The other issue i have is that beatsaber is not easily streamable. I want to livestream, at the very least on Facebook. This isn't just a *fun* thing but also helps everyone in marketing from the game itself to the Oculus Quest headset to VR in general.

I don’t know how licensing for songs works but I noticed you have Linkin Park, Green Day, and a bunch of tech music. Could you guys(developers) pass on this game to your black team now? Make it sound like black people made it. Maybe you have a contractor who can do that for you? Please more variety in music.   I am white myself and Alt rock is my music.

2. Theme packs are great. But in multiplayer the design of the stage is different. Thats a shame.

3. I love 360 mode. A great workout. But I cant compete in multiplayer in 360 mode. 

4. You sound be able to send a friend invite to a game instead of have to text them a code.

2022-05-24 17:49:10.262746,"Ok, at first it is exciting, and seems like a good workout. However, I soon discovered that I only have to move my head to avoid obstacles. Even true for the fitness soundtrack (left right, etc.). Hardly do I have to bend down to avoid obstacles (developers please add them!). Mainly good for hand eye coordination training. Workout level equivalent to walking once you understand the tricks!! And yes, I do expert levels too! The 90 and 360 mode tries to improve this, but there are very few songs that have this option and with limited difficulty levels!
They could have made more use of room space. Just allowing one meter to move left or right and many more low flying obstacles would make it much better. Or are they afraid that players may get hurt by moving around? I want to train my leg muscles also! Why not introduce obstacles to avoid by going down with your face on the ground? So far only up to hip level and very few cases! Increasing difficulty level mainly limited to an increase in blocks per second leading to faster wrist movenents mainly.

Music? Well all the same stuff (not something I would normally listen to). They could have added more variation, or do they expect you to buy music packs?

The demo level was great because I could compete with friend who used my Quest and their names would appear on the score list, not possible with the paid version (everyone needs to have their own Quest+game). So we use pen and paper for that...

If developers would address these points it would easily be a five point score.",2020年11月3日00:05,2,Not enough options for a good workout

2022-05-24 17:49:41.903671,"LONG STORY SHORT:
Post update
Missing sounds, inconsistent blocks height, super low menu, cut block's halfs fly right into your eyes, bad auto height measurement, inactive manual height measurement (DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE), safety net always pop up unlike pre update.
People who use Oculus Quest ONE talk about the same thing on Reddit . 

Long story:
It all was fun and smooth until I decided to update. 
Is it meant for giant midgets? 
All of the Menu became SUPER low. Meanwhile regular maps give me higher blocks. Maps, I got used to, feel super uncomfortable now. Fixing height doesn't help, because IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE. FIX IT. Auto height makes blocks too high for me. And then again, I cannot manually put my height anymore. Almost every time the sound for the very first cut blocks Does NOT appear. (Angel Voices keeps constantly missing the sound in the beginning). Very Unpleasant. Blocks being inconsistent. Too low or too high blocks in maps/songs that used to be very comfortable to play. The warning net is always there. I KNOW I HAVE A SMALL ROOM, LET ME PLAY. It was not popping up so much before, now it's constantly there, I had to make a way bigger play area, where I have a furniture just so I would not have to deal with that net right in from of my eyes. Also, I used to cut blocks and the particles were falling aside, now they always fall into my eyes. WHY?? ? WHY YOU HAD TO RUIN THE ONLY GAME I GOT OCULUS FOR. I got it just for this game. And now it's HANDICAPPED.",2020年11月2日06:34,2,HORRIBLE UPDATE. Oculus Quest 1.

Hence the 3 star review to something that could have been a 5 star product if the developer wasn't being greedy.

The online is a great new addition and a good opportunity to try some of the maps you aren't used to. They are excellent and a lot are more challenging than you'd think. My only issue with the online and the reason this is four stars and not five is that the game joining tool should be fixed. There should be more options than just all mappings or standard mappings so that you can tick the packs you actually have. There also needs to be some sort of fix on game state that you join, otherwise the first ten minutes of trying to play is spent either trying to find a lobby that hasn't already started or trying to find one with a map you can actually play. Genuinely have searched for a game on putting on my headset and for the first 15 searches its either been midway through or a map I don't have, these arent great odds. When you do find a game its brilliant though!!",2020年10月26日02:27,4,Generally good

2022-05-24 17:53:02.703489,The game is only 5 albums and thats not including the dlc. If you want to get more songs you either have to buy the album pack or go extremely out of the way to install a mod for it. I want to warn people if Campaign is all you want to do then this is the right buy. Otherwise just wait for the next update. Devs you should try and add a dlc that allows for people to play custom maps and that could bring people more to play and you could still gain money from selling a dlc or you could add it as a nice addition to the game.,2021年1月30日17:39,3,READ BEFORE PURCHASING

2022-05-24 17:53:23.580964,"Beat Saber was one of the few games on my list of games to get when I bought the Quest 2. Superhot VR, Onward, and Tetris Effect are also on that list. As a then-PSVR player of Beat Saber, I'm actually impressed with Beat Games for making such an addictingly good game.

As others mentioned, I highly recommend getting BMBF to make the experience better. As it gives you more songs to choose from, and it allows you to get more for your money, but even without BMBF, I'm saying this right now, this game is probably a must-have for Quest owners.

The only real complaint I have with Beat Saber, is the updated menu. I personally don't the main menu. Every other thing about the UI is fine when talking about modes.

Apart from that, however, even with the updated main menu, I personally recommend Beat Saber.",2020年10月21日03:06,4,An Impressive Game

Well more fall me as every game I bought on the PC Oculus Store was there on my Quest 2 but Beat Sabre that wanted me to pay for it again, and to ad salt to the wound every game I buy on Quest 2 unlocks on PC too but this game.  Still was able to play my PC Oculus vision with my friend on Oculus Quest 1 so with no where to go just waited till game came on sale and now I have and can review.  While waiting had a friend with a Rift join us, only he did not.  He had bought game on Steam and despite me running same game on PC just though Oculus store he could not join my game, as he bought on same platform but different device.  One day I might get on Steam too as they have crazy sales so can play with friends their too, but making you pay three times just seems needlessly greedie.  I say needless as I would rate this game 5 star, love it and buy all the packs which at their price would be way more than three copies of this game when bough on sales.  But when I know there is no chance in hell they will unlock packs you bought on the many copy’s they make you buy if you want to play with friends no way.  Also why have 8 player mode.  I might have 8 friends who I will play this with for sure, chance they all have bought on the same store on PC I would rate as zero.

Evidently they are saved on the device and there’s no automatic way to back up. There are Sideloading instructions for back up that may or may not work but it’s a complicated and uncertain way to do something that ought to be automatic and easy. I mean, come on, I can back up my phone with a swipe of my finger!  It’s not just Beat Saber, btw, it’s many if not most games.

Multiplayer is fun. only one thing tho, i wish you could add friends from the multiplayer lobby and wish there was voice chat or sum, of course you can block and report ppl if creators of beat saber add voice chat.

Also another thing, i dont think its fair to not let someone play a song they dont own when other ppl do have it and starts playing, you should add a note that says"" (username) does not own this song, please choose another song"" but they can still play it it just tells them we dont have a song and can choose another song

2022-05-24 18:55:16.268379,"The new multiplayer is great, however if you did mod beat saber to have custom songs then you will be disappointed. I don't mind that. 

Don't write a bad review just because your mods died. The quest is a console, not a PC. Expect there to be future problems if you mod a constantly updated game. (You dum dums)

I've had beat saber on both PC and quest for a long time now. It's a good game. Is it perfect? no. 

The list of songs it has without DLC is definitely lacking a bit. that's probably because most of the songs are actually made by one (or more) of the developers, and it takes a bit to make a good music. 
It also requires money to license music to be in your game. I don't know how much but I'm assuming a lot. 

As someone who is somewhat knowledgeable in the game development space, I have nothing but respect for the devs. 
Does that make me biased? I don't know.
What I do know is that I've been having fun with the game for about 2 years now, with some mods on PC, and no mods on quest. ( I haven't played PC beat saber for several months now, so Take that as you will) 

It's good, and multiplayer made it better.

Don't expect mods to work well.

2022-05-24 18:57:55.243240,I love this game and the music m. I have so much fun playing with my brother and my friends.But I would love The Weekend as a music pack. Would be nice and would defiantly make me want to play more.,2020年10月16日23:37,5,Love this game but needs song
2022-05-24 18:57:55.324537,While most companies are taking advantage of the extra power from the Oculus quest 2. Beat saber has done just the opposite. They dumbed down the graphics by removing textures that completely ruins the immersion. I really hope they change this in a future update otherwise don't waste your money on this one it's become almost unplayable.,2020年10月16日22:24,2,This used to be a great game.
2022-05-24 18:57:55.410220,Any reason why beat saber full installation shouldn't work on a brand new oculus quest 2 headset? Can't get past the user agreement.,2020年10月26日19:43,1,Can't get past the user agreement

2022-05-24 18:58:05.716169,Slicing blocks is more fun then you might think! It’s Defently worth 30$. Fair warning tho. Most of the songs are Edmish and if you don’t like them then you’ll have to buy other music packs. But I love Edm so it’s no problem,2021年1月13日09:53,5,It’s very fun

The game isn't worth 30 dollars at all, Maybe 15 at most. Because you buy this for the game and it's mods, Not the built in songs.",2020年10月9日06:00,4,Great. But not worth 30 dollars.

Seeing how fun the game was on a flat screen is so low compared to actually experiencing the game in VR. Even side loading BMBF onto my Quest literally opened a new door to the rest of the Beat Saber world. I was able to download custom songs and sabers, which if you didn’t know are by far the best this game has to offer. Still, whether you choose just to use the game as is, or side load custom stuff onto Beat Saber, you will surely enjoy what VR has to offer in Beat Saber.",2020年8月5日03:38,5,VR’s Best and Brightest

So one day, a friend brings his Oculus to our, and my family played on it, and when I played, I loved it!! I can’t put it into words on how epic it makes you feel!
A few weeks later, I got my own VR headset literally just to play this game because it was so amazing!

2022-05-24 18:59:30.858611,"Skimming through YouTube one day, I came across a video for a game that had light sabre’s, floating cubes and great music. Jump forward to actually getting my Quest and this was the first game I bought and wasn’t disappointed! The concept couldn’t be simpler - slice the flying boxes, with the matching coloured light Saber in the direction of the arrow, how hard can it be, asks every friend that’s had a go - easy to pick up, hard to master, fun to play and watch! And I’m pretty sure a certain Sith Lord had a hand in some of the campaign levels 😂.

In a nutshell, buy it, you won’t regret it!",2020年9月23日07:39,5,A great way to introduce friends to VR!

2022-05-24 19:00:56.048552,"This game is why I bought my quest and even with my high expectations it’s never disappointed. Just try it and you won’t be disappointed. Not only does it have so many great songs included, but it’s still getting new dlc songs over a year after it’s initial release. Compared to games that I grew up with, DDR and guitar hero, it perfectly encapsulates what a Rhythm game should it gets you to experience songs you may never have before and keeps your interest. Even now after a while of playing I still continue to escape reality and lose track of time.

2022-05-24 19:00:56.316817,Beat Sabre is a fantastic game/work out.  You can maximize with big swings or do smaller motions which is great when in a small place.  I like the ability to side load without too much hassle.  The song selection is great.  The EDM does get your heart rate up there. The various ways to play (stationary 90 360) are fabulous.  Not a lot of glitching on this game and you don’t need internet to play!  Gives me a whole lot more respect for the drummers !!!!!,2020年9月15日23:07,5,"Love, Love, Love Beat Sabre"
2022-05-24 19:01:06.558262,Super fun game but it has such a small portion of songs and doesn't have the infinite playlist like the OG. I'll prolly mod it like everyone's told me,2020年10月15日14:11,5,Totes Yeet Yo

It is definitely one of the essential games everyone needs to buy when they get an oculus quest. The only problem I run into with the game is the occasional non tracking of the touch grips. This is very rarely an issue, however, when my batteries are low and if there isn’t enough light, the tracking can take a break from being perfect. I’d love to see more custom music support on the quest version, the way you get custom songs isn’t for the average user. I love it though!",2020年9月15日08:54,5,Great game!

With modding, you can get mods and custom songs! It makes the game 10x better. To mod, you will need to have a computer and a cable to connect the Quest to your PC.

2022-05-24 19:03:46.883230,When you look back at systems from the past there are always killer games that you remember... Beat Sabre will be one of those games on the Quest! Awesome game to pick up anytime and test your co-ordination and timing! One of those must have games and to show other people all about VR.

2022-05-24 19:04:08.878909,"I know this is long but trust me it’s all worth reading especially if you’re new.

I spent some time looking at the different reviews on here and the majority of complaints were about not having a variety of songs, if you’re thinking about getting this game then I can help you out with that all you need to do is download BMBF if you google it you’ll find dozens of videos on how to install it on your headset but a forewarning you will need a computer to download the software just once as well as a USB-C cable not your headset charger (any Mac or apple laptop charger will suffice as well) once you have these download side quest where you can find hundreds of side loadable games and apps and use that Dow download BMBF which will let you get custom songs without needing to plug your headset in again.

I would also recommend not immediately purchasing all the DLC maybe one or two packs but a surprisingly high amount of the songs can be found on BMBF.

If you’re looking to play the game for fitness purposes then also download YUR: fitness tracker from Sidequest on your computer, I did recently and it’s quite fun to fill up your daily progress meter while hacking and slashing at various colorful blocks.

Finally, (yeah I’m surprised I wrote this much too) if you’re still on the edge about this game in my opinion it is worth every cent I have had tons of fun with my cousins competing for the highest score or racing to get a full combo first and even by yourself it’s a fun physical challenge you can enjoy while rocking out to your favorite songs if you aren’t a fan of high speed games or have difficulty moving the lower levels are fairly easy and simple but still provide fun for those who can’t quite finish the Expert/Expert+ levels. I’ve had hours of fun with what is probably the premiere game of VR right now and never before have I enjoyed a rhythm game as much as this, Beatsaber lets me challenge myself physically and mentally and gauge my own personal growth while allowing me to enjoy one of the best experience of VR; I hope you enjoy it as well.",2020年6月25日06:30,5,Notes on beatsaber

It’s great the game has a wide variety of songs to play and there are custom songs it can be a bit of trouble to get them on quest but the game is amazing the levels are all different. One problem is that the difficulty scalding can be very annoying I tried a songs hard mode and did the song first try and then I switch to expert and was shocked by how difficult it was but with practice it can be very fun.,2020年9月23日12:39,4,My Opinion on beat saber

I only actually play 3 songs because the other ones sound like a dj putting together a bunch of sounds together. I know there are add ons but they cost a lot. My only critic is some of the songs don’t sound like songs. Also maybe add more pop songs and not dubstep. Still gets 5 stars though. No doubt about it!,2020年12月14日01:28,5,It’s great game. Really!

2022-05-24 19:06:29.061727,"It feels a little mean of me to rate one of my favorite apps down a star because of this, but I thought the developers would be more likely to read my review if I rated 4 stars. The glitch is that, after playing the game for a long time (more than 30 min), the left saber begins to flicker and glitch and no longer follows my hand movement. There’s not a problem with the left hand controller in other games or in beat saber when I play for a short time only.

I like the song library and the graphics. My favorite thing about it is the vibrating feeling you get when you put the two sabers together :). I get the feeling that this is a game Jedi would play in their free time in the Star Wars universe, which is pretty cool. 

Oh there’s one other thing I don’t like: the best songs don’t come with the base game and have to be purchased separately. Also, the difficulty of the add-on song packs is much higher than the difficulty of the base game songs, which could be good or bad depending on how good you are (:",2020年8月5日14:45,4,"Great game, one glitch"

2022-05-24 19:06:50.650265,"I love this game! I watched countless videos and bought my Quest solely for this title but there's some issues I have; it doesn't have a search option.

I'm unable to search community songs or download custom songs on the Quest which I wasn't aware of. The only songs I'm able to play are the ones that come free or I have to buy the packs. This isn't an issue since the packs aren't that expensive but I was more interested in playing custom songs/maps from other users online.

The only way to do this is to connect it to the PC then install some programs while also downloading the songs to the headset manually which will also erase my scores/data. It's a lot that I am unfamiliar with and I don't want to mess with that in case I ruin my Quest.

Would have given 5 stars but because of this I have to give 4.",2020年9月22日06:53,4,I love this game but there's some issues

2022-05-24 19:07:01.409197,"Look! I'll say it now and I'll only say it once, I was really skeptical and thought I'd never get this game. I'd watched videos, read articles, and skimmed over HUNDREDS of reviews. But words and videos will bot and can not describe how amazing this game is. Even on the demo alone, after one play through the level, I was immediately sucked in and wanted more. Every time you hit a block the controllers vibrate a bit, sending a pulse of chemical happiness through my brain. Hitting every single block is like a little dopamine button. I have not ONCE got tired of this game! And heck, if you get tired of the OST levels there are always DLC! If you're lucky enough to have a computer, too, you can also install custom beatmaps with only a few clicks! The game hardly crashes, has amazing graphics, NO glitches, and for a concept so simple has granted me many hours of gameplay and many hours to come. This was the second game I ever got on my quest and lemme tell ya, it was WORTH IT! If you haven't played beatsaber, you are NOT using your headset to its full potential. Oh, and did I mention the workout it gives you? Since I started playing, I've lost 5 pounds and been able to curl 25lbs in each hand.

2022-05-24 19:07:22.708908,"Hello Oculus Community! Beat Saber is so popular, so fun, and so worth it! You can play campaign mode, solo mode, or even tournament mode. Though $30.00 seems like a lot for a game, it is awesome! I also suggest buying maybe a cheap music pack like Imagine Dragons or Panic at The Disco. Kids, teens, adults, and seniors I guarantee will love this game! The one thing I slightly dislike is that you can’t play it live multiplayer. It would be so cool if you could play WITH someone, together, next to each other, at the same time. Anyways, those who buy will enjoy! As my father says, “Enjoy your Oculusing,” everyone!

I wish there was more musical content at the start, especially for the price you pay, without having to buy add-ons. That is my only gripe! Otherwise, still a great game!

2022-05-24 19:07:55.000981,If your new to this game it can frustrating at first but don’t 1 star it once you get to expert and above it becomes fun. It has one minor issue sometimes Sword does not cut but it happens in 1 every 300 blocks but this is minor (Only On Oculus Quest 2 that I know of) but I’ve had did game for one year and I’m on expert it just takes patience to get good. Very good game with some issues sometimes.,2020年12月27日11:58,4,Very Honest Review

2022-05-24 19:07:55.191437,I was hesitant at first because the game looks remarkably simple and I didn’t think it would be able to hold my attention for long. I WAS SOOOO WRONG. It’s super fun especially if you download your own custom songs (since the ost’s aren’t the great but music is subjective so take this with a grain of salt). I see now why beat saber is considered a rite of passage for VR.,2020年9月2日05:03,5,"Don’t think, just buy"

2022-05-24 19:09:09.954679,"So it’s fun but the songs you get with it nobody knows and the additional packs are  insanely priced. For £22.99 I expect some songs I know and not just random things. It’s so expensive to get the packs you want and you’ll spend hundreds if your stupid enough 

Like I say while it is fun it’s a total rip off for what you get with it with no way of seeing that before you pull the trigger and purchase it

Totally focused on forcing you to buy packs instead of focusing on the game play and enjoyment

Yet another micro transaction cash cow

2022-05-24 19:09:20.651337,This is an incredibly fun and addicting games it’s one of those things that is easy to start but takes a long time to master.

2022-05-24 19:09:20.754063,The game is great but all the expansion packs are over priced and most are poorly made. I can beat all the main songs with an S ranking on hard but most of the expansions are just off beat and are not fun to play.,2020年10月4日05:41,4,Over priced packs
2022-05-24 19:09:30.981444,Their choices for songs are lousy. Including all of the packs there are maybe two songs I care for. No custom songs without third party intervention. No crossbuy so you can't use the Rift version and it has (or had the last time I looked) the ability to load custom songs and maps. A good product brought low by poor management choices.,2020年8月3日22:40,1,Great but limited selection of songs

Other than that no complaints! The game is as every bit as awesome as people say it is.",2020年9月12日02:57,5,Great! Needs easier access to custom map
2022-05-24 19:10:02.977486,"We enjoy this game so much, and we've recently started using it as ""recess"" time from online school and have launched a Family Beat Saber Challenge. It's a fun reward for staying focused on schoolwork.",2020年9月18日06:45,5,Family fun!
2022-05-24 19:10:03.074259,I love this game so much but i wish we didnt have to pay for songs and get them for freee because Beatsaber on pc has a song download system if yall could add that it would be even better i play this game so much and its so fun overall a great game but add the download song system and itll be even better :D,2020年8月28日23:56,5,This Game is Great.
2022-05-24 19:10:03.163022,"I love the game, it brings a fresh nostalgia from the guitar hero days. But I don't see much diversity in the music. I bought it thinking that Timberland would bring something from the community but he failed. While his tracks were decent it lacked the cultural balance in which I can relate. Basically I'm asking for some rap/hip hop music options here. All in all it is a must have title for the Quest. 

Just lacks diverse genres. Guitar Hero didn't exclude anyone, maybe jazz but that's understandable.",2020年8月28日15:55,5,Legendary but...
2022-05-24 19:10:03.258761,"Beat Saber is one of the best VR games- no, the best game I have ever played. The game offers something easy at first, but as you progress, you can play songs that make your arms hurt. There is basically no skill ceiling and you can always get better. Custom songs make this game have basically infinite replayability.

TL;DR: good game",2020年8月29日06:01,5,One of the best games ever
2022-05-24 19:10:03.356473,This is the most fun game I have ever played. A lot of games that you get for like an Xbox are like 60 bucks. That’s half the price. It’s so fun and you can buy extra music packs like Imagine Dragons that I love to play all the time specially on hard mode because it’s pretty easy. And the graphics are amazing.,2020年8月29日09:43,5,Best game ever

2022-05-24 19:10:13.735928,I LOVE THIS GAAAMMMMEEEEE,2020年10月23日09:04,5,Really good game needs Coldplay pack tho
2022-05-24 19:10:13.853613,"It's a simple concept really, but highly enjoyable to play and addictive #musclememmory. It has good game mechanics, builds up your reflexes, memory and cardio and has some truly gamer oriented higher difficulty settings - the trick is to rewire your visual cortex straight into your motor cortex: 0 ping, no lag.
It's even a perfect VR experience if you are willing to buy the beter music packs.

'Cause my only complaint is the music that's with the base game, that's not a part I look forward to when I load into beat saber. It's probably the reason I don't play the game more, to be frank.
I know music tastes vary, but still, it's pretty poor borderline annoying at times.

This way, beat saber does rack up a high pick up price, with vanilla + some real songs. 

But the truth is, it's probably still worth it. 
There are days BeatSaber simply puts a smile on my face. (Yes, let's!)

Hopefully, future generation beat saberers will get some of the current DLC as FLC, as more DLC comes out. Now then... it will be a no brainer, must buy.

Now it's just highly recommended, for the energetic gamers amongst you - it's not just Zoom that needs your speed...",2020年9月2日06:35,5,"Great, but gets expensive with DLC"
2022-05-24 19:10:13.956338,"I love the game but one suggestion is that maybe you could put like 2-4 sabers it could even be paid for but I think that more savers would really spice up the game. And I know that you can get custom sabers from mods but the average beat saber play will most likely not want/ know how to install those, nothing game changing just a fun idea anyway it’s a very fun game and a must have for the quest",2020年8月29日22:50,5,Amazing game but one suggestion

3. I've had the game lag so much, this is the only game I've had lag and it ends up with me failing cause of it

4. This isn't a bug complaint, but you have such little levels that this game won't give you much fun out of it, they need to have the custom song feature without a PC

I have played endless hours of this game and still don’t get bored. The only time I stop playing is either when I have to or I get sore from playing for hours. If you start getting bored there is a whole world of difference that you can get through mods. I have nearly 500 more songs and have had fun and will continue having fun climbing ranks.

Quest needs official support for custom songs, which in my opinion will not harm revenue from music packs (I have bought 3 and they are all *exceptional* and worth buying). Conversely, without a map community, players can and absolutely *will* burn out on the included songs.

Not docking a star-- there exists nothing better, and even with built-in songs only, months off replayability. But custom songs/map support would escalate this to a level it still hasn't reached.",2020年8月26日04:13,5,Long-term must-play

I actually played a bit too hard the 1st two days and pulled a muscle in my arm. Was only about 30 min sessions. 3rd day I rested but was itching to pick up beat saber again.

I'm on the 4th day today and I played for longer than 2 hours straight! Still no nausea and actually had to stop cuz I didn't plug it in (for more freedom in moving) and the battery ran out.

Overall, the more I played, the more immersive and addicting this game became! The music is very good and great in the VR environment and  conducive to movement making for great exercise without even feeling like you're exercising.

Just playing a few days and getting the hang of it pretty easily. Playing most of the songs on hard already makes me feel like a reflex master. There's a reason it's one of or is the most well-known VR games out there.",2020年8月25日10:24,5,Addicting

AND they added a setting for the location of the sabers (which is a fricken life saver, vive wand users, go to settings -> controller and set your Y position to -1.0 it’ll feel almost like the vive. even if u never used the vive wands before, try the setting above **Actually saw a youtube video this guy had his setting at X Rotation 40, try that if the Y position didn’t help. **Actually saw a few more settings lol. just try em all and see what looks and feels right to you. **LAST edit** lol okay so i played around with all the settings and now for sure, its best at was the first one i mentioned. that one for sure feels the most like the wand. a very minor tweak in the settings. 

heard beatsaber team is making multiplayer!! which i hope have random cube generator and the longer the combo the more cubes generate for the opposing player or something like that and if both complete the song another random harder song is played until one player’s loses all health bar. that might be kinda cool.",2020年8月23日05:15,5,honestly ..

I'd say beat saber is like the Mario Brothers of VR, an instant classic that everyone loves! If you're on the fence for buying this game, look no further, as soon as you buy this, you won't be able to stop! Here's why: The game mechanics are simple, slice the cubes with the correct lightsaber color and direction in time with the music, but it's a nice challenge to master, figuring out how notes flow, and what tricks work best. The music in my opinion sounds great, i couldn't imagine any other type of music for this game, but if you don't like it, please don't let your opinion ruin this game's reviews because of your opinion. (There's ways to mod it anyway if you don't like the music but still respect the developers' time and effort into this wonderful game) The only problem I'd ever have with this game is that it can be tiring after a few hours of playing, but it's a good workout and it's so fun while doing it! i would rate this in my top games of all time, even off of VR.

Most of the songs are catchy and make you want to dance. Yes, it can be glitchy at times, which I noticed happens more when the battery is low with the headset or one of the remotes. It doesn't happen enough to make me want to quit. It is enjoyable to play, and the next thing you know, it has turned into an awesome workout you've been doing for 45 minutes. I also love that there's an option to change colors of the light sabers (mine are purple and blue now 🙃) and all the other game playing options.

You work through the songs fast though and here comes the big ""but"". The music packs are essential for the longevity of the game and their quality vary a lot.

Anyway, what I want to say to the developers is that you really need to give a big fat giant wallop of a raise to whoever made the maps for the new Linkin Park pack!!!!! Also, please give that person the ability to build all future maps. I say this because, while beat saber rules the quest, for the most part the maps become pretty predictable once you've played a lot of songs. These new Linkin Park maps are STUPID FUN!!!! They're even fun in normal mode and usually I don't play normal mode because it's boring to me. So, yeah, more of this arm waving, dancing, creative awesomeness that has me playing for so long that I have trouble lifting my arms because I wouldn't stop because it's just too fun. Please and thank you!!! Seriously, please tell the creator of the Linkin Park maps thank you for me. 😁",2020年8月19日23:35,5,To the developers (please read. Thanks!)
2022-05-24 19:15:37.105545,"So far this game is great!  I enjoy the play style, and the music. Then last night I took turns playing it with my son competition style and it totally changed how I view this game.  We had a blast going back and forth to see who could get the high score or the fewest misses.  Unfortunately once we move to a new song there’s no way to know who had the high score unless you write it down or just remember them all.  I think Beat Saber may be missing an opportunity to have an arcade style setup where you can enter your initials for your score.  Otherwise an awesome game that provides some working out, def recommend!",2020年8月23日22:18,5,Arcade style

Go for it, it's worth every dime. The grungy underground tunnel serving as the backdrop is a far cry from the techno lights we've had so far - for the better. Edgy new look and feel.

2022-05-24 19:16:30.412935,"I want to preface this by saying that this game is phenomenal and I recommend this to anyone who has a quest. But it could be better. For one, there’s this really annoying glitch where your saber goes through the block and you miss because of a glitch. But the bigger problem is the fact that you can not have custom songs. It is possible, we know this because of BMBF, but they chose not to include it because... why? It makes no sense at all, but I think it’s because they want to sell more DLC music packs. If you’re really in it for the money, then make custom songs DLC. It would be better if you just make custom songs a free update, but that’s not gonna happen. At least not with Facebook controlling this thing.",2020年9月4日23:00,4,"So Close, yet so far."

That’s so cool and there are levels you can buy that have very popular songs. Also the game updates all the time adding new songs for free and songs you can buy.

Modding the game to allow custom tracks is a bit of a pain but it opens up a world of quality content and brings the game up to 5 stars. I'd probably rate the unmodded game 3 stars due to its limited track selection, most of which is just electro music.

With custom tracks the game is easily 5 stars. I play it daily and find it an enjoyable light workout.",2020年8月13日19:03,5,Great when custom songs added
2022-05-24 19:18:28.955375,"I’ve been saving up for the quest ever since it came out and the first game I wanted o it was best saber and I succeeded,I’ve played beat saber a lot before on my friends headsets and it’s the best game I’ve ever played it makes you focus on the rhythm which can help you further down the line and it also is makes exercising fun I would definitely recommend",2020年8月13日23:03,5,This game is awesome

2022-05-24 19:18:39.710074,Beatsaber is legitimately a flawless game that has me coming back time and time again.  The electronic music is absolutely perfect along side the distinctly unique visual design.  Every slash with the sabers and the satisfying sound effects whenever I slice a cube is simply magical.  The most bang for your buck!,2020年8月13日03:02,5,Unequivocally the most fun game.
2022-05-24 19:18:39.817786,I sold an xbox one and a Nintendo Switch to help fund the purchase of two of these Quest 2 units this week. Best decision I could have ever made.

VR is quickly catching up to the console wars !,2020年11月19日11:50,5,Sold a few game consoles to get these !

Despite the fact that this game has inspired the creator in me (mapping songs), it is less than desirable that since I have the quest, I’d have to buy this game again on the rift store in order to use the game editor that is part of the game when I hook my quest up to my computer, even though I have already purchased the game. So now, I have to do this whole complicated process in order to create music.",2020年8月29日22:05,4,"Wonderful game, but with consequences"
2022-05-24 19:18:50.572622,"Don’t get me wrong, the game is super fun! I have played it before on the PlayStation VR and I loved it! When, I got my Quest I got this game on it, too (obviously). On PSVR, it was so fun and amazing! But not on the Quest. It’s also much harder on the Quest. I remember beating an Expert level but on the Quest, I can hardly complete Normal. I dunno! I got some music packs and this game and enjoy. My family enjoys. So, is it worth it. Yes, if you’re new. If you’ve played it before, then you now!

But other than that I love the game, just wish it had better music to choose from. Preferably anything before 2010 or older would be a plus.

So did and God dam it I'm addicted 😭 ..... It's so smooth, the music is just insanely toe tapping and not only is the gameplay simple and gets you moving (it's JEDI lightsabers as far as I'm concerned 😍) I ended up bopping away and slashing for far too long ........

2022-05-24 19:20:05.863570,"This game is so much fun and among the best rhythm games out there if you can play custom songs. Unfortunately the developers only release music packs occasionally, and not of the most appealing songs. Rhythm games are a great fit for J-pop, K-pop and dance, instead they offer Linken Park and some random techno songs. Finally the scoring scheme is no fun as the swings have to be very big (150 degree) to get full points, which is impossible for fast songs. This is why I just hunt full combos :)",2020年8月27日03:45,4,"Amazing game, except the scoring scheme"
2022-05-24 19:20:16.423222,"I love the main game and party mode, but campaign mode there is a level where you have to move your arms at a specific speed to complete the level. I really don’t think that was a good idea but overall, I LOVE IT!",2020年9月13日05:13,4,Great distraction

2022-05-24 19:21:31.494484,Beat saber is an awesome game if You own the  headset you are supposed to legally flex it but if you don't have beat saber you cannot legally flex it You will be legally flexed on. There's only one problem the fact that there's no DLC for custom songs. If you're on PC then great it's super easy for you but as soon as you switch over to the quest your technically breaking the law if you want to get custom songs. Cuz that's technically modding I've tried getting custom songs but beat saber must have put something on it so you can't put them on anymore if you make a $30 DLC for a custom songs this wouldn't be a three-star review,2020年8月31日05:31,3,Good just would like this DLC

2022-05-24 19:22:46.514631,"Love the game, especially after they created the 360 version so you have to increase your movement.  However, that leads me to the significant disappointment I felt after purchasing the Linkin Park expansion pack and there is not a single game with a 90 or 360 mode.  They should not rush out the expansion packs where loyal customers are continuously shelling out bucks without putting in the time and effort for complete gameplay in some of the songs in the pack.",2020年8月22日09:21,4,Great game but ...

It is still the game I go to as soon as I turn my VR to get a quick play or two in. Very reminiscent of the feeling I got playing guitar hero or garage band growing up. This game is amazing with tons of different options in terms of challenge level. I can’t wait to see it grow more, it’s definitely a staple on the Quest. ￼￼",2020年8月13日05:39,5,The One
2022-05-24 19:22:57.023719,"Absolutely fantastic game and totally addicted to it. Party mode is my go to work out and it’s a phenomenal rush when you get that full combo.

I have only two gripes:

Firstly campaign. I can’t play it...

My wife started the campaign, it’s her progress in the campaign and there’s no way for me to have my own.

Granted this should be Oculus/Facebooks responsibility to enable multi user profiles on the console. However, as it doesn’t seem as though this is coming any time soon it falls to the developers to allow save slots for multiple users. 5 stars if this appears in a future update.

Secondly (a tiny one admittedly):

The playlist section is one playlist. Again a couple of playlist saves would be great. Personally, I’d like to create a casual chill playlist, a workout playlist (or 2/3) and a party playlist.

If these gripes seem picky it’s because otherwise this is a fantastic game that I have poured many hours in to with no regrets.

Looking forward to future updates (the addition of Fit Beat as a new song was perfectly timed and has kept me fit these last couple of months stuck inside)",2020年8月3日18:51,5,Great game - Multi user saves please
2022-05-24 19:22:57.115192,"I’ve had this game for only five days, but I have had so much fun playing this, especially when the song’s lyrics go along with what you have to do   in-game, such as Fit-Beat, in which the lyrics say step to the left, and if you don’t step to the left, a barrier will reset your combo. This is definitely an essential game to have on your Rift or your Quest. The only thing that I wish was different is that there was an Intermediate level between normal and hard. Other than that, the game is flipping awesome!",2020年8月3日21:57,5,Holy C***

2022-05-24 19:23:18.561392,"I got my Quest A bit after Easter and I heard such good things about this game and I bought it no regrets whatsoever. Its so good I haven’t even played nearly all the levels because they keep adding content like 360 Levels, 90 Levels, One Saber Etc. And it keeps it challenging so there is always more to come back to. Last and for all its got such good songs from OST 1, 2 and 3 + Extra which has Pop Stars, Crab rave, a fitness song and others. 

Overall good buy I think it’s one of the best things on the Quest, no money wasted!",2020年8月3日10:47,5,About 5 Months Later
2022-05-24 19:23:18.682069,"Before Beat Saber, I was decidedly skeptical of VR as all the games I tried seemed boring, and exercise was always a total chore.  After trying it, I was shocked to find that I found both the VR and the aerobics enjoyable and even so addictive that I had to purchase my own headset just to play.  Beat Saber on the Quest also has the benefit of no wires to get in the way on 360 levels.

Tip to newbies, play the campaign, it actually acts as a pretty good tutorial for leveling up in your saber skills, although some of the requirements are a little silly.  I’ve never had much hand-eye coordination in video games or sports but with consistent practice have been able to clear some expert plus levels.

The game can get a little tedious after you’ve played every song dozens of times and are stuck on the same level forever, but that’s when getting custom songs through Sidequest comes in handy to clear the boredom and make it a brand new game.  The additional DLC song packs seem well mapped (more natural motions compared to OST songs) and a nice way to support the developers as well.

Small issue with the pricing of the DLC songs though, if you buy a single song from a pack, the full cost of the song is not deducted in full if you want to complete the pack later. A pack that costs $6.99, after you buy a song for $1.99, the remaining pack is $5.24 rather than $5.00.",2020年8月2日17:53,5,Addictive fun and exercise!
2022-05-24 19:23:18.820699,"I have somewhere around 25-26 hours on this game and I absolutely love it. There’s always something new to learn and do based on the difficulties for the songs. You can slow down songs to learn them at your own pace or just go in and put on the No Fail feature and learn it from just playing the level. The other modes like 360 degrees, 90 degrees, and one handed are some of the most fun one can have in a VR and you don’t need too much space for this game. I’d recommend this to just about anybody and would even say if you’re looking to lose weight or have a fun exercise routine to purchase this game. I sometimes have issues with height placement in the game where it will think I’m taller or shorter, but backing out and going back in tends to fix that issue. Other than that, I’d say this game offers a lot of different ways to play it and is worth your money!",2020年8月3日01:26,5,Beat Saber Is Fantastic
2022-05-24 19:23:18.970299,"I bought this game as soon as I got my quest and it was great! The rhythm combined with the intensity sure make a genius combo. If my parents enjoyed it, so can everyone!",2020年8月28日23:43,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 19:23:29.194202,"Love it.  Great game, gets you moving and sweating.      I feel like Luc Skywalker.   I’m mildly addicted to it and spend a lot of time swinging my arms around the living room.  I’ve had to move furniture permanently from my tiny apartment, but it’s worth it.  The game is not perfect, for sure, but, for what it is, a fun time swinging light sabres at flying cubes, it’s great.  I’d like to see more/better house music; it wouldn’t be hard for them to find a DJ willing to give up their music to this game for next to nothing.  I feel like the 360 aspect is a little under-explored; it has great potential, but, so far, it hasn’t blown me away; how about stuff falling from the direction of the sky, from the floor, bouncing, etc; it’s very one dimensional; maybe I need to hit higher levels, but most of the stuff I’m doing now is high level.  It seems the flying objects, blocks and bombs are underutilizes was well; most of the time they just float by without being any sort of a threat.  I could be dodging and ducking more; again, perhaps I’m not at a high enough level.  Updated levels and music should be free, or only a few bucks.  I’m seeing stuff from one artist for $9+; that’s too much.  I feel like there can be more of a fitness emphasis on some levels.  So far, only one level was really geared toward being a workout.  And upgrade solely for the purpose of working out; I’d pay money for that upgrade.  Overall, a fantastic game.  Looking forward to seeing what they do with it in the future, especially the free updates. It really has endless potential for new music and levels.  My feet have blisters.",2020年8月3日01:01,5,I was born to be a Jedi.

2022-05-24 19:23:51.173778,I’m new to VR and this game is an amazing intro to all of VR,2020年10月17日01:11,5,Love this game!
2022-05-24 19:23:51.296450,"I literally love this game. It was my first purchase on the quest back Xmas 2019 when I got the headset and I still love playing it now. 
The husband enjoys it (though I’m better) :) The children love it. 
My arms always feel like they’ve had a good swim or something too after an hour or so play. 
Ended up buying a couple of the music packs as some of the main songs aren’t really my style. 
Would like to see more music packs so the game stays fresh. 
Literally only knocked a star off as I still feel the song choice is still limited. I know there are ways to side load your own but not that I know how to do 
myself.
Must have game for quest owners.",2020年8月19日09:40,4,Best game on the quest (so far)
2022-05-24 19:24:01.756302,"This game is great fun, however I wish they would let you use custom songs on oculus quest. As I think custom songs are available on PC.",2020年9月3日06:51,5,Hours of entertainment
2022-05-24 19:24:02.040542,"I'm not going to lie, the game is lots of fun. It combines a body workout with some cool songs that are very catchy. Though i wish beating the campaign would give a bonus album. The reason for this is because the campaign takes a pretty long time to beat. Yes, beatsaber had to pay to get the song (Ex: greenday album/Imagine Dragons) and yes, they released 3 more songs for free but just beating the campaign and earning a reward would be great. Still, I love the game and its getting better and better.

Sidenote: If possible, add a level creator and poster on quest. It would be a cool thing and would also catch alot of attention to much more people.",2020年7月17日05:13,5,A critique of Beatsaber.
2022-05-24 19:24:02.161219,"It's a really good game, One of the best on the Oculus Quest store, The only problem is that if you connect to Bluetooth headset to the Oculus Quest as you're playing, The cubes will become very laggy and out of sync with the music, forcing you to use some third-party accessory or an aux cable, But other than that, with all the song packs and the mods you can get, This game is a straight 10 out of 10 in my book",2020年8月1日05:44,5,Don't Use Bluetooth
2022-05-24 19:24:02.265940,Listan bucko £22 or $30 Is definitely worth this game it's so addicting THAT YOU WILL PLAY IT TO DEF but don't forget to download mods with sidequest,2020年8月30日21:12,5,Beat saber
2022-05-24 19:24:02.394597,"The blocks stutter (3 FPS), the rest of the animation is fine. This is happening for the demo as well. This is happening when I start my Quest without earphones plugged it. There is no audio until I connect the earphones. With earphones plugged in it works. Lots of songs are very short and very limited options within the different modes (360 only in easy for some songs). Instead of adding all the difficulty options in all modes, new packs are made to cash in.",2020年8月15日06:00,3,"fun, but experiencing issues"
2022-05-24 19:24:12.677826,I tried to to the bmbf and it wouldn't even let me open the beat saber app,2020年12月22日12:47,5,How do I add custom songs to beat saber
2022-05-24 19:24:12.789528,I would buy the $400 oculus JUST for this ! It is the BEST!! Only thing I would Add is letting us suggest music as well!! EMINEM would make it so I never sleep ! Best game ever !!,2020年8月25日10:55,5,Beat saber YES!
2022-05-24 19:24:12.951098,This is honestly my favorite VR game that I’ve ever played it’s like a mix of garage band and fruit ninja,2020年9月8日05:33,5,Best VR game ever
2022-05-24 19:24:13.104688,VR isn’t as simple as picking up a controller and being ready to go. VR can be a bit discomforting at first. Thankfully Beat Saber is one of those games you can pick up and go without being hit with a wave of nausea. The simple arcade nature makes it simple for anyone to play.,2020年8月5日04:04,5,Best game to dip your toes into VR
2022-05-24 19:24:13.241323,"This is an amazing fun Game it’s so addicting you can play it for hours upon hours, I just wish there was a way to get custom sabers and songs without getting copyrighted. Otherwise BEST GAME EVER",2020年8月21日10:54,5,AMAZING.
2022-05-24 19:24:23.515466,"Beyond happy when I played this game. Its interactive and fun and a great workout. 
I love the different music and levels. Appreciative of the new music packs that are coming out. 
Worth the money!",2020年8月21日07:57,5,My first VR game!

2022-05-24 19:24:23.746807,"I came into this game thinking that I could play any song I want, and just jam out to it, but it’s not that, it’s not that at all. It’s 100% just a bunch of techno rock, you can’t search the song that you want, but if you’re into that then it’ll be heaven for you, but it’ll get old pretty quick, + it’s a lot of just the same songs at different difficulties.",2020年6月30日15:55,1,It’s not what you think.

2022-05-24 19:24:24.003123,"I Love this game! As a new oculus owner, this has been a very fun experience. Slicing up blocks makes you feel good! The only downside is that you have to pay for more songs, and downloading BMBF is tricky without a YouTube tutorial. Other than that though, it’s great!",2020年8月9日16:09,5,Great game!
2022-05-24 19:24:34.283708,This game ALONE made me want a VR headset!!!! Absolutely amazing!,2020年9月20日09:19,5,Insane
2022-05-24 19:24:34.443289,"So I got my oculus quest just before the corona virus outbreak and beat saber was the first game I got and if I’m being honest, it’s probably one of the best vr games out there to start playing vr with. It’s great for starting because there is any active movement making it so you can easily transition into vr games with more movement. It’s a great game",2020年7月31日05:14,5,Great game
2022-05-24 19:24:34.576925,I bought my quest right before the pandemic of covid 19 this was one of the first games I bought . I have played this on easy and hard still trying to get to expert but I also have other games I play as well. When i need a good workout this is it for me. Only thing i don't like about this is I've got all the expansions for music and I am still waiting on more would love to see beat saber release a classic rock package and one for tool. Alot of people use sidequest to upload their songs but for those of us with out a PC this is difficult to do other than that no complaints here......,2020年7月30日15:10,5,One of the first must haves
2022-05-24 19:24:34.691617,"Beware, highly addicting. When I first played it it was fun, sure. But after a while I really got caught in it, it grew more and more on me. After completing the campaign I side loaded more custom songs and now there is no limit on how much I can play this. You really get better and better as you play. I struggled a lot with hard songs, but now expert is what I play for fun and expert+ when I want a challenge. My kids love it as well and is getting pretty good at it :)",2020年7月30日23:57,5,Just awesome
2022-05-24 19:24:34.805314,"I won our occulous, and was stoked because in the middle of a pandemic who has funds for VR headsets?!?!

Beat Saber was the FIRST game we purchased. And let me tell you. It's the MOST visited game in our library!

We LOVE the sword play, the music, the immersion! It's ""undercover"" exercise and everyone in out house enjoys it from 13-50 years old.

NO motion sickness. Controls are user friendly. Beats are worthy.

We LOVE this game!",2020年7月31日09:01,5,Amazing Fu
2022-05-24 19:24:45.084467,I like this game because me and my family can play this on game nights. And it has the feature that slowed you to change the difficulty of the level from easy to expert plus. So it’s a hit with the family the only catch is that you need a pc to download songs. But otherwise one of the most addictive games I have ever played.,2020年7月31日01:08,5,It’s really nice
2022-05-24 19:24:45.209132,"I’m a big guitar hero guy, so I thought I would like this game, and was super hype to play it, but the game is way too easy. I beat my first hard mode song in my first hour of playing, my first expert on my second day, and my first expert plus probably on my 4th or 5th day. it was pretty fun, but I didn’t fee like I earned my progression as I did in guitar hero, since guitar hero takes much, much longer to get good at.  This game has a stupid campaign that only takes you up to early expert mode, and most of it is stupid rule sets where If you fc it you will lose.  On top of that pretty much no one has heard of any of the songs on here and the dlc are a bit over priced. But the main problem is it costs 30 bucks to hit some cubes. Overall an ok game and I would recommend tbh",2020年8月4日13:46,3,A little doodoo
2022-05-24 19:24:45.338785,"it’s a very good game, espacialy if you like music and being active. it’s also great for quarentine, and i recomend onward as well for your next game if you like guns like me.",2020年8月24日09:09,5,great game

2022-05-24 19:25:06.803546,"I love the game and it’s so much better without the wires, but I really feel that the variety is nonexistent. On the steam version you had people creating free songs, and they were good. We had things like rap god and songs by skillet on it. I am by no means saying to only include certain songs. I also think a make your own mode that you could publish and play others songs would be great. If you release a update with more variety I can tell you that this is five stars. I just don’t think I can go that far with the variety.

Edit. This is bull. I have recently learned that the game used to have this feature but now doesn’t. Greedy jerks. You ruined a good thing. I don’t even know what to say, you just earned a one star a-holes.",2020年6月26日02:17,1,"Good, but variety would be nice."

2022-05-24 19:25:17.571293,"This game is a lot of fun and me and my friend really enjoy trying to beat each other’s scores and beat all the imagine dragons songs. All I’m saying is it would be AWSOME if the devs added astronomia (coffin dance) to the free section and deja vu and all the meme songs. That would be awsome!!! It’s a bit frustrating on expert + when you get all the way through a song and you miss one single block at the end and instantly fail the song. Yes that has happened to me and it was very annoying. There’s a slight problem with the blade where I hit a block and it just fazes right through it and it says miss, so yeah devs please fix that. Other than that this game is amazing and I have so much fun playing.",2020年7月29日22:36,5,This game is amazing!

2022-05-24 19:26:11.313797,"I have owned my oculus quest for about 6 months now ,and nothing has me coming back like beat saber.
The second i got my quest out of the box and on my head i downloaded the beatsaber demo,despite the song being on easy it was a very enjoyable experience i found myself returning to the demo just to beat my high score

a week Later I bought the full game and played through the campaign, which was a very enjoyable experience  the challenge slowly ramps up from easy to expert and it goes from beating a song just for highscores to hardly beating it the song at all 

AND GETING A FULL CARDIO WORK OUT

however after finishing the campaign and all the songs (which took around 1 month) i found myself re playing songs and looking for some variety 

Now we get to the funest part,mods
Moding the game to be able to add our own songs opens up the game to infinite replay ability the sheer amount of songs downloadable on the internet is amazing and music makes you want to exersize even more

in a nutshell;
campaign is a blast
in game Music is good 
Good replayability 
custom songs only add to the personal enjoyment factor
A masterpiece of rythm games",2020年7月28日20:57,5,An absolute masterpiece

Then the extra packs are just price gouging. I don't believe there is any reason not to include an option to play your own music with out having to resort to hacks.

2022-05-24 19:27:07.037322,The quest is definitely the best way to play this because you have to cord in your way. And if you get bored of the songs and don’t want to pay for dlc there is custom songs! So you can play just about any song on here.

2022-05-24 19:27:39.002180,"If the Oculus store has nothing but Beat Saber, my purchase would still have been worth it!  This gave take advantage of all the best of the medium.  You become part of the game in many ways.  It’s also a hell of a workout especially if you lean into the body movements, beats, and sounds.  Go to town! Nobody is watching.  Practice for that next wedding.

This game also teaches you how your body learns things.  Practice, practice and mistakes and practice.  But the difference is that is NEVER boring to practice,  it sneaks up on you how good you become. You will hit songs that you will swear you are incapable of doing, before you know it you will surprise yourself what you can do. 

This does everything right, BUT...Just one note to the developer.  I play this on Vive/Steam as well as Quest, as I want to take it with me.  The haptics and feel of slicing the blocks aren’t quite right in Quest yet.  Still great, but it’s a combo if the vibration amount and the way the blocks sound/slice viscerally connects better with Steam VR and Vive.  give us the ability to up the vibration too please.

2022-05-24 19:28:22.339924,"i have the PC version of this and thought ok lets get the quest version for on the go it'll be just as good

oh how wrong i was 

the quest version is not enjoyable at all

i can understand the graphical downgrades but the following things is whats pushing me so far away from this version of the game

1. the life bar is completely broken. when you miss a block it goes down so fast but hardly goes back up at all leaving me with having to keep no fail on at all times to beat an easy song i can easily do on the PC version without no fail on

2. theres TONS OF SOUND LAG. for a rhythm game you want everything to be in sync but this version doesn't do that even with the audio override it doesn't sync like how can you mess that up

3. the rumble is too weak to the point where i had to mod the game to make it better.

4. the sound effects are too quiet compared to the pc version where again i had to mod the game to fix this myself

fix all the issues above and maybe then i'll enjoy the quest version more but until then if you're looking to play beat saber on the quest play the PC version with oculus link its a way better experience over all

i'm very disappointed in this version of the game come on beat games you can do better then this!",2020年8月2日03:50,2,disappointed with this version

From initial struggling flailing through to challenging expert mode on some of the longer songs this game has had me moving, laughing and enjoying myself greatly.

Fantastic game to take the edge off quarantine lockdown, with a wide range of modes and modifiers to allow you to keep challenging yourself even when you are familiar with a song. It's great to discover a new fun track and realise that there's even more game than you thought, over and over! Just as I was getting comfortable with trying every track for the first time on Hard + Fast Song modifier I thought to check out some of the new tracks and BOY was that another level!

In short, Beatsaber may have been one of the early VR titles but it really nailed the experience and holds up fantastically even today.

2022-05-24 19:29:59.363567,"So I'm not gonna state the obvious reasons about how this game is gods gift to quest, but something else this game did that completely caught me by suprise...

So I first get my quest and set it up with vr chat and beat Saber, the two must-have quest titles, and I start playing beat saber. Now I'm a pretty scrawny guy, a total nerd who hates getting out of the house. But after a few weeks of beat saber, through some events I go to my friends house, and he has this pull-up bar in his hallway... attempt to use it, and I did like 5 pull-ups. This may sound stupid, but a few weeks ago I wasn't even able to do a push-up, much less a pull-up. And thats when I realized, I'm developing actual muscles playing a VIDEO GAME. A video game SO fun, that I didn't stop to think about how I'm actually doing a workout.

So here is my list of very noticeable improvements playing this game after only a few weeks. Increased range of motion - I swing wide to improve this,   better concentration - I zoned in half a song now I can do about 5 in row before my mind wanders, better focus - I am hitting with more accuracy and seeing the cube orientation faster,  better reflexes,  weight loss, more flexibility, more speed.

But the pay wall is pretty bad and that's what costs the stars.
This game has so much potential. You could get any song in this game and play for hundreds and hundreds of hours, but instead there are 50% of the songs you can play free and these are the mostly boring ones, and the other stuff costs you either money per song or per collection. I know licenses are expensive, but the most songs here are not really close to popular. Even the new Timbaland songs are a collection of let's say not the most popular ones.

All in all anyways the best game and still better than all the copycat games of it.",2020年8月6日22:48,4,Usually 5 Star but

Side Note: by design fault, when you whip the controllers around hard enough, the AA battery inside the controller will dislodge which will cause a controller tracking issue. It's a controller design flaw. The spring on the negative end of the battery isn't strong enough to hold the battery in place.

Rhythm games are already really fun, but this paved the way for games like Pistol Whip and others.

This game does really well with the lack of resistance with the controllers, which in most games is a problem. The feeling of the sabers slashing through cubes like warm knives through butter is satisfying as hell.

A lot of the beatmaps made by the game devs have a really good flow and are satisfying to move throughout.

2022-05-24 19:31:36.853419,"music.

I'm enjoying playing Beat Saber.  It is super fun but most of the music is not my taste, at all.  
If we had the option to add our own music, that would be amazing and worth an extra star.  

I had read a comment or review somewhere that with SideQuest, this was possible.  I don't know as Side Quest won't work on my computer.  I've tried but the processor is not good enough apparently.  To run Side Quest, you need at least a 2500, but mine is 2450. So.... 

I play and am addicted to AudioShield because I can use my own music.  I really get into it playing my own tunes.  

Saying this though, I really am having fun with Beat Saber.  I found 4 songs that I favourited so they are easy to find and I just use them now, at least until pop, oldies, R & B / Soul are options.

I'm lovin' using these fun exercise apps.  I can see me now getting into the best shape I've ever been in as I play these apps almost daily, even several times a day, because they are so addictive.

Seriously, from someone who used to hate to exercise, I'm now lovin' it.  I can't get enough :)",2020年8月4日04:27,4,Would be 5 stars if I could add my own

This game is amazing, super fun, and is one of the only VR games I have spent hours at a time playing.

2022-05-24 19:31:47.712690,"If your hesitant about getting this game with fear of either getting bored or getting tired of it in general (like most games I've played). Get this game, the only time you'll want to stop playing it is due to being sore from the exercise. The campaign is a tad short but you don't play a game like this cause it tells a story.... Campaign really shouldn't be the word for it to be honest, more like tutorial build up to play on expert+, but campaign is easier to fit on the menu I guess. There is plenty of songs to start with on the game to keep you busy for a while specially if this your first time experiencing a game such as Rock Band or Guitar hero... For those familiar with them games though it will still keep you busy for some time then there's dlc that you can get that's fair on price as well... I'd recommend Imagine Dragons for both first timers and pros alike. If this argument won't get you to change your mind then your loss friend because this is a great game. I'd recommend it to everyone even my nephew, age 10, loved this game... Almost lost my occulus quest cause he was addicted to the game.

This game takes me back to my late 90’s rave days when I danced all night and played with glow sticks. The maps are perfectly synced to the music and once you get them, the feeling of smashing the blocks to the beat is amazing.

The only thing that's missing currently is a custum songs menu, sure there are the packs of songs you can buy and you can sideload the custom songs using a computer app but it'd be great to have it as an official function

Also the expandability of the game makes it so much better, I just got the green day music pack the other day, and all of the songs were very fun and well mapped. And also if you have a laptop anywhere you can get any song you want for free! Of course, some may not be well mapped, but some maps are mapped perfectly.

But

I marked down two stars for the music variety. In campaign, you’re, what feels like, playing the same 3 techno songs with different objectives. If In kfree play you want something that isn’t the pill head tent at a festival you’ve got to pay extra! I bought the imagine dragons music add one which I love but paying an extra 10.99 for it is making the game so expensive to play!

Otherwise it would be 5 stars",2020年8月3日18:15,3,"Amazing game but please, no more techno!"

2022-05-24 19:33:57.055984,"I been playing one of your rivals moon rider for a while and enjoyed it but there was some problems so I got this game. Those problems are gone but some new ones have arrived. Here's the pros and cons and improvements:

Pros: hit detection is superior to it's rivals thanks to larger blocks.
wide area of play allowing for a smoother experience and easier to hit blocks.

Cons/improvements: not many songs for price but that will improve over time naturally.
a lot of the songs seem to be missing large chunks of the song so that immediately throws you off.
The ducking walls are a good same nightmare for is talk people despite calibration.
There's no way to adjust the vibration intensity as more me it's too high when hitting blocks and especially when touching sabers.
It doesn't feel smooth to play overall because of the track design since there in a situation where your arms work separately rather than in unison.
It doesn't feel smooth because the method of hitting the blocks are mixed together such as switching from an up and down to a side to side without a noticeable break or sound change to justify it.
Some songs lag so sound to vibration and visuals are out of sync such as overkill and as a musician it just makes you want to drop the controllers.

Overall I want to like this game but at this stage currently it feels like I'm forcing myself to like it hope to see some improvements in the future.",2020年11月10日07:08,2,Suggestions and opinions

However, the custom songs available on the Rift and other VR formats would be an excellent addition for the Quest, as it helps make the game more interesting towards people who want to play their favorite songs.

Boy, does this game make me sweat! It’s both deceptively easy to pick up and play and incredibly deep and challenging. It doesn’t hold back on making you sweat, but it does so while providing a really fun and gorgeous game for you to enjoy. It’s basically a Trojan horse for getting a good cardio exercise. 

I highly recommend the game to anyone with a VR headset, period. Hopefully you can play it on the Quest in its full, untethered glory.

Here is the solution. GET CUSTOM SONGS! I don’t see why all of these people are giving 1 star reviews because there isn’t custom songs. But there is, there are many tutorials online which tell you how to do it and I found that it was easy as. I am now open to hundreds and hundreds of different songs from different genres.

It’s so simple to understand. And if you practice it enough, you’ll be able to really impress your friends. They will be happy about how they completed a level on normal difficulty, then you go and get a full combo on expert+. 

Another way this game is 100% worth it to buy is because with some mods, you can download custom songs. This means that there’s is always something new! 

If I could, I’d give this game a 6 star review, it’s that good!",2020年7月30日15:44,5,Great for party’s

2022-05-24 19:36:06.770276,I love the app and play it for hours every day but there is one thing about it that I think is pretty ridiculous which is the in app purchases I already paid 30 dollars for the game and now to get the extra gameplay I need money which is unusual,2020年8月7日11:15,4,I love it but there is one thing
2022-05-24 19:36:06.901923,"Don't get me wrong. This game is fantastic and I love playing, it's just that the songs suck. The only one that I like is crab rave. The campaign is also a little bit lacky too, it's not a campaign it's levels with variation, you could've put some effort in and made a story, I don't care how cringey it would be. And why, why couldn't you have introduced a song maker or import community creations onto the quest port? Why?! We could've made our own songs not buy a stupid dlc when pc players get them for free. Please fix this, I kinda regret buying this game after realising there is no good content in it.",2020年7月27日19:00,4,Great game! But most of the songs suck

Ik just because I don’t like this game means that it’s a bad game, Ik that other people may like this game. 


The music genre for games is not for me and I hate how many new types there are, I really hope someone important sees this because I speak for a lot of people when I say that we want OTHER GENRES the same games are being released like the music shooter ones, ITS BASICALLY THE SAME GAME. Idk why people buy it but I like many others want something different like a online fps, a survival game, medieval, or even a medical type game so wider audiences can enjoy vr.",2020年6月7日05:09,1,OVERRATED and over priced

2022-05-24 19:36:17.522306,"I do NOT regret the Purchase of this game and ALL of the Pack. This game is worth every cent! Form the Songs, to the Feeling of hitting the Notes, makes it one of, if not the most Satisfying games ever. I think it is safe to say that there will never be a game that comes close too a game that will be such a Universally, the most expendable game. Anyone can jump into this game, From a newcomer to games too the Elite of gamers, It 100% will not, nor will it ever be a mistake to buy this game. Thank you for reading this review, and hope you Agree or end up buying the game because of this game. 

If you are thinking of buying this game but have any questions about the game, feel free to contact me through my oculus account.

2022-05-24 19:37:00.707962,"I specialise in FPS games, so when I heard that some “random” game was blowing up on vr, I thought nothing of it, didn’t read the reviews and didn’t watch any clips.
However, after it was recommended to me by half of my friends, I decided to try it, expecting nothing good.
I played the demo version and again, didn’t think anything of it. The demo version was plain, just 1 song with getting every move wrong. 
Then, I heard about refunds and decided to check out the real deal, knowing that if I didn’t like it, I could easily refund it. 
I was blown away.
Beat Saber is like a whole other world, literally..

I now play it 6 hours or so every day, it really helped me with overall fitness, and I’m gonna be real, this game is made for everybody, forget about pistol whip, superhot, etc. T

This game is gonna grow bigger and bigger
Mark my words",2020年10月16日04:00,5,I thought it was bad..

2022-05-24 19:37:22.114672,I think beat saber os one of the best suited games for oculus quest,2020年8月24日05:02,5,One of the best
2022-05-24 19:37:22.222417,"I'll compare it to Dance Central VR (DCVR) [ I absolutely luv too] which is also an excellent rhythm game, but much less popular. This will emphasise what Beat Sabre has nailed.

THE GOOD:

(1) The 5 difficulty levels for each song means that that it's learning curve is gradual for the first set of difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard), then the last two (Expert, Expert+) are more suited to those who are addicted or just have Jedi skills. 
DCVR's downfall was having only 2 difficulty levels. Easy to get into, but hard to master (so most gave up completely).

(2) Absolutely anyone can play due to it's simplicity. I believe this is why it's popular and because swinging and slicing boxes feels natural and very satisfying.
DCVR on the other hand appears to be very niche (interest). Also ppl aren't natural dancers which would be off putting. I ranked high on the DC leaderboards, but I definitely never had any FINESSE when dancing a routine.

(3) This is the only game where I've found that 'muscle memory' has had a huge impact to the game. I'm able to slices boxes with my hands moving simultaneouly in different directions without consciously thinking about it. It makes me feel like Superman, and therefore is very satisfying.
DCVR is polar opposite. I had to painstakingly learn routines, with large amount of time in the studio, rather than actually dancing.

THE BAD:

(1) The game is sold at top price which I believe is way over priced. This is a very simple game conceptually and the development effort requied to build it would have been minimal. I enjoy the game, but at the same time feel rorted solely because it has proven popular / in demand. I have deducted one star rating because of this.
DCVR's development would have been many times greater taking into account;
- 7 room scale locations in a nightclub
- modelling of DC buddies and NPC crowd
- motion capture of dance routines
- system that needs to evaluate players movements in comparison to the dance routine

(2) Songs are mostly EDM (without lyrics) from unknown artists. The popular music is performed by only several artists (each artist has many songs to choose from) which is all DLC at additional cost.",2020年7月27日10:52,4,"Very good, but not value for your money!"
2022-05-24 19:37:22.348061,"I’ll admit it. I love this game so much. I’ve been playing it nonstop and I’ve broken a sweat every single time. What helps is that two of my favorite songs are in the game. But, I must admit I was a little disappointed when I found out the amount of songs. There wasn’t a lot. Sure there was many, but I thought there was going to be more. I realize you can get more through sidequest, but I don’t have a good PC for gaming. So, what would I wish they fixed? An opportunity for people without PCs to still be able to gain access to additional songs, and a bigger library. Other than that this game is incredible!",2020年7月25日21:47,4,"Great game, wish there was a bit more"
2022-05-24 19:37:22.474742,"This game, is basically perfection in VR. First of all, difficulties fit for everyone, second of all, mods.

2022-05-24 19:37:33.076518,Bruh don’t believe what the 1-3 stars are telling you this is a MUST HAVE VR GAME and if you don’t get it that Santa will give you 10 tons of coal this year! All seriousness tho the game is uber fun and you CAN have CUSTOM SONGS with the quest version you just need to have a computer for the first part then you are able to use the quest afterwards even when getting new songs you just need to install side quest on computer then load in BMBF into your quest and then on the quest you open BMBF and get nearly ANY and EVERY song on beatsaber,2020年7月8日03:32,5,Lies
2022-05-24 19:37:33.182234,At first I couldn't understand all of the hype around Beat Saber as it was a pretty simple game but after sinking hours into the game I have to say it is incredible. Breaking boxes has weight to it and personally I find it so much more satisfying that all of the other rhythm games on the quest. Only real problem is the lack of custom songs but sideloading is always an option. Definite must have for the quest.,2020年7月7日19:11,5,A masterpiece.

It's basicly a workout game that you have to break these block's, and as you break them, you get better at the game that maybe you can even halde on expert+! It's super fun and i would recommened it. It's worth the 30 dollars, and just buy it!",2020年7月7日13:44,5,It's good.
2022-05-24 19:37:44.228292,This is an amazing game. I have had it for a while and just bought the Green Day pack recently. The only complaint is that the songs are censored. After a while you get used to it. This game is a must get.,2020年7月27日00:55,5,It’s turned into an addiction

2022-05-24 19:38:05.721014,"Now in terms of a fun and energetic game this is pretty brilliant. However on the oculus quest it's..... limited. While its an obvious must have it only has so much variety in comparison to the pc version and the plethora of community generated content. You'll go through the avalible songs and their variants fast and the cost of more song packs really starts to add up. 

By all means buy the game though. It is fun as all get out. But I know I'll be tinkering until I can get steam working on here so I can keep playing it after I've finished listening to the same stuff so many times I wanna pull my hair out.",2020年7月25日06:07,4,Not bad at all.

2022-05-24 19:38:16.398476,"There's not much to be said which haven't been said already. It's a great title, alot of fun and a pretty good workout aswell!

I would wish for more songs and variation. Genres aswell customization options. The game is quite old by now and I feel it's not being updated as frequently as it could've been.

I'm aware of modding options, I've tried it and it comes with too many downsides for my liking and I'd much rather want to support the development of the game when they add more music for my liking. I did purchase the game with imagine dragons and oh god those songs are great! I would love to see some rap, rock and pop songs. Eminem, hopsin, Billie eilish, tones and I, disturbed, dragonforce. Something along those lines. I would not hesitate to drop more dough if artist like this would pop up In the game",2020年7月7日07:08,5,Amazing game and an absolute must have!

It’s just a suggestion that would let people play sound that aren’t just songs on the music packs.,2020年7月6日05:31,5,I love it!

Perfect for fans of rhythm games (and hell, Star Wars fans as well). A lovely workout on the arms, and extremely addictive. Just remember to allow your arms some rest when you're just beginning, because boy oh boy, expect the soreness.

Other sport/dancing/climbing games fall low compared to this masterpiece. The only negative thing is that there are almost no rock/punk/metal songs to play. It's a pity.

Song selection is pretty good even though I’d never heard most of them until I started playing this game. The music packs are quite enjoyable too(I only have three of them at the minute but do plan on getting the rest at some point) but I do hope more songs are added in the future. Personally I would love to see a League of Legends music pack(Such as the warsongs like piercing light) and a Two steps from Hell pack.

I still have more levels to beat, and there are additional songs you can buy, but I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.

2022-05-24 19:41:41.051732,I basically bought a quest just for this game after seeing videos on line of it. The game is intuitive and a lot of fun to play. The song selection is minimal but the songs they do have to play are enjoyable. The game doesn’t utilize the built in streaming feature and oculus quest itself has a weird casting issue so to play with friends is a little frustrating as they can see what’s on screen through casting but can’t hear the sound. Other than that the game is a blast to play and I’ve been told there is a way to download other songs to play outside of the game itself which would remedy the likelihood of the game becoming stale over time.,2020年7月22日15:42,4,Really fun game with some drawbacks

If you want imagination and freedom, this is your game. How do you come up with a game with a plot no one could ever come up with and yet so brilliantly created. I can tell this game took a lot of imagination to even think of! Slashing blocks to the beat of music, while dodging walls and trying not to hit spike bombs! I couldn’t think of that in a thousand years. You have a verity of music! Freedom is choices, and boy does this game have choices. I didn’t think I’d like the songs when I originally got the game, I had already listened to most of the songs and thought that they weren’t good. Then I played the music on the game, I had started playing and realized how exciting the music was. Before you know it, I actually started realizing that this helped me lose weight.

Although Imagine dragons pack is worth it, the rest I dont really know so I dont buy them. After you play them all and get good, I recommend getting custom songs.

2022-05-24 19:44:09.136618,"I tried the Demo last December and was concreted, partly because of the song 'Escape' and how easy it was to pick up and play.

This is significant to me as I'm not the best at rhythm games, particularly DDR as mentioned or even Rock Band since in those games, your only options were either too easy (and boring) or downright impossible (and not fun) and those game required you to get good in order to have fun or you fail, game over. This game certainly has that level of complexity (Expert+ is almost GH3 levels of insane) but that's why I'm happy that there are level modifiers so that this game's audience is not isolated and beginners like me can enjoy the songs on 'Easy' or 'Normal' (No shame!) while also getting a workout.

The Campaign would be my only nitpick though as the later levels have ridiculous winning conditions like having to deliberately miss notes so as not to cross a combo threshold, but that risks failing the level anyway. Thankfully its entirely optional as everything in the game from songs to visuals to colours (bar DLC) is available to you and you don't have to unlock anything to just jump in and have fun cutting cubes to rather awesome music.

In terms of 'Rhythm' and 'Music' games on the Oculus Quest, I recommend this over the others, though the Demo gave me leeway to try before buying and a slight bias, I might look elsewhere though for specifically 'Dancing' and 'Fitness' as harder levels require less arm movement and there's only one song that focusses on fitness.

Honestly, there should be more Demos on the Oculus Store!",2020年6月26日18:40,5,Fruit Ninja x DDR

2022-05-24 19:44:20.184092,"First, I'm going to talk about the game and then I'll talk about the quest port. 

Beat Saber is a very addictive game that's easy for everyone to pick up but hard to master. It combines simple mechanics with rhythm based gaming for a unique experience. The game itself is amazing and is definitely worth a try and I highly reccomend that you do so.

The quest port however isn't as great. If this is your first time playing then this section won't be as meaningful. But if you're coming from PCVR then you're going to want to hear this.

The game will cheat you out of a lot of hits. No, not because it's rigged or anything but because, for some unknown reason, some hits just won't register. It's not a tracking issue nor is it a sound sync issue. It's almost like after ""x"" amount of blocks, the next one will be off beat by just enough to make you miss if you're on rhythm. I've played Beat Saber both through this quest version and the link version and it's only a problem with the standalone app. And with about 150 hours sunk into the pc version, I think it's more than just ""I'm playing bad."" I feel like this is a legitimate concern as I couldn't play for more than an hour before wanting to return it. (I got denied even though I never went over 2 hours, I kept track, and owned it for less than 3 hours.)

So, tldr:

This game is worth it and you should totally give it a shot. But if you're coming from PCVR or even PSVR you might want to reconsider.",2020年10月23日14:47,3,From a PCVR perspective

2022-05-24 19:44:30.926910,"I like this game a lot! Like many I suppose. However, this game gets really fun only once you’ve helped it a bit. There’s a great community out there",2020年7月25日11:18,5,"Very fun, with some help"
2022-05-24 19:44:41.178121,!!!,2020年8月28日20:14,5,Brilliant
2022-05-24 19:44:41.333666,"Why do I have to play those missplay missions on the campaign? I can not skip them and they are so tedious those missions like ""keep the combo below this number"" or ""make this number of bad cuts"" man it gets frustrating and it takes my attention away from the game.
Anyway this game is awesome and I love it, but I just stopped enjoying the campaign",2020年7月13日23:48,4,"I've got only one complaint,"
2022-05-24 19:44:41.511192,Ok so this game is really addicting to me. But I have one problem. When are we going to see new music? It’s been a long time and have been waiting patiently for more music. I don’t want to put my headset into developer mode and get music the alternative way. But I really want more music. I bought this game so that it would be just like the ones for the pc. I want music packs such as Dojo Cat or Ariana Grande. When will we have more music?,2020年7月13日18:39,4,Amazing but We meed More Music
2022-05-24 19:44:41.653811,"This game is by far my favorite game. If I feel like I haven't had enough exercise today, I play. If I'm feeling down and wanna cut stuff while jamming to sick beats, I play. If I'm just bored, I play.

But where the heck is online multiplayer? I wanna play competitively against my friends, in the moment. Not switching out users on a headset, or checking the score later, but being able to host a match, and when all players are ready, start the song. I look to my left and I see their avatar swinging to differently themed blocks. I can see their score compared to mine. It'd be amazing. And I thought I heard this was supposed to happen like... a year ago?",2020年7月13日15:56,4,Super fun but...
2022-05-24 19:44:41.782468,"The graphics and what they have you do is so simple anyone with a basic understanding will know what to do, yet I’ve been able to play hours of it and I have yet to manage to beat any expert + levels",2020年7月16日05:52,5,It’s a simple yet gracious game

You should get it",2020年7月29日08:28,5,Bad until good
2022-05-24 19:44:52.204221,If you play on fast music mode some songs can really work up a sweat. It is was I was hoping for to have a fun exercise size app. Soon I will get some ankle/wrist weights and really get a workout.,2020年7月17日00:08,5,Fun and good excersize
2022-05-24 19:44:52.329885,Beat saber is such a wonderful game. The beating soundtrack and you hitting the blocks with lightsabers never gets old. I would recommend if they allowed mods though but overall it has extra music packs. If you are new please get this first it’s a great start,2020年7月3日23:25,5,Beat saber is hard to beat
2022-05-24 19:44:52.463527,is it just me that cant post videos of me playing beatsabor on facebook after i record myself or is everyone banned,2020年8月9日05:07,1,why am i banned from posting videos
2022-05-24 19:44:52.577223,I have had the pleasure of playing this game for only an hour i played on expert+ and i fell in love with it this game is by far my favorite vr game ever and no game has ever been able to beat it it is just phenomenal every time i start up this game it just makes me so so happy it is absolutely worth buying a quest but the only problem is that i have played all songs on all difficulties and it just seems to easy. The only thing that can make this better would be the custom songs to just be there next to solo and do what other games like happy wheels did and have an online builder and you can make your own songs that way,2020年6月10日14:08,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 19:45:02.868834,"I first thought that there was only one option for beat saber songs and the difficulty was the only way to change things up. But I was very wrong. Not only are there different ways to play, such as one saber and 360 degrees, but there is also a whole bunch of modifiers that you can apply to make it easier or harder, such as no arrows or ghost notes. (Which I found very challenging) All of that to say that it is going to take a crud ton of playing to get bored of this game and it is definitely worth the $30, even though this might seem pricey to some people. Great game 👍",2020年6月11日03:37,5,Super fun and modifiable
2022-05-24 19:45:03.665105,"Pros: 
Excellent aerobic workout - playing this game on hard or higher for as little as half an hour will defiantly get your heart rate up. 

Sense of accomplishment - as you progress through the difficulties and get experience, what seemed like an impossibility will seem like second nature after a short while. 

Endlessly replayable - the game is just satisfying to play, whether just trying to beat your high score, trying to ace a level or just to relax after work


Cons:
Limited songs - the majority of official songs available are either originals or a mere handful of songs from artists you may or may not like. If playing songs you know it's a must (Like for my wife) check out the song list before you purchase unless your happy downloading fan made levels. 

Unresponsive controls - might be just my unit, but several times the lag  between moving the controller and the game responding has been at least half a second causing me to miss easy notes, which for a rythem game is kinda bad 


Overall: 
Although the single most expensive game I've purchased to date, it's also the game I've played the most, whether in my lunch break at work, or at home.

The time commitment per session is miniscule (Got 10 minutes? you got time to play) so it's easy to get into. 

You can play it competitively at parties to see who can get the best score, or by yourself just to master the the thrill. 

Defiantly recommend",2020年6月25日16:18,5,Excellent title
2022-05-24 19:45:03.765787,"Initially I wondered if it was a good idea to purchase beat saber but after a few hours of playing, i realized it was a lot of fun and definitely worth the money. It also is a good way to exercise and or be ready for the day!",2020年7月19日17:31,5,Really fun to play!
2022-05-24 19:45:03.869539,"Beat saber is honestly the most exciting and engaging VR game I've ever played, not only does it allow players to express their song ideas into a game via web Inputs, but it also allows the players to engage in a challenging but fun experience.

2022-05-24 19:45:25.771398,The game is very very fun but there is some flaws. For one the campaign is terrible. It feels more like a chore to finish the campaign.

In reality, you can play the game with minimal physical activity, but it is so much more fun to chop those cubes with big sweeping movements. When I first started playing, I looked at the EXPERT level of difficulty and thought that it would be impossible to survive the onslaught! But now that’s all I play. My coordination has improved greatly through many hours of play.  Many times, I have become so immersed in the game, that I move out of fear of cutting myself with the light saber.

Some times you really just need to focus on few seconds and it would be amazing to have that section on repeat",2020年6月23日23:09,5,The game you need to have

The levels are so much fun and the music packs are really good ones. The only thing I could suggest updating/adding would be the implementation of being able to add your own custom songs to make it more fun. Other than that, the game is amazing. I recently began to try the 360° version and I've fallen in love with it.

Another reason I really love this game is because it doesn't affect me - as in it doesn't make me nauseous like most other games that require in-game movement when your actual body isn't.",2020年7月11日03:09,4,Loved it.

They always update the game and put brand new songs and music packs. They have many great songs like monster cat, rocket league, panic at the disco, imagine dragons, timbaland and green day and have many other great artist. The game is addictive and a good time killer if your bored. Some of the songs do come with their own maps and saber colors like rocket league. The game is also very active so it's easy to get tired. You can play 360 or 90 degree levels and modify it to challenge yourself like ghost blocks or to make the game easier like no fail. You can also try get on the leader board for a level or challenge your friends for a better score for people who are competitive.

2022-05-24 19:48:19.821393,"Beat saber is definitely my favorite game to play on Oculus, and I’ve had so much fun playing it, however, new music packs need to come out more frequently in order to keep its players coming back. The music packs also need to be packs by bigger artists. There are a few packs with big names attached to them like, panic at the disco, imagine dragons, and Green Day, and these packs are my favorite ones to play, but we just need more. 
For example, a post Malone or Travis Scott pack would sell amazingly, but instead the devs decide to give timbaland his own pack instead of someone more noteworthy. I really like this game but it needs better packs",2020年7月8日07:53,4,Beat saber review
2022-05-24 19:48:30.062994,"Many times, we use Beat Saber for exercise.

Hard is about a normal difficulty, while expert feels near impossible when you're first starting out. Otherwise, a flawless game everybody should try at least once.",2020年7月8日02:42,4,Amazing
2022-05-24 19:48:30.316318,The gap between hard and extreme is pretty big and hard is to easy but extreme is way to hard but it is a great way to exercise during lockdown and the great part is you don’t need to think while you’re playing you can close your eyes and just listen you automatically beat the level flawlessly with an easy SS ranking,2020年6月20日08:27,5,Difficulty settings

2022-05-24 19:48:41.153704,"I never used to find what was so attractive about Beat Saber. I had watched youtubers and friends play it but never really understood what the big deal was. Then I played it myself.  I completely got it as soon as I put the headset on. Upon buying my own headset (The Oculus Quest) this was probably one of the first games I invested my money in. I've had it for a long time now since getting my headset in February 2020. I never stops being fun to play. I love the ability to add-on songs like Imagine Dragons and Green Day. I play them more then the OST. The customizablity if the game from the colours to the background is a great feature. It truly is a great game that has changed the way people view VR. 

I do think however, that maybe the Add-ons could be updated. I understand getting song rights may be a hassle and simply not possible. But there are so many new songs around that you could really expand on the musical repertoire of the game. I'd love to see some fresh recent songs to partner beautifully with the already outstanding collection. 

Developers you should be proud of this game.",2020年6月22日05:57,4,Iconic VR Game.

It is fun, it gets you moving, and competing for high scores is really fun. My only complaint is that the core set of songs are songs that you have never heard of. Some are good, some are bad.

It's got me and my boys up and moving around instead of sitting stationary in front of the xbox. And I found that if I switch the controllers in my hands on the lower difficulty levels, I have to reach across my body which is great for my obliques. At the higher difficulty levels the game does that for you. They have incorporated into the game certain songs that are intended to be a workout getting the lower body moving as well.

The walls with its previous graphics gave the players a sense of speed and rhythm, but now that they are removed, the maps lack a sense of speed.

2022-05-24 19:51:56.479170,It’s a really fun game must have for new comers in VR.

2022-05-24 19:53:01.151213,"It's a good fun to play game that anyone can play strait out of the gate. Can get pretty difficult but there is a decent progression of difficulty lvls so you can learn at your pace. good game for getting the blood pumping. Song choice is very limited tho. It's all techno dance stuff. Kinda boring. Keep your hands in front of you cause if they go to your side or somehow to far toward the back of your head the quest loses them and you'll probably miss. I don't know about anybody else but I have horrible tracking issues with the quest. It's constantly losing track of the right controller the most. I've tried everything I could find to fix it. Besides the song choice and tracking is the huge leap from expert to expert+ in difficulty. It's horrible. There needs to be another difficulty level between them to smooth out the progression. But other than my little gripes here it's a decent and fun game anyone can play. But not worth $30 in my opinion. If you can, wait till it comes down to half that price.",2020年6月29日20:57,4,This game will tire you out.
2022-05-24 19:53:01.261927,"As a lover of the good old Dancing Stage games, Best Saber is the modern day equivalent that reminds of just how engaging rhythm games are. The levels are inspiring challenging, so make good use of the practice mode for those tougher levels. The main  improvement I would like to see would be more available pop tracks, whether that's add on or included, though the ones created for the game are very catchy and great tunes. Also, better explanation of the customisable options would be good, as I'm changing the custom colours, I wasn't sure what the colours that I was changing were. That and possibly a longer campaign, but that's assuming that it will end when I reach the last of the three points on the map I have left that are visible. 

Overall, a fantastic game and one I've already invested many hours in.",2020年6月30日05:00,4,Great VR Music Game
2022-05-24 19:53:01.380599,"This is an astonishing game due to the graphics motion and accessibility but it only lost one star for the fact that it only has a limited amount of song unless you wire it to a computer which just, lets be honest here, takes away the special things from the oculus quest and how it’s wireless.

I think if you update it we should get more songs or even better be able to search any song that is on beat saber.

But it is still one of my top five games. Well done 👍",2020年6月6日04:44,4,It’s really great but
2022-05-24 19:53:01.502274,"You can't play your own music and yous are not offering much in the game  , the music you have sucks  let the people choose there own music instead of yous being money hungry charging people to have more song, your game isn't worth the money",2020年7月17日14:44,3,It's not worth the money

The default music maps are smooth and fun to play, and I found Hard mode a good challenge to me as a beginner. Anyone can pick this game up and have fun in the Easy and Normal modes.

I have been waiting for many years for someone to put sound and movement / light together and this is the best of that that I have experienced yet (great job Dev's, you're both fantastic and creative!).

2022-05-24 19:54:38.453555,"In this game you chop cubes to the rythem of music. It doesn't sound like much. I tried the demo and thought it was pointless at first. But after a while I kept playing the demo over and over. Finally I bought the game and started playing. That's when I really noticed where the fun comes from. I've now gotten lost to the beat in songs, without buying any of the music packs. It is worth it when you get immersed in wrecking some expert+ level songs.",2020年6月9日12:34,5,Very immersive
2022-05-24 19:54:38.575093,"Love the gameplay but not a big fan of the music. If you’re not into EDM it gets boring and repetitive pretty quick. None of the DLC attracted me.

Wish the game had built-in custom beatmap support though.",2020年6月15日05:38,3,"Great game, boring music"

2022-05-24 19:54:49.407207,Great game but all depends on the music. Would love it if there were more than ten songs. I am not a huge linkin park or green day fan so this was a waste of money until they allow custom songs or add some non-white boy music.,2020年10月21日12:44,2,More songs

2022-05-24 19:55:00.530691,"This was the first game I got when I bought my quest, and to this day, it is still one of my favorites. The difficulty can range from extremely easy (for beginners) to extremely hard (for veterans of beat saber). This game is almost perfect in every way, as it never gets old and it takes a very long time to complete. This is absolutely worth your money. 5/5",2020年6月8日19:38,5,Absolute CLASSIC!
2022-05-24 19:55:10.792565,"The game itself is amazing and it would have to have a pretty bad update for me to change my 5 stars but on the quest it is a bit laggy and sometimes it will miss for no reason I don't know if this is just my quest but I would like it fixed if possible, if not it is still great and worth playing just don't but a quest if you are going to play competitively with your friends",2020年6月9日04:42,5,Great game but a bit buggy
2022-05-24 19:55:10.963728,"The core mechanic is so incredibly satisfying, the vibration through the controllers when slicing blocks, crossing your sabres or dragging them through walls is fantastic.
The game has a huge amount of gameplay with a significant replay ability factor to go along with it, The core campaign is great for introduction to new mechanics and challenges which then make way for solo play where you chose the song.

Great game for daily activity during Covid",2020年7月17日14:43,5,Incredibly Satisfying Activity

I especially love doing boulevard of broken dreams expert+ on the 170% speed in the practice mode, though I do dislike the sabers’ lengths, being one arms length each, it’s still fun to play, aside from a lot of my swings slicing through the blocks and not registering XD though, that’s all I dislike about the game. I’d love to see custom songs reach the quest though. Thanks for reading ^_^",2020年6月13日05:10,5,Astounding

2022-05-24 19:55:33.191451,This game is undoubtedly a must have for any vr headset. Its unfortunate that you can’t add custom songs but I understand why the devs had to do it. I do have one recommendation though. A modifier that gives you a sort of “last chance” mode if you run out of energy where the song slows down for a bit and you have a small amount of time to gain your energy back before you lose the level. Another idea I have is a sort of song milestone type of thing where you get some sort badge or something for completing a song on expert plus with insta-fail for example. This is though an amazing game and highly recommended for anyone new to vr or vr veterans.,2020年8月10日13:00,4,Must have game for all

2022-05-24 19:57:11.981281,This game is SO much fun to play with friends and family. I have played this game so much that I can complete expert+ levels. This game is so satisfying when you slice through those boxes like they are made of butter. Even my parents play the game. Over all it is a great game and would recommend getting as your first game on the quest.,2020年6月5日14:44,5,Amazing game
2022-05-24 19:57:12.107915,"This game might sound boring if you haven’t played it before. I mean all you do is swing your arms in different directions. But after you play it, it’s a whole different story. This game is amazing! The music is great, the tracking is excellent, the game is very well made, and new content is constantly being added. When your in the game and music is blasting and your hitting every block and your heart is pumping, it’s just an amazing feeling. And if your having any doubts, just try the demo. That’s how I got into the game. And also, the game has a campaign! You don’t just select songs and play. The campaign has a lot of levels that increase in difficulty and is really fun to play. This game is really fun and I recommend it 100 percent. If I could, I would rate it a hundred stars. To the developers, great work and keep adding new content!",2020年6月5日13:05,5,The best game I have on my quest!

It’s very satisfying too.",2020年6月6日02:19,5,"Amazing, Hard, but Amazing"

2022-05-24 19:57:23.213673,The game play is very good but to be honest I like the demo much better than the game itself. I would allow our family to all play and when we each got a high score we could enter in our names and see who was doing the best. This does not allow that. I am not sure why a demo would have things that the full version doesn’t. It would be nice to see exactly what we are getting.,2020年6月11日11:05,3,Not what we expected

I used to look a videos of people playing and wonder, can I do that, or....would I early want to? I just didn’t get the appeal, but I got my quest and it came with a demo level of beat saber. I finished it after some difficulty and immediately bought the full version, bought new cables to try to see if I could somehow get more maps, and in the interim, since that failed for now, I am purchasing a majority of the dlc. If you think you can’t do it or it won’t be fun, I promise you will not only enjoy it, it may become a new addition to your daily exercise routine!",2020年6月6日22:10,5,"I had no clue, now I KNOW"

It runs well 99% of the time, but the only thing that bugs me is that there aren’t custom songs available for the game. It sucks a lot because most of beat sabers best songs are custom. Please devs, do something about this, we will be forever grateful. Other than that the games good, I love it and i don’t regret buying it.",2020年6月19日12:39,4,"Good, but NO CUSTOM SONGS"

BUT tracking is BEST with Native install of beat saber on the quest the quest keeps up with the tracking of expert+ songs even with custom songs. If you are a pro Beat Saber player that plays expert+ songs makes sure u get it NATIVE installed on the quest for perfect tracking.  If you area a streamer use the oculus mixed reality, its painful to setup but it will stream native quest games in mixed reality well.",2020年6月20日17:44,5,Best on the Quest

2022-05-24 19:59:45.534309,But the game doesn't have enough tracks and as I don't own a computer or want to have to to add songs on a modded version I ask why haven't you as a company added a custom song mode so we can just straight port songs to create us a beatmap and let us use our own music and just manage it so it's not going against regulations I love this game it's amazing but the pc version has so many more tracks added and so many longer tracks that are more challenging I'm a quest user I get there is stuff u can't add but I just believe that's a way for u to get away with not adding more tracks for free I got all the add ons and even there just lacking I believe this game will thrive if u just add more songs not just some gimmick game modes sorry for the rant but ur just adding modes to keep people on the game just add the songs and stuff the fans want and then we will all keep playing and actually loving the game for what it was before,2020年6月7日01:02,3,I would give this game a higher rating

2022-05-24 20:00:40.746723,one of the best vr games i have ever played and definitely the best rhythm game i have ever played,2020年7月15日06:21,5,amazing game
2022-05-24 20:00:40.868951,it’s a very nice great success,2020年7月24日10:42,5,very nice
2022-05-24 20:00:40.974281,Awesome,2020年7月29日05:12,5,Awesome
2022-05-24 20:00:51.251840,This is still the best game if you love rythm games.,2020年7月19日23:27,5,Classic
2022-05-24 20:00:51.380494,"The lack of cloud save is especially egregious given the Oculus quest's insanely easy way to factory reset your device. I've owned the quest for a month now and accidentally factory reset twice. The first time I climbed all the way back up the campaign ladder to where I was, but I couldn't bring myself to play those early levels again after the second time. Would be a perfect game if it had cloud save",2020年6月17日11:17,4,"Great game, but no cloud save"
2022-05-24 20:00:51.515135,"Compared to BeatSaber on other platforms, this one feels like the sabres aren’t aiming directly in the direction you’re pointing. You can mess with this in game but it’s a tad bit confusing compared to other platforms but apart from this minor detail it’s a well fleshed out version, which runs great on the Quest!",2020年6月22日03:36,4,Angle
2022-05-24 20:00:51.662739,"For a 30 dollar game, it is amazing. And also, there are so much more than the regular songs. You can buy add-ons, AND use side quest to play custom songs! It is truly amazing.",2020年6月25日02:35,5,A must have.
2022-05-24 20:00:51.807354,Only thing I would say is that it is the only game that dose not work for me when I try to use Bluetooth speakers so friends can hear the game as they watch. Other than that great game definitely recommend.,2020年6月19日07:45,5,It’s a great party game
2022-05-24 20:01:02.116724,I am attached to this game,2020年7月25日08:57,5,Great game
2022-05-24 20:01:02.251387,Im addicted,2020年8月2日13:01,5,Its to good
2022-05-24 20:01:02.378026,"Great game, 10/10 :)",2020年7月25日21:33,5,"My arms are now spaghetti, I love it!"
2022-05-24 20:01:02.500698,Not much to say but... what a blast! My favorite game on VR.,2020年7月17日17:54,5,Great Game!
2022-05-24 20:01:02.630662,"I love the game so much. Its a blast. But the games you get initially with the game are lackluster. The only way to get songs like imagine dragons and songs you know you have to pay more. Plus, its very difficult to get custom songs too. So if they could give you custom songs that you can get on it from the quest that would make this game a million times better. But great game.",2020年6月26日13:03,3,Awesome but some problems
2022-05-24 20:01:12.928262,"I already owned this on PlayStation, but wanted it on quest as well, so that if I were traveling, it would be easier to carry. I use this game as exercise as it makes a great low impact workout. Plus, the quest seems to track better than PlayStation at times.",2020年6月12日08:29,5,Great game for fun workouts.
2022-05-24 20:01:13.072876,This game is reason enough to buy an Oculus quest,2020年7月20日03:01,5,Must have
2022-05-24 20:01:13.208513,"First purchase in quest that costed money and it is amazing but is a major workout, sometimes.",2020年7月11日07:31,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 20:01:13.355121,"I played this for 30 min and not only is it fun but it’s good cardio as well,",2020年10月20日21:41,5,Soooo fun
2022-05-24 20:01:13.497742,"Very physical, but worth the sore joints! I haven't been this physically active since High School!",2020年7月14日03:01,5,Loads of Fun
2022-05-24 20:01:23.808120,"It is awesome, but there should be more purchase able songs... diverse amount of music from gaming culture should be added.  There should be an option to remove vibrations in the controllers so that the gameplay is fully silent.",2020年6月13日13:43,5,Awesome Game!  Great Workout.
2022-05-24 20:01:23.976112,This game is amazing it has loads of songs excellent game.,2020年10月25日04:03,5,Amazing !!!
2022-05-24 20:01:24.087351,"They added a system that changes how loud it is when you hit a note based on how loud the music is, which normally wouldn't be an issue, if it wasn't mixed so horribly! For me it is always way too quiet to the point of i can barly hear it, but others say it is either too quiet or too loud. So please either remove this feature or fix the mixing. The hits are supposed to be loud, in your face, and punky. Other than that it's a good game.",2020年6月19日14:22,2,Dumb addition.
2022-05-24 20:01:24.195224,I absolutely love this game but iv played all the songs.  I would love to see a feature for people on quest who don't have access to a oc to be able to download custome songs like you can on pc!  That would add so many More options!,2020年6月13日11:00,5,More songs
2022-05-24 20:01:24.451279,I’ve had my oculus for a little over a month now and I have to say that Beat Saber is my favorite game. It is fun to listen to your favorite songs and swing to the rhythm of it. And for a challenge try expert or expert+!,2020年6月15日06:11,5,A absolute must have
2022-05-24 20:01:34.709374,It's great to compete with my friends,2020年7月22日10:16,5,Great fun game
2022-05-24 20:01:35.114745,It is the first game I got and it is really fun,2020年7月24日02:11,5,Fun
2022-05-24 20:01:35.232537,Wow where has this been all these years. I missed out for so long..,2020年7月15日18:41,5,Amazing
2022-05-24 20:01:35.338137,"On a scale of 1 to 10 I’d give it an 11! lol
This game is soooo fun it’s addicting!
Beyond awesome! And the level status is pretty much spot on!

Whoever created it is a Genius! Thank you!",2020年7月19日13:22,5,BEAT SABER BEST GAME EVER
2022-05-24 20:01:35.678993,"The one thing holding this back is the lack of content. The game is fundamentally great! The environments, custom modifiers, the responsiveness, everything is so so good! I just wish if had more content. The couple dozen no-name songs make it feel more like a $30 demo than a full game and having to pay for additional songs (only another couple dozen, mostly still no-name tunes) sucks.

This game is only truly worth buying if you were to mod it to allow custom beatmaps.",2020年6月17日08:25,4,Great if...
