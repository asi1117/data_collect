Due to all the extremely positive tests and reviews on YouTube, I ordered my very first VR glasses.The operation is extremely good, especially Air Link via WLAN, no latency, everything responds directly.Now for the big problem, the IPD (interpupillary distance).I see everything blurry, why? Because the maximum IPD is 68mm.So I measured my IPD, it is almost 74mm.I did not know that you have to pay attention to this, you assume that the developers have thought about it and calculated everything, especially such a banality. Only 5-6 milimeters more!Why do you do that ?I found on Reddit and other forums, very many users who have the same problem.What were the developers thinking, please ?Measure your interpupillary distance beforehand, if it is greater than 68mm, the VR is completely unusable for you.I hope with the Quest 3, the problem will be fixed.Now I have to send the VR expensive back from Germany.Thanks for nothing.Best regards.

The Quest 2 requires you to use your real name and photos via a Facebook account to use essentially a video game system.  This is beyond ridiculous.  I do not want to use Facebook.  I tried to create a dummy Facebook account and it suspended my account making me upload pictures of my face.  What the hell!!!  I just want to play some games.  Shame on Facebook.  Shame on Oculus.  Shame on the employees working there.  Shame shame shame.  I’ll be returning this.  This is why Facebook is a garbage company.

I think Facebook did a great thing with this ""new"" release of the quest 2. The headset itself feels quite nice, although the strap is definitely something to work on, it's way too front heavy. It's also extremely uncomfortable using glasses, unfortunately. Even with that said, the Oculus link feature was the only reason I bought this headset; and it's everything I could of asked for. My internet isn't even that good, all it needed was my laptop to be connected by ethernet for a smooth, high quality PCVR experience that I could take ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE! I only had slight lags and stutters, but that's likely just my mediocre hardware. I'm a bit bummed by the comparably smaller control scheme compared to something like the vive.If you really want to have the best experience with this headset though, then don't put away that wallet just yet. At the very least, a new strap would be optimal, and I'd stay away from the first party elite strap. A new face cover might be good for you as well, as the default foam cover isn't the best for everyone.Overall, this headset is a great step in the right direction for vr tech. Although, out of the box, it should be subject to some modifications; which some could call a feature.One more thing, don't worry about the whole Facebook account thing. If you're fine with using whatsapp or Instagram, this shouldn't be a problem either. It's not like Facebook with Oculus is a new thing either, as Facebook has owned Oculus for 7 years now.Edit: after about a month of use, this headset has now become the most annoying piece of tech I own. The one feature I bought this for (Airlink) is straight garbage over half the time, im spending more time trying to fix this failure than I am actually using it. Connection hilariously unstable over ethernet with completely random performance drops. So both an unstable and sometimes unplayable experience that I paid 300 dollars for.

After owning a Rift S that stopped working due to a bad cable, I was looking forward to not having to worry about a faulty cable getting in the way. I was looking forward to playing my favorite games, such as Space Engine, Half-Life Alyx, Pavlov, etc, in a wireless package.Unfortunately, zuckerberg and his minions don't want you to have fun and be happy. They want you to only buy approved, selected, overpriced ""games"" from their Oculus app store. The least they could do is let me have google earth, like with my last Oculus, but no, not even that is available. It would be really great if we could simply install the VR games we want onto this standalone device from our Steam library, but facebook doesn't want you to independently choose what you do with the Oculus Quest 2, they want a monopoly (what the f*** is the 256GB for then??). There is no option for open-source gaming unless you plug the headset into your PC (so why the f*** did I bother buying a headset that is advertised as ""wireless"" and ""without limits?"").I don't know if the relevant powers that be will actually see this review, but just in case, I kindly ask the Lizard Clan to unf*** this device that is, as of now, a waste of money. After seeing the latest testimony from the facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, asserting that facebook doesn't care about their users, I have very little confidence that they will give any consideration to complaints such as mine.Facebook has ruined Oculus, just like Disney has ruined Star Wars. Save your money for a Valve Index instead. Also I hate the antichrist.

My expectations were probably a little too high to be able to just plug the thing into my computer and start playing. It led me through a very linear and invasive data gathering setup with no way to skip or ignore. Why would facebook do this? They're making most of their money on this product collecting your data by linking this product to everything it possibly can. You are paying for a way for facebook to gather your info and make money off of it. You don't like it? Return it like I did. I have a lot of great things to say about the return process. This is the first thing I've ever returned, and I gotta say that it was a great process.Facebook stuff aside, the screen door effect was very noticeable and distracting. I might be a bit spoiled from having a 4k monitor, but it was definitely a large step down from where I would be impressed. The strap it comes with is pretty bad. I couldn't get it on my head right. When I did finally get it in an ok place on my head with the eye spacers just right, there was a GIANT gap where the nose section should meet my face. Everything said and done, I couldn't return the thing fast enough. I owned it maybe 2 hours before I totally lost interest.

This 128GB storage capacity is supposed to replace in full the previous 64GB version while keeping the same amazing price!I must admit this 128GB now suits most newer games which are usually massive in size. This is really an excellent space to store good/new/high quality games. Even giving the option to store/watch more 2D and 3D movies.I myself liked the head strap that comes with it, although I never tried the Elite Strap.I would also recommend getting an anti-scratch silicone ring protector if you wear a glass like me as this should help both: your glasses and the VR lenses from getting scratched. It will let you keep your glasses on while playing games or watching movies.Before you use the headset straight away, it needs a few tweaks here and there to ensure comfortable wear specifically for your head size and comfortable view for your eyes by adjusting both the strap sizing and placement as well as the IPD settings.A VR silicon cover is now included in the box which is a great addition for people with sensitive skin. This also resolves many of the complaints about skin irritation in the previous version.Being a classic PC gamer for many years, I would say VR technology is really something that every gamer should try. Just make sure that you are playing in a safe space and a specialized playing area!The Oculus Quest 2 is a fully standalone VR headset and I may also call it a “gaming monster”, with native built-in games if you don’t have a powerful gaming PC. It also works with steam VR games with no problem if you do have a gaming PC and you can connect them both using Steam link and the Oculus Link desktop app.The headset can have a refresh rate of up to 90Hz for some games, compared to only 72Hz on the previous model which also has a lower resolution. This is a big plus of course.Overall, in my opinion, this is the best VR headset around at this moment which can render up to near 4K resolution at 90hz.

OK So I gave it one star for the fact that VR is cool.It won't get 5 stars nor will I buy another headset from facebook's oculus for the following:-applications are SLOW and freeze all the time no matter how few apps you have open.-Multitasking is limited. Most apps put you all in on their app. There is no desktop and no windows.-Remote desktop is virtual and very slow.-Graphics are not that great. Things close up are fuzzy and pixilated at 1080. VR  is not ready yet.-The keyboards in VR are interrupted by your pointer finger acting like a mouse randomly clicking things when you type.-The headset sucks at mapping my environment. Change one thing and suddenly I have to remap my environment instead of gaming. When you try to remap it... it remembers you placed a guardian or barrier then stops the setup. Then it forgets and makes you do setup. This keeps looping until you are pissed and restart the system.-There is no place to plug in headphones. Everyone has to listen to your music.-I constantly have to go to windows settings because the apps take over my computer speaker... oddly enough the device cannot usb-c connect or air connect but it can VR desktop and turn off my sound even when I turn off the headset.-The headset randomly glitches the environment making you seasick outside of apps-They are like apple trying to restrict all apps or on the Facebook system only. However, then all your friends with other devices are playing games outside of oculus closed system. They need to have a desktop home screen with windows not this browser internet only nonsense. I will not buy another one of these. There is too much to fix! They ruined VR for me. Especially as someone who develops games in UE4

This is my first and only VR experience.  With that said, in just the first few minutes, during the setup and updating process, my mouth was agape.  The tutorial had me smiling in wonder at the feeling of immersion.  The apps available natively to the Quest 2 are varied and fun, if not cheap, but there are demos and free games out there.  We like is so much, we are probably buying a second in the near future.However, my favorite piece of this requires use of a decent PC and fast Wi-Fi: Oculus AirLink, currently in Beta, is a cable free connection to the Oculus program on your computer that allows use of Oculus Rift and Steam VR games.  These are generally games that need the extra processing power of a real GPU, and offer better graphics and more complex environments than the Quest alone can provide.  Google Earth VR, a free app that isn't on the Quest natively is, for me, worth the price of admission on its own.  Being able to walk among the skyscrapers of NYC, or play Gojira in Tokyo is awe inspiring.A couple of minor cons:  Battery life is poor.  During our first days, when we were using it especially heavily, I had a battery pack and USB-C cable connected to the Quest that we'd swap into pockets to add play time.  They make improved head-strap setups that include provisions for holding a battery.About that strap, some in my family complained about it, so we may be shopping for an upgrade.  I can live with it, however.In low light, the guardian, the virtual barrier that is set to keep you from running into walls, can flake out, dropping you out of the game.And lastly, a big con for some folks: This requires an active, real, Facebook account.  Deactivating your account deactivates your Quest.  Deleting you account deletes, permanently, all of your purchased apps, with no refund.  There are lots of reports regarding problems with folks using fake names, secondary accounts, other folk's accounts, etc.  When there are problems, Facebook will delete or lock accounts, and render your Quest a brick.  Customer service is reportedly horrendous when trying to fix these problems.  My advice would be to use your real account, don't fudge around, and you should be fine.  Yes, they are tracking you, Yes they are subsidizing the prices of these thing by commodifying your data.  However, unless you are already complete social media hermit, getting in bed a little deeper isn't going to alter your data footprint in any significant way.  If you are here shopping on Amazon with a cellphone in your hand or pocket, worrying about Facebook is sort of pointless.TL;DR - GET ONE.  It's a great value within the reach of many people.  You can have a ton of fun without a PC, and even more with one.

Got mine delivered really fast. I was able to set up everything with no problem and with ease. Truly a crazy experience to be in a virtual world--you actually forget that what you see isn't actually real. I found myself oftentimes carefully not bumping into the i.e. furniture in the virtual world when it was just space and nothingness outside of it. One of the coolest features I am stumped about is that if you leave a certain area that you have previously marked, the headset has a grayscale camera that reveals what's in front of you. This is extremely useful for safety measures as it alerts you if you stray too far from your marked territory. Absolutely love it! Also, the headset lasts for about ~2 hours before you need to recharge if you're playing games nonstop.Edit: For those who wear glasses, I highly recommend to buy VR Wave prescription lenses with the headset. For me personally, it's been huge inconvenience trying to remove the headset and putting it back on until I made the investment and bought the lenses. It'll definitely help with having fun in VR without having to adjust your headset frequently.

VR has finally started coming of age.  I am very much enjoying this device but I'm also very annoyed at having to have a Facebook account.  I'm also not very fond of the way the device daisy-chains to connect to Steam, and I've had problems across the two VR systems.  There is a learning curve here for sure.  That said, this is a whole lot of fun.UPDATE:  lots of usage later I have discovered that this device is perfect for running a real-life emulation of what gaming was like in the early 90s.Conflicts and drivers and incompatibilities and half-ready features and buggy, homebuilt games.  Oh my.  I am not sure what the timeplayed to timefixing ratio might be with this thing, but I have to admit that my 'fun' threshold has been crossed.Here are some of the things you will learn about when you get one of these, to save you some time on Google:  Oculus native vr, Oculus Link VR, Steam VR (always crashes eventually), Sidequest, Oculus developer account, VorpX, Virtual Desktop, games that support 90hz and games that do not, trying to reclaim your Steam titles from the Oculus, accidentally buying the native, link, AND steam versions of an app.  The list goes on and on.  Also, to me, anything that makes me take the headset off and go back to my pc is a strike against.  Oculus link will fail at least 30% of the time.Also, if you want to attempt a wireless connection to the device you have to have a very specific network setup for it to even almost work.  You must have your PC connected to the router by CABLE so that the only wireless connection is from the mask to the router.*** I accomplished this by hanging an extra access point from my Ethernet connection, bridged to my WiFi.  Connecting directly to the private AP worked better in Link, almost perfectly in Virtual Desktop, but, Sidequest stopped working because you can't change the IP in there-- anyway, nothing is easy on this thing.I'm going to file this under ""really cool and almost works novelty"" and go back to gaming on my 3080/240hz modern setup.  I'll strap the two ancient low-resolution, low-performance monitors to my face with the snorkling mask as an experiment but I've given up on any notion of actually playing any of these titles.  Most of the time you end up taking your mask on and off to troubleshoot things and never progress in the games, unless you like jaggies and blurriness, freezes and skipped frames.Also, if you plan on getting the most out of this VR thing you need to have a VERY large, empty space to play in- you can choose to play seated and stationary in some games, but you still may end up knocking stuff off of your desk.  Be careful.Which brings me to the METAVERSE.  OK, I understand what Zuck is going for.  Here are some problems that will put that idea in the ground:  * Headaches and nausea for everyone thanks to the low quality graphics, if you wear glasses you will have problems.  *ALL of the ""meta"" apps are creepy and featureless works in progress.  I've never had any desire to either float around as a noseless cartoon head with three fingered hands or play a hyper-realistic sex robot.  *The user community is, by definition, very very young and very very spoiled.  This is a rich kid's toy (or a toy for a retiree with too much time on his hands.)  It takes a beefy computer to make this work.  Not cheap. *Mandatory Facebook integration: I don't expect this to last. (BTW, anyone who thinks that Zuck didn't know that ""Meta"" means ""Death"" really needs some critical-thinking skill training.)  There is something creepy going on here.So the ""metaverse"" will be populated solely by people with money and time and huge empty play spaces who enjoy playing ping-pong with strangers on the death network.  This is not an idea destined for popular acceptance.  Don't invest in it.  This is not ready for prime time yet, and it appears that Facebook is intent on developing the technology solely to enslave people with it.  This thing COULD be fun, but it ain't there yet.

Having owned an HTC Vive for several years, I was interested in trying out what is supposedly the ""next generation"" of VR headsets.  I especially liked the idea that it was smaller and more portable and did not need extra boundary sensors and things.  But right off the bat, the system was annoying and user un-friendly.  For starters, you can't fully-install or run the software  unless you give GPS location information to Facebook.  This is completely unnecessary.  Facebook does not need to know my GPS location in order to enable me to pair the device with my mobile phone (that was another unknown requirement: you have to install a special app on your phone to continue configuration of the device. Hardly plug-and-play, and if you don't give Occulus permission to know your location, it will give you ambiguous messages indicating something is wrong when they know exactly what's wrong: they won't allow you to complete the installation unless you give them unnecessary personal information.  That's inappropriate.)  The Rift has some neat features like a convenient boundary and object detection system, but its processing is just too slow to make VR enjoyable.  Even rudimentary games just do not play well.Ok, fine, after all that mess I fire the system up and it immediately wants to up-sell me on a bunch of extra software that I already have purchased on Steam.  The system is SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than other VR headsets years older.  Playing common games like Rec Room or Pokerstars VR result in laggy, unplayable gameplay.  It's really horrible.  I'm very disappointed in this product.  Will not be purchasing any more Occulus products.

I was more than excited to get the new Oculus Quest 2 based on all of the stellar reviews. But I was extremely disappointed with the low quality of the display for a product that's priced this high.It's extremely blurry and not even remotely clear unless you're staring directly at a single spot on the screen. If you even look a little bit left or right then it becomes even more distorted. You're watching videos recorded in 8K that have the look of a 360p equivalent based on what you're actually seeing in front of your eyes.It's clear that the technology has not caught up yet in order to provide a decent VR experience. I feel that they're rushing to sell these standalone units that aren't tethered to PCs, because most people don't have higher end PCs anymore. At least not anywhere close to what you'd need to run it at a decent enough refresh rate or resolution. It's just not powerful enough to run without some decent hardware, which probably run several grand. I feel it's basically like having a smartphone with goggles attached to it.The advances in the actual interaction in the VR world are quite incredible. The controllers and interface are very impressive, which allow you to interact with objects even with your bare hands. However, it's all a moot point if the display quality makes the experience unusable in the first place.I had high hopes of having a better experience based on the reviews that you see everywhere online and on YouTube. It fell far short of my expectations, yet everywhere you look reviewers and companies are raving about it. But I guess if you have a multi-billion dollar company that controls social media, then you're bound to have biased ""opinions"" work out in your favor.Do yourself a major favor and try out someone else's before making the purchase. If you're anything like me, then you just might be completely underwhelmed with this newest VR experience by Oculus.

The kiddo saved up FOREVER to buy these VR goggles. It was all he could talk about and drove us crazy. He finally had enough, ordered them with expedited shipping, and planted by the door the day they were scheduled to arrive. Exactly 2 days after he got them, he said they kept going to a gray screen, showing some dots, then wouldn't power on until he did a hard restart. We Googled the headset to see if we could resolve the issue. This is a KNOWN problem dating back to their original release and no corrections have been made. Literally thousands of blogs, reviews, and forums address this. I don't blame the seller because they were awesome and very responsive to our refund request after two weeks of trying to figure out a solution. Do your research. Some are just fine with no problems, and then there are those that make a 12 year old question how a manufacturer can continue to sell an item with known issues.

I specifically bought the Quest 2 to try out Supernatural, absolutely the best purchase all year!I'm a 50 something morbidly obese woman who struggles with mobility issues so I use my Quest 2 while seated in a swiveling office chair (I recommend no arms...) Yes Beat Saber is fun and Wander allows me to explore the globe from home but Supernatural is LIFE CHANGING.Just in 2 months of using the Supernatural app to workout (flow and now BOXING!) I am seeing many physical improvements! My body is toning up, I'm developing obvious new muscles in my arms, back, neck, belly and LEGS - all while seated from a chair! I'm walking easier, my legs and back hurt less and I have more energy. I'm stunned my calves and thighs are getting stronger, my husband pointed out he sees me using my legs to pivot the chair to follow portals and I do lean n lunge with the  triangles, too.The Supernatural FB community is awesome too. I've met some really cool new online friends from around the country.I highly recommend the Q2 though unless you plan to download a ton of movies you really only need the 128 version. 2 months in and I realize there's no way I will fill the 256 unless I record many hours of my Supernatural workouts lolGet the Quest 2, Get Supernatural and JOIN US! You'll be glad you did!

Oculus Quest 2 is really great if your intention is just to play Beat Saber all day. But the reality is that practically speaking, it's a lower resolution and lower tier VR experience. Facebook's own Horizon Workspaces doesn't work very well on the Quest 2, because it has low resolution and trying to focus your eyes on your computer screen in VR Is not very fun. Immersed (another VR workspace app) is okay, and low enough latency for decent work in VR but the resolution of the Quest 2 will still bite you.Apps like YouTube VR are okay, because the screen is practically at the optimized FOV convergence point. But the reality is that the display is so low resolution that 360 videos kinda don't look great on the display anyway. It's really a shame.A different head strap is mandatory. This hurts a TON after wearing it for any extended period of time. Impressively bad head strap. Will leave red marks on your face.Finally, the biggest thing I haven't mentioned is that the device itself runs Android, and it's a pretty low powered android device. Unfortunately, this means that apps like YouTube VR can lag and stutter, which really sucks more in VR than any other device. In VR, lag and stuttering means that your view suddenly freezes, which immediately creates motion sickness. Not great.But it's an okay first experience for VR. It's a great Beat Saber machine. For anything other than Beat Saber, you're probably better off waiting for the Quest 3 or getting a different VR headset with higher resolution displays and better FOV lenses.

I purchased this product because I thought using some of the exercise games would be a good way of getting myself off of the couch. My first disappointment was learning that I had to create a Facebook account in order to use this device.  I don't use Facebook because they've been so lax with their users personal data.  And, given all of the media attention they've gotten regarding how their own research shows how harmful one of its platforms is to young girls, that they held onto, gives me no faith that they want to protect us or our data.  I decided that I would create an account and only use it when I use the Oculus.  This is where my second disappointment came about. I went through the process of creating an account and once I was done I got a message stating that my account did not meet community standards. What?!! I was asked to upload a picture of myself so that they could verify I'm really who I said I was, which I did (are they using facial recognition?).  I got this final message, ""We received your informationIf we still find that your account didn't follow our Community Standards, it will remain disabled.We're always looking out for the security of people on Facebook, so until then you can't use your account"".I doubt they're looking out for my security or yours.  If my account is still disabled after a couple of days I'll send the $399 device back and get my exercise the old fashion way.  Until then, the Oculus is nothing more than a lead weight.

Can't say if the product was any good, as once I got it, I discovered (as part of the install process) that you absolutely HAD to have a Facebook account to even install the headset, and, link it to your Facebook account!  Spent some time chatting with their helpdesk who said there was NO way around that...so returned the item.  I refuse to make a FB  account just to use a headset, and certainly don't need Facebook targeting me with ads based on what I play on it.

 Oh my gosh, where do I start? First of all, buy the battery back up as you will definitely drain the battery. The visor when fully charged lasts about 2 hours and it just won't be enough time, especially if you are sharing.Oculus Quest 2 has great graphics and provides out of this world artistically rendered experiences in a  computer-simulated environment where you aren’t just a passive participant, but a visitor engaging with other visitors. [There is a blocking feature as well if you prefer to tune out other people].With the Oculus Quest 2 headset, you become immersed in incredible 3D worlds, creating a major shift your reality. Since the world around you turns every time you move your head, you feel like you’re “in the game” mentally and physically. In other words, you feel like you’re part of another universe. In some of the games you actually get the sensation of motion as if you are on a ride or flying through the air.Oculus Quest 2 is more than just entertainment though, you can learn how to become a DJ or a photographer, teleport almost anywhere in the world, or walk around the International Space Station. Oculus Quest 2 lets you explore new worlds and attempt new experiences that were previously out of reach. It even has great exercise apps. So while games are definitely the major plus of Oculus Quest 2, there are plenty of other applications to discover. I continue to discover more daily. Such as watching movies on a big screen TV in a dream home. You have to experience it to believe it, so buy it! It's amazing and so much fun. Enjoy!Additional tip: Make sure you adjust the lenses for your face size. It will enhance the clarity of the picture.

Causes eye strain. No amount of adjusting makes this feel comfortable. I purchased the Elite head strap. It's like having a brick tied to your face. It's like inviting people over to a party, but then you hide in the bathroom, and you can then go 'ah and ooh' and tell them how cool it is. And, they wait for you to come out eventually. When you pull it off your face, you're slimy and gross. Yey, motions sickness, that what I wanted.  My curiosity was satisfied after one demo. Packed it up and sent it back. Did I mention YOU MUST GET FACEBOOK? There's no workaround. You must have or create a Facebook account.

I really wanted to use this.  I had a Facebook account years ago and didn't like it, so I deactivated it.  My choice.  Now, I could only go under that account, which it said was now disabled.  I can't create a new one.  Every avenue they gave to try to fix it did not work.  It's impossible to actually talk to someone there.  So I can't use this and have to return it.  Why in the world you need to link it to a social platform, I have no idea.  Especially when that platform has such poor customer support.  Guess I'll just have to wait to see what the next Sony VR upgrade will be.

When I try to create an oculus account it requires you to log into Facebook or create a Facebook account.  When I log into my Facebook login through the oculus quest app it just spin and spins and never loads to lets you pair. So we tried my Wife's Facebook account on her iPhone since it didn't work on my Samsung.  Same thing its just stuck on loading.  Then I go to the oculus website and try to create an account with a new Facebook account that I just created.  Same thing just loads loads loads.  2 different phones 2 different browsers on my pc.  clear history per support still no go.I would advise staying away from this VR that requires you to sign into or create a Facebook account just to use it when you can't even set it up.  Horrible experience having to jump through Facebook hoops just to get the VR experience.  Just wait for more reliable VR from Play station, Xbox, Gaming on PC's.  Facebook is the worst.

I took this helmet as my first. I really liked himOf the merits, very good picture quality (no pixels visible)Games can be run directly on the helmet itself, it's just like a console on your head! Moreover, the games look pretty nice, although some games look better on pcExcellent tracking of controllers I have never had such a thing that he lost controllersHand tracking is also present, but it works mediocre enough. It needs excellent lighting and does not cover each other's hands. In general, a cool feature, but for now it needs some work.Well, it's also worth noting that the headset itself has an excellent sound! I thought that he would be pretty mediocre on it, and therefore decided to take headphones as well. Headphones are certainly not bad, but I still prefer the sound from the helmet itself so as not to wear anything extraI also want to note the controllers themselves, the batteries that are preinstalled at the bottom can last a charge for about a month, and also from time to time I can hit the wall and the controllers are quite strong (unlike my fingers)Well, the price is $ 300Of the minuses Once, I accidentally hit the helmet with the controller and the sound in one of the headphones on the helmet disappeared, but then I accidentally hit it again and it came back ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯

I'm very impressed with this headset! I wrestled with whether to pay $100 more for double the storage capacity, but after perusing apps in the Oculus store and averaging app sizes, I determined there was too little value in that. Down the road, if I get REALLY into VR in general, I might wind up regretting that decision, but I honestly think that would be the only thing I'd regret about this device.Oculus was experiencing some kind of server issue that prevented me from completing registration and setup right away, so it was about 4 hours after I unboxed it that I was able to use it. And boy, was I blown away! I still have a VR headset that requires a phone be stuck in it, but I haven't used it in a while for just that reason. This one, of course, doesn't need that, and the resolution is really, really good. Your IPD (Inter-pupillary distance), or the distance between your eyes, can be accommodated by selecting from 3 different widths. I read one review that said the maximum is 68mm, but their IPD was 72. In that case, the image will appear blurry. For that reason, I suggest checking your IPD before you purchase.What's in the box is simple, the headset, two controllers (with batteries), a spacer for those who wear glasses and a silicone piece that makes it comfortable to wear against your face. It's very well balanced and doesn't feel heavy to me, but there are optional head straps you can get if you find it too front-heavy. I also like the passthrough feature that lets you see your real-world environment if/when you need to.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and immersiveness of the sound, but I will probably get some ear buds soon so I can get a fuller volume level (I usually have the volume on about 6-7). But it sounds great. The 'Home' environment, which is set up like a house or apartment, is really cool, and there are several different designs available.I found the battery life, stated as about two hours, to be pretty accurate, but I bought a 10-foot USB cable so that I could have it plugged in and playing while it's charging (yes, you can use it fully while it's charging). There is a head strap available with a place for an optional battery to extend use time without worrying about a cable, but that doesn't seem necessary to me, at least not at this point. I just got done using it, and I was in VR for about 3 1/2 hours, and battery life was still 82%. So far, I have used it for probably 20 hours total since I've had it, and the controller batteries are still at 100%. I'm sure that depends on what you're doing, though.I have watched a couple of movies, and with the ability to have a curved screen (or flat if you prefer) that views even larger than my 60"" TV, it's just amazing. I've also played a few games, watched some videos of dancers, concerts, and awesome, immersive tours of places like Switzerland, Italy, the Matterhorn, Great Lakes, under-sea stuff and so many more. All of it has been awesome. And so far, I have found enough good, free content that I haven't gotten around to purchasing anything yet!Another effective feature is the voice control. You can do almost anything using voice commands, including powering the device off. I haven't explored that feature too deeply yet, but I have started and stopped apps and games, checked local time and weather and performed several other functions just by telling it what I want. You just double-press the 'Oculus' button to get it to listen for voice commandsOne complaint I know many will have, is that setting up the device REQUIRES a Facebook account. BUT, you can set it so that your FB profile info, including your profile name, will not be revealed in VR if you happen to do some multi-person thing, and neither is your Oculus username revealed to your FB contacts, so that doesn't bother me at all. The only thing I wish, and this is so minor it's really almost petty, but I do wish it came in black. That isn't even worth deducting stars over. Overall, I just love it, and I highly recommend it!

I originally ordered the 64gb but was cancelled due to the transition to 128gb. The storage obviously wasn’t the reason that I wanted to “upgrade” to the Quest 2, it was really for the supposedly lighter weight.  I was disappointed to find out that the weight for both Quest and Quest 2 units are the same. The published weights for both headsets are with their respective straps attached. Of course, the unit with the cloth strap would come out lighter. I discovered this by having both attached to a Beswin Halo strap and both units came in at 731 grams to my surprise. All the YT reviews didn’t bother to check I guess.If it wasn’t for the higher storage, I would have returned this. The higher resolution, and better processor eases the disappointment as well. I would have been ok using the original for a bit longer but might as well enjoy the newest version, even if it is the same weight. The halo strap helps with that a bunch.

I bought this for video games, I have since been blown away by what I have found to be freely available.I have tried around 150 apps/games/experiences. I have only paid for about 8 of them. I learned how to make music tracks in Virtuoso, I took a tour of Ann Frank's house, I learned how it felt to lose your eye sight and experience your surroundings through sound, I have seen countless documentaries (which is a whole new experience since you are there in the world), I got to fly through the International Space Station, I have fought as a gladiator against man and beast, I have fired up my last shot against hordes of zombies before resorting to baseball bats as the adrenaline sores, I have spent many hours exercising in a variety of games, but one of my favorite is Moon Rider (a free VR web browser title)(it's a rhythm game that can be played with light sabers or by punching the beats), and I have also attended concerts and enjoyed events while still being able to be my normal introverted self.My computer is not at all capable of working with VR, so that sucks, but the amount of stuff the Quest 2 can do stand alone is insanely impressive!There is so much here, it is like buying yourself a second life. I highly recommend reading up ahead of time on a site such as UploadVr. They have great introductory stories hidden away on that site specifically to prepare you and educate you on the Quest 2.My 65 year old mother even bought one, primarily for indoor exercise, but she also enjoys the travel apps which is as close to going somewhere as you can get without going there. Personally I enjoy the free Virtual Traveller, but I think my mother uses a pay app.If you are on the fence about this, stop right now and just buy it.The only caveat to this is that you do need enough well lit space that you can swing your arms about in a circle.I very quickly made more and more and more room in my living room. Now with the holidays I new there would be trouble. I punched a Christmas ball off the tree yesterday whole in a demo fight in an amazing boxing game called The Fight. I still haven't found that ball. It was a good solid left hook! I've also punched the ceiling while jumping and grabbing for a frisbee in the free zero g space sports game that plays like a cross between Ender's Game and Tron. In the gladiator game Gladius I ended up punching the handle off my decorative display cabinet. I cut my hand up on that one. The point here is you need space. Even when you try not to move, you move! There is a digital barrier that you start to see if you get too close to the edge, but in the heat of the moment it's not always enough.

Pros:- Fairly Immersive.- Amazing experiences.- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.Cons:- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.IMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.I have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.Seeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.Be considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.

I was not impressed with the quality of VR apps and games available right now.  Perhaps in the future VR will be improved to the point where it lives up to the hype.  The roller coaster and spacewalk apps were really good, but after that, I couldn't find any other apps or games that were impressive enough to justify the cost of the headset and accessories.  The accessories are another thing.  In order to use it, I needed to buy special headphones made especially for Oculus, a head strap that actually worked, an aftermarket face mask to keep out the light, and custom lenses as it is next to impossible to use it with eyeglasses.  The $300.00 toy quickly became a $500.00 mistake.  Thanks to Amazon's exceptional return policy I was able to send it all back for free with my Prime benefits.  From what I experienced I think it will be a few more years before VR is truly ready for mainstream use.

I understand why they added the new face covers. The material is BAAAAD. Don't get me wrong, it's a great headset. Stronger than the Quest 1, cheaper and lighter. HOWEVER, the build quality is not as great as the Quest 1. They're kind of going the Quantity over Quality route.I've owned the Quest 1, HP Reverb G2, and Valve Index. Unfortunately, I had to downscale so I sold my index and got a Quest 2. This is how I look at it.First off, the face cover... it feels like cheap memory foam they pulled out of a car's seats. Within 5 seconds, my face felt like it did on the Quest 1 in an hour long gaming session. The new covers fix that, but man, I never thought I'd miss the old cover so much. The old ones honestly felt decent. Not too premium, not too rough. It honestly felt like I was rubbing a fine sponge on my face, first time using this thing.The controllers also look worse. They feel the same as the older ones, but they look like they were put together in a rush. On the older controllers, there were barely any noticeable gaps in the plastic, but they are SO obvious here. EDIT : New note; Tracking somehow seems worse... I'd say 3/4 times I use the headset, my Tracking is lost while I'm playing in a pretty well lit and detailed room. The Tracking of the controllers also seems worse. Functionally, it is the same. But Tracking on the Quest 1 definitely felt much smoother.The head strap is part downgrade/part neutral. I find it good that you can upgrade them, but we're talking about the base straps. The Quest 2 straps pinch your hair, if you've just recently cut them and they also chew on your ears. Of this whole experience I've had with the Quest 2, it's been my ears that have been the most annoyed. Audio is also lopsides, with my left hearing more than right. I'm gonna assume this can be resolved with some kind of RMA, but I'm fine with this.The software somehow also feels like a downgrade (or over complication and under complication). In the older versions (Quest 1 versions), you could find most things on one tab and basic functions were in submenus. Everything is all over the place now, and settings is placed in the library like an app... that's just weird. Also, the controllers... they represent where your fingers are a lot less than the older ones. It's a small detail, but it got me so immersed in the Quest 1. It doesn't sit well with me, but it's a minor problem.Lastly, IPD adjustment... I guess it's not that big of a deal, but I'd have preferred a 'by the millimeter' system. It does its job though.As for pros of this headset, there's a lot...1. It's a cheap entry into VR and you won't even need a PC.2. Oculus Software is usually pretty clean (I don't like how it changed so much, but I'll get used to it.)3. You can play PCVR with it.4. It generally improved on its predecessor, and at a lower cost.5. You can upgrade comfort.Would I recommend it? If you're willing to ignore facebook being a requirement, yeah. It's still a versatile headset, regardless of it's downsides.

This renders the Quest 2 useless & it’s disappointing & frustrating for the main Christmas gift to stop working in less than a week.

I was unable to register this because it requires a facebook account and mine was hacked a few months ago. The instructions specifically mention not making a new account. I reached out to oculus support who filed a ticket. It has been 30 days now and only a week ago did facebook contact me but no reply from facebook since I sent in my documentation proving it is my account. so beware if your facebook is hacked it might take longer than the return window to fix the issue. Perhaps wait to buy it until extended return window starts for the holidays. I am hoping it will eventually be fixed.2nd star was because it does seem REALLY cool, the part I could do until i had to register it, it is comfortable and looks nice, but I havent been able to use it.

The Quest 2 device itself is enjoyable, for the handful of games we’ve tried – but the Oculus customer support is horrible!Trying to get information and clarification has been unnecessarily frustrating.Pain Point #1 – Lack of documentation.  They don’t supply standard downloadable user guides… with a Table of Contents and Index.  I have to Google every topic to get information from a YouTube channel in order to figure out what searches to even do on the Oculus site… and then the information is incomplete, or requires a chat.Pain Point#2 – The chat support personnel obviously don’t have access to full documentation either.  They seem to only be able to parrot the basic information on the site.This is not at all a user friendly device.  Initially, I was planning to get a few more headsets, after I figured out how to use the unit.... that definitely won't be happening now.You also have to setup a Facebook Account, obviously that's just to inflate the number of uses they can claim to have.

I love it!  I am 62 years old and decided to buy it, not for the games but for “mind travel”.  Although I have traveled alot I know there are places I will never make it to because of covid and world events and I still want to see them.  The software “Wander” takes me to these places.  It has been pure happiness for me to feel like I an standing looking at The pyramids in Egypt,  the Lost city of Petra in Jordan and others.  I was also able to relive being at my favorite fountains at the Villa d’Este in Rome Italy, I even drank wine while doing so.  My friend who is 20 years younger bought it for staying in shape with the fitness “games”.  She gets a good workout!  I bought a couple also to do likewise.  They are fun but there is a learning period if this is new tech for you as it is for me but don’ give up!  I love my Oculus! I haven’t figured out how to save my favorite videos yet but I will.

I was very excited to get and try out the VR set. It is okay. I can think of better ways to spend 400 dollars and get more enjoyment out of it. Overall I liked the product but there are few details that are very annoying. Like adjusting the headset bands every time because they don't seem to stay in the desired position. The vr headset it self is heavy so after a while it makes your head hurt, and hence why the readjusting of the headset gets annoying. The rubber protectant they gave me, did not fit correctly so it kept moving and intervening with the VR experience. Sound was pretty good as far as loudness, quality as average as you can get for those miniature speakers so no surprise there. I was a little disappointed with the video quality display. For the tutorials the quality of the display is pretty crisp. But if I watched a YouTube video or movie quality was definitely degraded, Pixelated at times. Not sure if it's a limitation of the headset resolution or quality of video at time of recording.As an adult, would not buy again.If I was a kid I can see how all the above mentioned wouldn't matter and would certainly keep me entertained.

My PC is new and more then powerful enough, everything is updated.1/5 time the quest will just decide it’s not going to link up… cable or not..I bought Virtual desktop and it worked, but now the quest won’t pair with steam VR …It’s always somthing.. troubleshooting .. re starts, re boots, instal uninstall etc.. the thing is a pain in the butt…But makes since being Face book…

I bought one of these in February of 2021. The left controller went bad after about two weeks of intermittent use, maybe 2-3 hours per day of use. Changed the batteries, same issue. Got a refund.Decided to try it again in September because it has some cute ideas - especially the movie theater settings you get with youtube or prime video. Maybe I just got a dud that one time?After about eight hours of use in total over the course of one week, I start it up to find out it has fans going absolutely nuts, and it gives me this window on startup that says it's overheating and needs to be removed for safety reasons while it shuts itself off. Unusable after a week??Safe to assume any replacements will also screw up in some form or another after a very brief stretch of time.

I am a CV1 owner (Original Oculus Rift), I love my Rift...and will not part with it. I now have the best of both Oculus worlds. That said, the Quest 2 is a stellar piece of engineering with unbelievable software support from Facebook. I was amazed with all the entertainment available to the Quest 2 that is not available to the PC based Rift. Now I am going to list the accessories I bought that will bring this miraculous piece of technology to a stellar level. You can thank me later. Everything can be bought right here on Amazon.1) The Bobo MR2 pro Head strap with battery (Purchase an extra battery for unlimited playtime $29) $59.992)The Odio one headphones (same specs as the $99 Logitech headphones endorsed by Oculus) I purchased for $19 used (new $34) incredible sound.3) The Aukeer 3.5mm Audio Cable $6.99 (Short audio cable for Headphones),4) A MOBOREST 1/4'' (6.35mm) Audio cable adapter $6.995)  If you intend to use for PCVR, the Syntech Link Cable 16 FT ($21.89)These accessories will turn your Quest 2 into a VR Beast. Purchase the above for less than the pro elite strap with battery from Oculus (not including the link cable). There is no comparison with the quality and value of the above items as opposed to the Oculus product.The Oculus Quest 2 as a modern VR competitor and console has no peer.

So, Oculus Quest 2 requires Facebook account. I never had one so I created it just to use this device. And a hour later my account got banned for allegedly violating something. I used my real name, email and date of birth, and didn't use it for anything except setting up my oculus. I didn't finish connecting it to PC though, and now I can't login into Oculus Link app.Now in order to recover my Facebook account they ask me for my phone and photo. How does my photo helps you confirm that is my account, if account is completely empty? And they say that they can and will use your phone in whatever way they can, you can't opt out of that. This is more than I intended to give them.Whatever, I did fill the form, provided whatever data they ask. My account is not yet unlocked, so I can't use the device I paid for. I guess I don't really own it.TL;DR If you don't have an active Facebook account, don't buy this device. If you think you can just create one, you might get the same issues I have and end up having a useless brick.

I'm coming from a samsung gear VR, so I have a little experience with VR in general.  While the quest 2 is way more powerful with its hardware and 6 degrees of movement, it REALLY lacks in the comfort / usability department in my opinion.My old gear vr had a manual focus dial that you could adjust on the fly, and once you did worked really well considering.  The quest doesn't have this, all it has are three different width positions to set the lenses to.  The type of lenses used have a very small sweet spot for clarity, so if your not set correctly with one of those 3 positions, too bad, beause thats it.  Thats the only adjustment you have with the lenses.If you wear glasses, your about to have a bad time.  The face piece is very narrow width wise, so even using the added adapter for glasses use, it was literally almost like I was forcing my glasses through the unit.  I don't have extra large frames or anything like that either, just standard stuff.  I have contacts, but that just seems like a bad design.  I don't want to switch from my glasses to contacts JUST to use my headset.  It IS possible to purchase prescription lenses for the quest 2, but thats just another added expense.Theres also noticeable light bleed at the nose area with the headset on.The software is fine, works really well for the little time I used it.  Unfortunately the hardware issues with the lenses were a no go for me, and I ended up returning it.

This a fun toy to view videos attend concerts, Billie Eilish was very cool and I’m sure play games. The problem is it’s not well balanced, it becomes very uncomfortable after a short period of time. And, it gets hot! You will constantly be adjusting the headset. Now they supply a silicone covering for the foam around the facile part that goes against your face. It makes your face sweat and slides down even when you have adjusted the Quest to your head and face. There isn’t any circulation and it also sometimes fogs up the lenses. So, I purchased the Elite strap which adds more weight, but is supposed to stabilize the headset. Meh!Really what they need to do is reduce the weight of the product. So much weight up front makes the headset uncomfortable after a short period of time. Someone suggested to purchase the Elite Strap with extra battery pack on the back. This is good if you want to extend gaming time, but adds more weight to the headset. Do I really want to add more weight to an already heavy headset? I don’t think so. Again it’s an ingenious wireless gaming product/toy I hope in the future they figure out how to reduce the weight by miniaturizing the contents of the headset. I gave 3 stars because it’s amazing technology, however it’s not perfect by an stretch. Game on!

Honestly, this is a really fun device to play with. Unfortunately, my eyes don't match the ipd (Inter Pupillary Distance). Because of this, all I see is nothing but a blurry screen through the adjustable lenses. Inter Pupillary Distance means the distance between both your eyes. By the looks of it, I'm between 70-72. If your ipd is between 58-68, I highly recommend giving the headset a try. If it's over 70, stay away from it. Really tragic too. I actually did have fun with this device. But there's no point in keeping it if I can't see through it properly. Hopefully in the future, if Oculus makes an Oculus quest 2 pro, or a new headset, they increase the ipd so I can actually use it properly.

Trying to not be such a couch potato in the middle of winter is difficult for me. I needed something to get my off my keester and moving around. Came across an Oculus ad and figured I’d give it a shot not knowing if it would do the trick but it was worth a try.It definitely worked. I’m not going crazy with it but it’s definitely got me up and moving around a little bit more than I was with the option to increase my activity level. I’ve been playing Beat Saber just to get my body in motion. There are other options available that are more focused on actual fitness as well.It also has other educational apps to download that my 5-year old son enjoy. Ocean Rift takes him under water to explore the sea and animals within, and there’s also an app to explore the planets and outer space (can’t remember the name right now).I had to do an expensive upgrade to the head strap as the standard one that comes with was inconvenient for adjusting it between myself and my kid.My only problem is that it is white. I’m not sure yet as I’ve only had it for a couple weeks but that seems like not a good color choice as I think it might get discolored over time from the oils on our hands and fingers.The other issue is that this is NOT for people who get motion sickness very easily. I rarely ever get motion sickness but there’s been a few times that I have gotten very disoriented from using it.Overall a pretty cool little device. A little spendy and the head strap upgrade was definitely overpriced but if it helps me be healthier then it’s worth it

I've owned a Quest 2 previously and really like it, so I decided to purchase the 128 GB after a special. However, this was not the same. Immediately after putting it on, I felt super disoriented, and taking it off, I felt super cross-eyed. There was a fish-eye distortion on objects in VR as well.I got it replaced, and did not have this issue at all with the new unit.So be warned, there are quality control issues with these.

This product excels in several areas: (1) It is a really cool VR rig and works great, and (2) it is spectacular at causing facial discomfort and giving you a headache within ten minutes.  The product is 5 stars, IF you get a replacement head rig to hold it on your head without torture/pain.  However, since I am rating the product as shipped, it's 1 star.  Really not even that.  I wouldn't take payment to wear this iron maiden!  It literally has negative value, as shipped.It simply is not usable as shipped.  You must get a replacement head strap, or you are in for physical torture.  What was Oculus/FB/Meta thinking?  They didn't bother to test this??There are the ""elite"" and ""halo"" head gear types and really you should just do what I did and watch some video reviews of ""elite strap replacements"" and you'll get an idea pretty quick - I'm telling you, without a replacement strap you are setting yourself up for a Bad Time with this product.  I bought two of them to try them, and the one that arrived first is on my rig and it's night-and-day different.  I am not putting which one I bought here because it's better if you decide for yourself - there are many choices - just search for ""oculus head strap"".

This will be thorough and I will cover everything I can.This is a great console, don't get me wrong. It has changed my life. However, oculus makes this with the cheapest possible materials. When a replaceable part breaks, they want it shipped back and you have to handle that yourself. Estimated ship time was a month To, not round trip. I told them no. The bracket at the top of the goggles that you feed the strap through, broke off entirety. It's flexible plastic. A joke. I ordered a 3d printed replacement and will be fixing it myself. Meanwhile, I use doubled over duct tape for a top strap, to get in my daily work outs and play with friends. Be prepared to spend money on accessories, as there are alot of bad things about them. Not only are the brackets for the straps prone to breaking, so us their brand replacement strap( elite strap). The stock strap holds none of the weight, and gets uncomfortable within 5 mins. I bought a 3rd party ratchet strap, way more comfortable, and lasts me hours of use at a time. The facial padding, is terrible and there is a recall on it. So they include a silicone cover for the material, instead of a new model facial interface, lazy AF. I replaced that with a VR over brand facial interface. They come with loads of extras. 2 pad thicknesses, which are removable to be replaced, sanitary covers that are disposable etc. There is also some mix up within the community on what batteries to use. So most people buy the charge base, from Anker which is an oculus official recommendation. Don't, they overheat and can catch controllers on fire. The batteries that come in the controllers, are nimh 1.5v single use high output batteries. Most rechargeable batteries are only 1.2v, and will /sometimes/ causing response and tracking issues. If you have more then enough light sources, it won't be noticeable. If you have average lighting, you may have issues. There are lights, IR, in the controllers to track them in the headset, so they drain alot on the battery. I would recommend 1.5v lithium ion rechargeable AAs from tenavolt.Pros: Loads of games. Including workout options.Good for it's price, capable.You can also tour world locations, and concerts when they are streamed.Watch TV and movies with certain apps (Netflix, YouTube, big screen, etc)Facebook integrated, for social reasons, that's handy.Not nearly as Intimidating as people seem to think VR is. Most games are rated by standing/sitting/ or roomscale and how intense motion sickness ""could"" be.Ability to adjust eye spacing.Best entry level to Vr based on price and capabilitiesRefund policy on apps is great. If you have less then 2 hours of use time, and Haven't owned the app longer then 7 days. You can refund right from the phone/PC app, no questions asked.Safety features for play space and object detection. Until you're used to surroundings I suggest using all guardian features. Boundaries, guardian, and space sense. It will show a wall of your play space in VR to stop you from going out of bounds. Space sense projects outlines of objects and people when glancing around you, and within a few feet. Passthrough is also useful. Double tap a finger on either side of goggles, to turn on night vision external cameras to see Through the goggles.In app calorie and movement tracking for fitness. Heads up display overpay in games allow you to track fitness daily goals, while playing with the Oculus Move app. Can be intrusive in some games with extreme up or down glances.Cons:Battery life is short. As low as 1 hour for large-scale games like MMOs, as long as 3-4 hours for single player games, but rarely.Needs accessories to be user friendlyUncomfortable strapWeak parts, prone to breaking. (my unit is 2 months old and broke)Controller battery confusing. 1.5v single use nimh or 1.5v continuous lithium ion rechargeable AA, per controller.Recommended charge base, NOT SAFE. Mine constantly overheated within minutes of charging.Oculus official accessories are stupid expensive. 80-90$ for a cable for charging/PC connectionSupport is terrible /Facebook/There IS an adjustment period. Can cause disoriented sensations and motion sickness. Start out with short sessions, multiple times throughout the day/per week to adequately adjust. Takes time. I have vertigo issues and I manag d to adjust within a few weeks. First week was terrible, but fun.Passthrough safety function can accidentally be turned on, his which temporarily turns game off. Adjusting headset fit will register as double tapping. Recommended to turn it off, with experience level. There is a shortcut on the popup menu.

Why would I use a quest when I have an Index? Because my index has a big cable sticking out of the back, and if I get sweaty, the comfortable foam around the headpiece and face mask sucks up all my sweat and seals it in. I don't want a stanky headset.The quest comes with a silicon gasket that goes over the foam. It doesn't feel great at first but you get used to it. And the first time you get sweaty doing a VR work out, and find you can clean the sweat with a napkin and it just wipes off that silicone, you will understand why it's superior to fabric or foam. It's super easy to keep clean. So you can go ballistic in beatsaber, get 30 min of cardio, and not worry about stinking up your headset.The display is also really good, seems higher resolution than my Index, definitely easy to use it as a web browser, watch movies, etc.The on board audio is nowhere near as good as real headphones or the Index audio, but its perfectly adequate for gaming, although you do have to crank the volume to 100%. Also, at high volume, bass tends to move air near your temples, which tickles. You'll be playing beat saber and suddenly feel like a bug is crawling on your forehead when the bass drops.The strap it comes with is trash. Throw it away the first chance you get and buy the elite strap with battery.The power cable it comes with is too short to use while playing.The controllers are comfortable and feel better than the Reverb G2's larger and more plasticy feeling ones. As a bonus, they only use 1 AA battery and I get WEEKS of battery life with daily use. My Reverb G2 goes through 2 AA's in a single long play session and I get at most a few days of use out of it. It also doesn't like rechargables and wants alkalines so it gets $$$. The quest controllers last forever on 1 battery.The experimental features really make the Quest fun. The hand tracking works really well, allowing you to use the headset on a bus, plane, or in public without breaking out the controllers. You won't be gaming with it, but you can browse the web and watch movies without the need for controllers.The pass through video is as good as the Valve Index except it's in black and white only. But you get a very natural feeling 3d video experience that allows you to double tap the headset, and instantly see your room with natural 3d depth perception. I can walk around the house with the headset on and not worry about hitting stuff.The quest versions of popular games are graphically simpler than steam versions, and you have to buy games you already own a 2nd time, but it's worth it for the un-cabled awesome that is the VR exercise regimen.Get an hour of cardio a day and not feel like you're working out. Quest will keep your brain and your body younger longer.

I had a bit of trouble setting it up to work with SteamVR, but eventually, I figured it outMore specifically, I didn't understand at first how the main Oculus interface and the Oculus desktop app are correlated with each other; only then I discovered that I had to get the Virtual Desktop app from the Oculus store on the main interface, not through the desktop appI also put on the silicon thing for the face, and while it helps quite a bit, it's not perfect; sometimes the headset just pushes against the nose a little too much, so I have to adjust itOverall, the price for wireless SteamVR gaming is well worth it!EDIT Oct 12, 2021Eventually, I figured out how to play SteamVR games over Oculus Link/Air Link: after enabling the feature (in the desktop app under Beta and in the headset under Experimental), you need to add each game manually via the desktop app, and then in the headset, from within the Link interface, go to Library, making sure to show in the filter Unknown Sources, and your game(s) will appear thereHowever, keep in mind that some games will take some trial and error to adapt for accurate tracking (for me, it was Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality)

So far so good.  The quality feels great in my hands.  The leather seems supple but firm.  The plastic component, although the time of the white is ever so slightly off from the headset.  Somewhat of a Greyish tint but i wood have never noticed it except I’m trying to be critical of this product.  I paid for this with my own $, no inducement of any sort.  Worth trying out.  Also I have not tried the official elite strap but the greater padding of this strap appealed to me so I bought this one instead.

Yes people, it's once again that time of year where we are all eating celery, drinking water and using our gym memberships and dusty exercise bikes! We also have an older X-Box 360 Kinect, which we use for Zumba, Dance and other games that really help you work up a sweat. Between weights, treadmill, elliptical and the X-Box we feel like we have plenty of options to keep us working out 3-4 times a week until we give up in April! (let's be realistic).Anyhow, the X-box is getting a little finicky so we decided to look for a newer model. Sure, you can get the X-Box One, which is now a generation old, with the Kinect camera, but Microsoft isn't offering the Kinect option with the newer X-Box X. I saw an Oculus commercial and decided to do some research.After looking at the 3-4 popular VR options, the Quest seemed like the no-brainer. There is PS-VR, which requires a PS5 (good luck finding one, and by itself it's 2x the price of the Quest 2) and you still have to buy the PS VR headset itself. Interestingly enough it works with a camera on the PS5 that looks similar to the Kinect camera. There are other VR headsets out there that are rated highly, and may have more gaming power and resolution, but they are 3-4x as expensive as the Quest 2.So I bought a Quest 2, some important accessories (Anker charging station, silicone cover for the foam face cover, and an upgraded headset with integrated extended life battery) and started surfing.First of all, if you think VR is cheesy or not-enveloping, poke around and look at ""Conquer Your Fear of Heights"" or ""Shark Attack"". Your eyes can really fool the rest of your body when you're in VR! Second, the games on this are lightning quick with accurate representation of your movements in real time. You can watch YouTube or Amazon Prime VR programming, surf the web, and find all sorts of neat VR stuff through the headset.After demoing some games and poking around, I decided to purchase Beat Saber. I know, this is not a 'deep cut' but within 20 minutes I was addicted. Who knew cutting neon boxes to the sounds of electronica would be so fun??Skeptical you can get a good workout in VR? Go to volume 3 or 4 or the extras section of Beat Saber and do 20 minutes. Within 20 minutes I'm sweating (that's why you get the silicone protector) heart was beating 110 BPM and my Apple Watch recorded a dance workout where I burned 350 calories and got 3400 steps. If you set the difficulty higher (from Easy to Normal, for instance) it's like running faster on a treadmill; you get a better workout because you're just chopping away at boxes, dodging walls, ducking, and at times you feel like a rock drummer as you crash boxes to the rhythm of those electronic beats.Would I use this as my only exercise option? Probably not, but does it feel like I'm trudging away on a treadmill, just waiting for it to be over? Not at all! 20-30, even 75 (!) minutes goes by so fast when you're in the zone, just crushing your old high-score.This isn't a Beat Saber review, but just one example of a cool ""fitness game"" you can play. There is also Dance Central, Audica, and many other enveloping VR options where you really get yourself moving.You can pay a lot of money for fitness equipment or game consoles, so I feel like the $299 I spent on this and the additional $150 of accessories was easily worth the price. Everyone who comes over uses it and loves it so I feel like in 2 weeks we've already got our money's worth from it. You don't NEED the accessories either. We used it for a couple of days with only what came in the box and it was fine. The accessories just make it a bit more convenient and comfortable.

VR is great, i've been doing it since 2016.  I got the first Quest when it came out then the second when it came out.  VR is much more than gaming.  It's just as much educational and social as it is gaming.  I'm old, so to watch video games go from Pong to the VR of today was an incredible journey.Pros,1) It's wireless VR, amazing, great fun and exercise.Cons,1) A Facebook account is required/isn't required, eventually it will be.  The problem isn't so much that an account is required, it what Facebook/Meta does with the information they thoroughly collect about you, me, our friends and relatives, so everybody and how we all relate.2)  Facebook/Meta was never a Operating System company before they bought Oculus.  So you end up with updates that screw things up or take features away.  For example, when the Quest first came out, you had parties and other communication options in VR, but with an update, Facebook took those things away and required a data vacuum account (Facebook).  Another example, the IPD setting got messed up with an update.  I then had an IPD pop up in middle of the gaming view regularly.  There was an adjustment you could make to disable it but required a sidequest hack every time you used the headset.  There is a long thread in a Facebook forum of all the users affected by this but i think Facebook/Meta simply ignored us.3) They stop providing controllers for your headset.  For example, if you own a Quest 1, they stopped selling controllers for it a while back.  If it breaks or wears out, you'r SOL.  Pretty sad they don't support their customers.  They should have a warning to let us know that after you buy the Quest, spare parts will only be available for a limited time.  You currently can't replace a Quest 2 controller.  Controllers break, things happen.  If Facebook/Meta isn't going to allow third parties to develop controllers then Facebook/Meta needs to keep offering them for people who invest into Facebook's products.  We all don't have Zuckerberg money, some of us scrape to get our hands on a headset.  Mark might want everybody buying a headset every two years, but many people can't afford that.I've come to the conclusion that Facebook is all about collecting our data and the Quest is a tool to accomplish that goal.  I don't believe that they are serious about VR.  They bought VR, they didn't develop it.  The day another company comes out with a decent wireless VR headset, i can't buy it fast enough.I rate VR 5 stars, Oculus developed something amazing.I rate Facebook's/Meta's implementation/purchase of it, 2 stars

I am an FPV Drone Racing Pilot, not many know what that is, but some will, I got into it and got out of gaming, just didnt see anything in games that compare to flying until one day when a friend of mine got one of these and brought it over to my house.. WOW, When I put it on I knew I had to buy one..... and here is my review one month later...Pro's - This has so much potential, it is a lot of fun and very immersive, many things to do with youtube and other programs that make the free part of it great.. The games are not bad priced and seem to be pretty good for the most part, plenty of titles and more coming out is great. The daily deals and things like that make the games even more affordable..Con's - OK, so lets start with the size, it is a bit large and a little heavy, I do understand that most of the weight is the lenses, they are pretty heavy due to how they are made, but no OLED screens for a box like this was I think a mistake, with that type of resolution even the older games would look better and a lot more clear for what their lens does. It's glitchy, and I mean glitchy, the first one I got had a sound issue and I could no longer communicate with others on the oculus, so I turned it in and they sent another one..  But this one has many glitches as it just will go out without warning and not come back on, then I wait for a moment and it will start up again and I can play.. but many games crash and the system crashes on a pretty regular basis, now I do play a lot so? but shouldnt matter, that should be the goal.. Battery life, now this is for not only gaming but for watching movies, hanging out with friends, and trolling in a social environment, which means that you will most likely wear this thing for hours.. battery lasts about 2 and half hours of constant use.. I bought a 10 thousand MaH battery to strap to the back and it works really well, but ads quite a bit of weight to the headset. With the lipo tech these days, they should have a battery that lasts at least 8 hours.. The battery I bought lasts about 8 to 10 hours of use. They need to come out with the super deluxe bundle package.. Many things you will want to get pretty quick... The battery, extra headset, the one they offer is not bad, but was really spendy and I got an aftermarket one for quarter the cost. carry case that will accommodate the extra large heads trap.FINAL THOUGHT - Buy or no? Well I do have fun with it, I find myself in it quite a bit, but I see the games getting bigger and bigger, the size of the memory is not even close to what it should be, so I got the 256, which I will be out of room soon.. I would also suggest getting the extra strap and battery as well right off the bat.. you will run out of power getting it set up then you will want to explore but wont have the power.I would say its a good buy at 300 bucks and not bad at 400.. but much more improvements will hopefully be coming ..I will recommend this product as it is fun, immersive and will eventually be what everyone is doing.

I know by the title you think I am under the wrong product for review, but I’m not. I am reviewing the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. I started using my sons oculus when he went away to his dad‘s house for Christmas and got addicted to beat saber. I loved it so much that I didn’t want to give his headset back when he got home so I had to buy my own. I play at least an hour of beat saber every single day and I have lost almost 24 pounds since. This is the most fun I’ve had working out ever. I don’t even realize that I’m burning so many calories because I’m having so much fun. I love that you can play online with other people and compete against them.I also bought the Walk Around mini golf game which is really fun and nice and relaxing except for when they drop you on top of the cliff. It really does feel like you’re standing on top of a cliff which can be a little unnerving at first.I think the only complaint that I have is the strap for the headset. It’s very difficult to keep this on your head unless you have a ponytail you can tuck under the strap to make it tighter. I ended up buying an elite strap for my son and I and while I didn’t like having to shell out the extra money so that we could actually play with the VR headsets, it’s still worth it.

My friend gave me a taste of this VR headset. I said why not? I was hooked when I got that taste. So I decided to buy the 256GB with the elite headset and bag for over 500$. Which wasnt a bad deal.  When I got the device first thing I noticed was a hiccup in synching my phone mobile app to utilize the device but after some troubshooting i was able to get it to connect. Though synching with my mobile was an issue. Another problem I notice was the battery life. It drains the battery very fast which is about 2 hours.  Other problems was connecting to PC i wish the USB cord allowed me to connect to my PC to transfer files. I had to use google drive to upload and download files. When I watch movies my controllers would make a grid which interferes with movie experience. 4K VR movies comes out grainy. Resolution is not so great. Which is kind of disappointing. Hopefully they would make better improvements. After 2 weeks of owning this device the battery will not charge anymore. So i have to return it.  The only good thing is the controls are responsive and easy to use interface.  I am waiting for Occulus 3 to make improvements. This is not a good product.

I got my order super fast.  Literally about 24 hours. When I got it I went to set it up and noticed the serial number was Different than what was printed on the box. When looking through the lenses on the right hand side there was what looked like a blue ribbon About an inch long that wouldn’t go away. I was also not able to set it up I couldn’t get past the five digit code screen even though it said my quest was registered an active. Was sent back I got the new one today and will try it when I get home.EDIT:  I got my new quest and what a difference. The box was actually shrink wrapped unlike the other box I got that was not.  the serial numbers also matched. Are use the new quest for about 30 minutes and it was awesome. But I’m leaving this review at one star because they sent me a returned product that didn’t work. I suggest you go to Best Buy or some other store  to buy this and not Amazon. I will be rethinking how I order things.

I like the oculus because it's a viral realty system that puts you in places you have never been before and always wanted to go. Yes if you like traveling you can travel to any state or country. You can go to places you always been dreaming about going.  And you can play tennis, bowl, golf, exercise travel etc. play with your friends. I have been around the world with the oculus, and enjoyed every minute of it and every trip.  Theres so much more you can do. Yes I recommend it for any one who can keep in mind that it just VIRTUAL REALITY ONLY. And i stress that because everything you do, makes you feel like your actually doing it.  If you love roller coasters you don't have to leave your home to get the thrill. But keep in mind you could get Dizzy. And you do feel the sensation of riding. Also if you love animals you can see them up close.

Now that Ive gotten 50 hrs or so in, across a few apps and games I feel comfortable in reviewing this. It works great and really brings you to another world when it goes smooth. That being said it does have charging while playing issues not related to your PC do some research problems are more than a year old and Oculus responds with they are aware and working on it. Apparently at a snails pace but at least they acknowledge it. I wont suggest one product over another but a few solutions are available and can be bought on Amazon and elsewhere to remedy it until they get around to figuring it out. This is a quick changing and newish tech so its fair to say there will be growing pains. As far as wireless it works great I also got the elite strap with additional battery this is a must, a little pricey but changed the entire feel and use of the headset! Again many other choices at lower price but I find you get what you pay for as I tried to cheap out on 2 diffrent Link cables to PC and just wound up retrurning and buying over priced Oculus brand cable but you know what it hasnt failed since so I guess I got what I paid for regardless of my feelings on pricing. This can be a really cool learning tool, entertainment tool and even a productive tool the applications I can imagine will be limitless one day. As of today I stil hate the costs associated and it took me awehile to save and convince myself to buy it my only regret is I didnt do it sooner. If your not tech savy or dont have immediate access to someone that is I would avoid this for now, but if your patient and willing to learn a bit and do some research from time to time you will really enjoy this. Just pace yourself and build a tolerance as it can be disorienting and vomit inducing at times took me a good week to be able to stay on a couple hours without side effects LOL

Bought this to play pc vr games on, it my first headset and was somewhat hesitant since it was technically a standalone unit. Waited for a while and watched reviews on it and finally splurged and purchased it. Just in the main ""room"" I was in awe. Played the tutorial and was in awe... Once I played some pc vr I was in a whole another world. I have been playing it with the air link and have had no issues with it. First title I played was Hellblade: Senua's Sacrafice because I already had it and it was already an amazing game on just the monitor. Hooooollly crap! I was not expecting it to be that much more amazing it in vr! Bought more pc vr games since then and have not been disappointed! Most recent was Half-Life: Alyx and so far seems extraordinary! I highly recommend this headset. Only downside is Facebook.

The Quest2 is acceptable for its price. Although you will have to spend quite a bit extra for a link cable, a headstrap upgrade, some nice earbuds/headphones, and so on. The controllers are surprisingly good, but nowhere near as good as the Valve Index ""Knuckles"" Controllers. The Quest2 will not give you the ultimate experience, but it will get you into VRchat or Beat Saber on a budget.Normally, I'd give this headset around a 4/5, but there's 1 little issue. You must have a Facebook account, and you must link your Quest2 to your smartphone. You have to hand over basically all of your personal information just to use the thing, and currently there's no method to completely avoid this process. It's a massive violation of privacy, and unacceptable for a piece of hardware to require from its users.Yes, you can give false information, but you risk getting banned and unable to use your headset anymore. Yes, there are ways to deal with all of this, but you must be very tech-savvy and be willing to invest hours into setting things up - and even then, there's always the chance of a stealth update ruining your whole set-up.So yes, it's a decent headset, but even if it was literally free I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone because of the Facebook integration.

It's a fun all in one VR but it's not a big jump from the Go version like you would think. It's worth buying for gaming but if you just like to watch VR and not a big gamer then I would just buy the Go. The PQ is not alot better and you would only notice if you side by side the quest2 and Go to see it. Sound hands down is better on the Go it has more of a surround FX and is clearer in sound over all then the quest 2 only thing quest 2 has over the Go in sound it has way more bass. Some apps I like on the Go are not on the quest 2 which I see as dumb because you would understand if the Go could not play quest 2 apps then okay because you would think the Go does not have the better video card,processor or whatever but for the quest 2 not to have Go apps you had before is just dumb and shows lack of backwards compatible from oculus. I was very dispointed with the Oculus quest 2 out of the box because I was thinking it was going to be blowing the Oculus Go out of the water in every which way but it does not. Onces your over the dispointment like I was it's not bad the quest 2 if you look at it as it's just different then the Go and not as better. Quest 2 you need to change refresh rate to 120hz in setting and you can get a third party app to help changes more setting to make the quest 2 have a better PQ so keep that in mine you can YouTube all that if you want to know more. I don't like some things on the quest 2 seem like a down grade from the Go version like Sound,there no sound volume numbers anymore like 1 to 15 on the Go,there no display brightness anymore,the power and sound buttons in a different location then the Go and there not in a better spot I think,even the charging light is now in a dumb spot which is on the side of the quest 2 so now you have to pick it up to see if it's charged or tilt your head to see it when on the Go it's right on top of it so boom you can see it a mile away without picking it up it's charged,head strip is more uncomfortable on the quest 2 then the Go out of the box yes you can get a upgraded strip with added battery from Oculus but that extra money. There was just some dumb moves made by Oculus on the quest 2 but not saying there where not go moves made too like the controls there are two they track your hands and you do not need to even uses controls at times because you can track your own hands. The extra cameras on the quest 2 are nice you can tap the side of the Quest 2 to turn them on to see where your going and not have to remove the VR off your face,you can now walk in VR walk and look around more way better then the Go version there. You can adjust your eye lens good move there. Is it super faster then the Go no but it is a faster VR all in one then the Go which still helps in fast moving gaming. So get the quest 2 if you game and play more games then watch VR but if your just a VR watcher like using it to sit in a roller coaster,looking at mountain,look at shows,movies,plays,magic shows and etc..... Just things you sit and watch then buy the Go and save lots of money you do not need the quest 2.

I am an avid gamer and was drawn in to VR after a buddy told me about the Occy Quest 2. Right away I can say there is a lot of value here for $299. Unlike other VR systems, you don't need a computer or anything to use this. You just need an internet connection to install some games. There is also a lot of free content and demos that can be enjoyed as you start to get a feel for being in a VR environment. So far I have said a lot of positive things so why a 1/5 star review? Here is what you don't realize until after you use a VR headset...This gives you motion sickness. People will argue on the severity but the community of players will collectively agree that this is not something you can just bring with you on a family holiday visit, and strap your uncle, aunt, mom, dad, grandpa, and grandma into without causing them to want to throw up their lunch/dinner after 5min.When I first started thinking about VR, I remembered back to the Nintendo Wii. I put the Nintendo Wii controls into my family members hands and they bowled, played baseball, boxing, etc and thought it was fun. None of them felt like puking afterwards. However I can't replicate that same gimmicky nostalgia that the Nintendo Wii offered us 10 yrs ago with this Occy Quest 2. The VR experience is just too intense for most people. You have to be extremely careful about how you show this to people that have no prior VR experience.If your thought process was, I want the Occy Quest 2 for myself but also to show off to all my family/friends so they think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, you will likely be tremendously disappointed with the results.If you do have a group of people that you want to show this to that you feel are able to handle it, then this is how I would suggest setting up..Step one is the get into the VR yourself and create a stationary boundary from a seated position. A sturdy chair that someone can sit it while in VR.Next, you will cast your Occy Quest 2 to a TV or laptop so you can spoon feed the VR user step-by-step directions on where to navigate.Next, you will have them get into the VR and launch First Steps for Quest app. This is a simple tutorial with a very calm environment. Easy for a beginner to get comfortable with the controls and try a couple simple VR novelty tricks like picking up and throwing some blocks, paper airplanes, shooting ray guns, etc.Once they are done with this First Steps for Quest, you should encourage them to stop playing. This is usually a tipping point for a new user where their brain is going to start fighting with their stomach and rejecting this VR experience. VR motion sickness is not fun and can last awhile. If you jump on Youtube and look up ""VR sadness"" or ""VR depression"" you can hear people talk about the disassociation with reality working in conjunction with their motion sickness that new users experience with VR making them feel like depressed garbage for the rest of the day or even for a day or two. Don't let new users get to this point hahaIf the person insists on wanting more, I would have them check out VR Animations App. You should already have a couple neat saved animations that they can jump into and look at. This is a fun program to showcase the cool little things that VR can offer and it really is a cool visual experience. Be careful to avoid animations that spin, rotate, or give the feeling that the VR user is in motion (example: sitting in or next to a car that is driving down a road).Overall, this is really a neat device. I think VR is going to be around for awhile or some version of it. We are quickly going to see VR headset power and resolution make huge leaps and bounds in the next couple years. I predict that someday soon you will no longer furnish your living room at home with speakers, TVs, big sectional couches, etc. to watch your TV shows and movies. Instead you relax somewhere comfortable and slip on your VR headset and be transported to some massive movie theatre in space, sitting next to popcorn guzzling aliens, and watching some 3D animated movie off of Amazon Prime Video VR or other subscription based service.and as interesting, amazing, or terrifying as this may sound not everyone is going to be able to handle this level of stimulation. So VR wisely! Scale your expectations appropriately! and good luck out there!

This VR Headset for a birthday gift is turning into an expensive gift I don't have the time or money for. After the headset, you basically need to hell out another 80$ for this cable and then another 10-15$ for an adaptor for the COMPUTER you need to connect it too. Why does it not come with adaptors?Beginning to think if I dig deep enough I will find that Apple owns Oculus and that will explain all of the gadgets and doo-dads I need to buy to get anything to literally work.Will be leaving same review on the stupid 80$ cable had to buy to get it working too

After a week of using the Oculus Quest 2, I allowed my son to play some of the social apps such as Horizon Worlds and Rec Room. Within that day he was suspended for the Horizon Worlds app, and the following morning I woke to find that Oculus had suspended my account for 24 hours.The suspension ‘bricked’ the $300 dollar headset. Even the games I’ve purchased were not available, even if they were solo games which have no social aspect to it. The suspension came after an email was sent to me stating that the account violated the code of conductI will admit that I have one of those kids who can shut up if his life depended on it, and that in social situations he is that bubbly kid who will friend anyone and rattle off about all kinds of kid stuff. This can be considered annoying (I admit it is annoying, and I love my kid unconditionally). I’m certain his behavior found him being reported, and the report resulted in the suspension.Oculus customer support is absolutely horrible. The chat feature simply regurgitated to me what I just told them. Imagine answering a question and then the person trying to answer your question with your answer. That was Santiago G… customer service rep numero uno.So here I sit… with a $300 brick and some fancy hand controllers which do nothing and no explanation can be provided. Needless to say I’m returning this and hoping for a refund. Probably won’t get a single penny on any of the games I purchased. Save your money… get your kid a Nintendo switch.

Product is great, is how Amazon handled their Black Friday promotion of a $50 credit being the reason why this is one star. I added the Oculus too my cart to decide if I wanted to use Amazon or another store (Target and Bestbuy was running the same promotion). I Purchased through Amazon because there were other products I wanted to purchase from Amazon as well.I read on Amazon site that sometimes it takes a few weeks for promotion to apply, which didn’t make much sense but ok, I decided to wait. 2 weeks go by and I reach out for Amazon for support. Basically, “Nicolas” was not any help and basically said since I didn’t do an “Instant Buy”, the promotion did not apply. Honestly, I don’t even remember if I did instant buy or not, because I did remove the Oculus from my cart before changing my mind. Basically, Amazon support is saying that I will not receive the promotion credit when at any time did I read you must do an “Instant Buy” to receive it. I also have a friend who experienced the same issue with Amazon.So the product itself is 5 stars, how Amazon handled the promotional aspect is a 1 star, and I will be returning and contemplating using Amazon for future purchases.

This is better than my PSVR by heads and shoulders.The wireless freedom, the games, the experiences all feel top notch. I am quite pleased. I am in love with Real VR Fishing and Eleven Table Tennis.I removed a star due to a few things. These aren’t big things, but definitely things you need to consider before buying. Most of them mean hidden costs.1. Hidden cost of having to buy a better head strap. Seriously, the one included is very uncomfortable.2. The case this goes in is extra and doesn’t fit my new 3rd party head strap.3. Battery life isn’t great and I will probably need to get a back up battery to make the experiences last longer.4. My wife gets very sick using it, even in stationary games. Glad I tested this out before I got a pair of them.5. The package is very barebones. No controller guards or no rechargeable batteries for the controllers. Crappy head strap. No case or even lease wipe.6. Facebook account. Ughhh. Soon this will be removed, but ughhhh. Facebook is the worst thing ever. -11 stars for this alone.Bottom line—If you want a top notch VR experience without wires and a fancy computer or PlayStation. This is the thing to get. Just be ready to spend a little more to make it a far better experience.

I’m new to VR and had no idea what I’ve been missing! This is unbelievable! The Oculus 2 provides enjoyment for so many of my different interest, I honestly had no idea how useful it would be. If you’re looking to purchase a piece of exercise equipment for daily cardio look no further, the Oculus makes your workout so much fun and time flies by so quickly. It’s not only amazing for physical fitness, the brain gets its share of exercise as well. After a fun filled workout, I typically enjoy some virtual travel and often go chill at some of the most peaceful destinations on earth at the click of a button. On lazy days you can kick back in your recliner and have just as much fun doing a number of different things available on the Oculus as well. The content available is growing at a very rapid rate, I think that no matter what your interests are you’ll find so much to enjoy and will not regret this purchase. I can’t describe how life changing this has been and I honestly feel it has improved my health and quality of life. I could never really get interested in cardio or any type of exercise and stick with it until the Oculus came into my life, my health paid the price and statistics say the same for so many others in this country. Take action and encourage others to do so as well!

As you all have done, I did my research and this product was hyped and rated excellently. First off, when I put the headset on, I thought maybe it was broken. The focal point of this is so small everything that isn't exactly a midline is blurry. Text is fuzzy. I tried all of the different focus settings and at the very best it wasn't good. Got on the internet and realized that this is a huge problem with the headset. And there's no fix for it. I said it aside for a day and came back to it and the video wouldn't turn on. It had sound, so I could tell I was on a loading screen, and after I reset, which was recommended, it still didn't turn on. I contacted Oculus and after 30 minutes on a chat session they told me they would get back to me in a few days and let me know what I should do. Very unhappy that there was no immediate fix or any kind of tech support to try something different with it. Apparently a reset is about the only thing you can do. I'll wait a few days to see what happens. Maybe I just got a bad one.

As you should know already, Facebook is required. While trying to log into Facebook I got stuck in an endless loop of logging in. Oculus support recommended trying a different device so I logged into my computer with Facebook and got completely locked out of my account of 12 years for trying to log into an unrecognized device. So. I have a 300 brick and can't access any of my personal info on Facebook. Thanks, Meta. Don't waste your time or money.

I own a Rift S and wanted a wireless option without breaking the bank , this headset was an upgrade in every way except 1. The Halo Headband on the Rift S is incredibly comfortable and takes 95% of the load off of your neck and back , which allows for longer game sessions. Now while the Quest 2 is great for short 30 minute sessions , it starts to show that the factory strap is severely flawed. I had extreme neck pain after only an hour and a half of playing on the quest 2 and with my Rift S i can easily go for 6+ hours with no discomfort. I suggest buying a 3rd Party ""elite"" or ""halo"" strap to fix the issue , as there are plenty available for between $25 - $50 USD on amazon.

To get right to the point, I cannot recommend this device. While it did eventually get set up, there are unneeded hoops to jump through that cause problems both on the technical side and on the trust side.To set up, you are required to have or open a Facebook account. I get that Facebook bought Oculus, so that's where it stems from, but there is no valid technical reason for this requirement. Why is this needed? Simply to boost FB registration numbers? To make a grab for personal info? It does not inspire trust.The second irritating, unnecessary hoop is requiring you to install a mobile device app and to pair the headset. I ran into problems with this which took using a second phone to get it accomplished. Thankfully the household had a second device available to use. Then, once that was finally done it seems unneeded any more since the headset works without doing anything on that paired phone. Tech support told me that my mesh wifi could be the problem. Really? All a mesh wifi does is present a single SSID to devices connecting to it, how can that interfere?Ultimately it did get working, and tech support was responsive, so it gets a second star for that.

I've had a Facebook account for over 11 years that was previously linked to my Oculus Go around 3 years ago.  I got my Quest a few days ago and when I try to log into the Oculus app with Facebook it just spins.  Customer support said it was a known issue but offered no resolution or a time frame.  From all my login attempts, my Facebook account of 11 years was frozen.  Not worth the hassle for me.  Sorry, Oculus.  You lost a customer.

Fantastic, I had no idea that I could work out inside and burn so many calories. I run, I cycle, but I never burned after a 40 minutes workout. I downloaded Supernatural, the Fitness app, and I burned 640 calories after 30 minutes of workout. I had to squat, punch, and destroy objects and my arms are sore already. I love the oculus and I will subscribe to the Supernatural app with no doubt. It is like having a full gym inside your home.For the Oculus in general, it is great, of course, I could not wear it for a long time because it leaves me heavy marks on my face and scalp but holy darn, I saw myself in a Total Recall movie. The technology is simply amazing and watching videos in 360 is so amazing. I think this has been the best purchase of my last 10 years without a doubt.I would recommend it - Keep in mind if you wear glasses or lenses you will need those or you won't be able to see well on your oculus.Buy it, I am sure you will love it.

The controllers feel cheap and the headset moves too much when I shake my head even when tightened. The biggest deal-breaker is that they require Facebook to use it and if you get banned from Facebook you lose everything you purchased. The field of view is also really disappointing as it feels smaller than looking through a telescope. Overall I'm very unhappy with this purchase and would recommend other brands like the Index over this.

The storage of the Oculus Quest 2, like any gaming console, uses up a healthy chunk of its storage for required software: 11. 3GB, to be exact. Plus, it comes pre-installed with a few demos and First Steps tutorials, but those can be uninstalled if you wish, freeing up a few hundred megabytes. You get a little over 116GB of actual storage with the 128GB Quest 2, while the 256GB Quest 2 has a whopping 245GB left for games storage! Gamers who might want to be future-proof could still consider the 256GB version, but the $399 price makes it less affordable for most. The original Oculus Quest 256GB version didn't make much sense to spend extra money on because original Quest games used to average around 1-2GB in size. These days, the best Quest 2 games now hover around the 8-12GB range for many titles.The Oculus Quest 2 is very cool technology. It is not as cool as the technology in Sword Art Online, but you will not be fighting for your life while being stuck in the game. The headset is a bit on the heavy side but comfortable. The straps are quickly be adjusted front-to-back and side-to-side for the best fit. You can also use a spacer to make extra room for glasses. Most size glasses should fit fine in gear, but oversized frames will not. The hand controls are easy to learn and easy to use. The feedback is excellent, and I have not had trouble with lag. The system as a whole is very responsive. The speakers and microphone are apparent. The OS is very user-friendly, and the system walks you through many tasks when first set up. The audio controls even understand my slurred English. Speakers are built into the headset’s strap supports, offering directional left and right stereo sound. They’re reasonably clear and loud enough to get across your games' drama and directional audio feedback while keeping your ears free to allow you some awareness of your physical surroundings. If you’re playing in a room with a friend, they’ll hear everything going on using the built-in speakers, but there’s also a 3. 5mm jack if you want to connect your headphones for a private session. A decent set of stereo speakers are built into the side arms of the strap and produce immersive positional audio. If you want to be isolated, you can plug a regular set of headphones or earbuds into the headphones socket on the side of the headset, but I liked being able to hear a little bit of the natural world as I played. Definitely worth the purchase!

After enjoying my Oculus Go for the past several years, I decided to upgrade to this thinking my experience would only be improved and was super excited to venture into some of the gaming experiences now that VR has had a few years to mature.Aaaand...I never even made it to the homescreen.  The Quest 2 requires the Oculus app, which then merges into your Facebook account and is necessary in order to pair your headset with the app. Why? Because reasons that's why.  Now, I DID know that going in and was ready to do so.  However, the app never gave me the opportunity.  I got stuck in a literal circle of disclosure and agreement menus and as soon as you clicked ""Agree and Continue"" it would just bounce you back to the previous agreement or bounce you forward to one depending on where you were in the process.After trying two phones and a computer browser, I contacted customer support.  To their credit, I believe they did everything possible to try and get my headset to work and they were all super courteous.  However, after around a week and a half or so of back and forth, and still having the same exact issue with the app, I gave up.  Everything went back in the box and back to Zuckerberg.And what a shame.  I'm certain that it's probably a really good VR experience for those that the app allows to experience it.  I'm also not being over-ominous in saying ""that the app ALLOWS to experience it"" either.  Because if the app doesn't work, your $400 headset is useless.  Oh, but guess what, if anything happens to your Facebook account, your $400 headset will also become useless as well.  So would you buy a computer if Microsoft could lock your machine because they don't like your emails?  Would you buy a phone that could be disabled if the provider didn't like what you talked to people about?

Don't let anyone tell you the rift or rift s is better than this for PC.. this is the best bang for the buck and the image quality and refresh rate is superior to both the rift and rift s. I haven't had tracking issues once and I've been playing wirelessly via virtual desktop exclusively because airlink kinda sucks.. and the link cable I bought randomly disconnects but virtual desktop works flawlessly and I don't notice any latency, then again I'm playing 3 feet from the router.. the stock headband sucks as many others have mentioned as well as the face pad so I upgraded both. The speakers are okay, they're not as bad as everyone makes them out to be but I will be installing a headphone mod on mine. One issue I have is that sometimes the software will freeze when I try to multi task, responding to a Facebook message while streaming my PC for example but a reboot fixes it.. still annoying though. I can't review the all in one aspect of this headset because I use it exclusively for PC VR

If a dead pixel can completely ruin your experience I cannot recommend getting the Quest 2, and here is why,I've gone through a total of 3 Oculus Quest 2s in just under two weeks, and every one of them has had either a stuck pixel or a dead pixel in one or the other screen right out of the box, which means a permanent dot on your screen, I understand VR is fairly new to the market, and Oculus wants to be the affordable option, and boy is it selling,but with all good things, there is the bad, in my research there is no fix for this but to replace the entire unit and hope you get one without a dead pixel, I tried three times with no luck, so a 1 out of 4 chance is your best odds going with my experience, though chances could be worse, or you could get lucky,That said, amazon support is very friendly and helpful, understanding and willing to work with you, at least in my case, in the end I accepted a partial refund and decided to keep the headset, I think it is possible to live with the dead or stuck pixel, but I would suggest getting the 128GB version over the 256GB, save yourself the money, your likely to use steam anyways,If you decide to roll the dice and want to try what I did, getting a headset without a dead or stuck pixel, this might save you some time, don't turn on the headset right away, plug it into its charger, and short press the power button, that won't turn the headset on, only turn on the display briefly to show the power level, it turns on the screen and is mostly black, so if you have a stuck pixel, usually green, red or blue, can be white some times, they are pretty small, so it might take you a few minutes, honestly give yourself 3 minutes at least to find it if its there, but its more visible while the screen is on a dark image, i.e the charging screen, if your lucky, and did not spot a stuck pixel,then go ahead and unplug the headset, power the headset on, during the start screen look around for a black dot that will not go away, a black pixel, sadly is a dead pixel, this happen on my third attempt, why sadly, well with a stuck pixel you at least have a chance to fix it, all though the chances are very low, and I've yet to find anyone that has been able to fix a stuck pixel on the Oculus Quest 2, which usually requires hours of flashing the spot of your screen with the dead pixel with a video flashing between red, green blue for at least 1 but up to 4 hours, some times longer,and if your extremely lucky, and got one with out a stuck or dead pixel, wow . . . . . If you were not lucky, like me, well at least you know a little faster way to spot a dead or stuck pixel, I'd wish you luck but, as I pointed out above, I have non to spare all though I wish it for anyone who dares to attempt to get a perfect quest 2.Otherwise, if you can do without VR right now, do so, or if you can afford a Valve Index, then get a Valve Index, if you don't have a computer to power the Valve Index and or if you can't afford a Index, just be prepared to accept a product that's likely to have a permanent dot, in which case all though my experience so far is very limited, it might not be so hard to live with, though I have not had enough time with my dot, to know if its truly possible to live with, though you'll find ALOT more glowing reviews for the Quest 2 so maybe it really is possible, I'm honestly surprised there are not pages of people mentioning dead or stuck pixels, though there are plenty outside of amazon.

I purchased this for my son for Christmas. He was overjoyed and excited. As he started to try to install it to his  nitro gaming laptop he found that this particular device did not have the graphics card needed to be present to support this device. He was on customer support for over an hour they tried several things we wound up having to return it. My son is heartbroken and I am very angry. If you go on the site there is literally a listing of 6 to 10 laptops and computers that are not compatible with this gaming device. Knowing this The designers have yet to fix this problem since it’s release in 2018 and update their product! I think that they should make it apparent to the consumer that there are certain needs to support this accessory before they purchase it and break their kids heart on Christmas!

Let me preface this by saying, I've never been a video game player, just not my thing. I got this for Christmas, and all I can say is...Wow. As a former ping-pong player in my youth, I decided to give the game a shot. It is so immersive, standing in the middle of the room with the table in front of you, it feels so real. It is so realistic that I keep finding myself wanting to lean on the table for certain shots, big mistake; you need to remind yourself that the environment isn't real. Moved on to golf. Once again, you are standing in the middle of the golf course with 360-degree views of the entire scene, it's incredible.  I've only had this a few days, but if what I've seen so far is any indication, I am a video game person. I just had to find the correct format. Love it.

I love this, though I wish it were a bit wider for use with glasses, and I wish they sold replacement cushions for it more inexpensively as I am sweating. Otherwise, it's nearly perfect! This is a very polished experience.Wireless is super important. While I did get the pricey link cable for use with my PC, and I will be playing PC games on this headset, I underestimated how much better it is to be wireless. I will explore the Airline (wireless PC connection) too, but again using this with a PC adds a layer of complexity. If you want to use this by itself for a quick session, that's where it really shines as it's easy to put on and go.While Oculus is owned by Facebook, and they're begging for government regulation, AND the default sharing settings are too leaky for my taste, I am willing to compromise. I see this as my first, but not last, VR system. I will upgrade in a few years as technology improves, and will consider a different company's platform then. But for now this is a great way to try out VR.The apps are well done and include usual video apps from youtube, amazon prime, and netflix. I am using a few inexpensive games, mostly for fitness and that's working well. You can use transparency mode to set up a virtual safe zone so you can move freely and it'll let you know if you are going out of it. Just very impressive how well it all works.With regard to glasses, I use an older pair that are narrow and fit better. I don't use the included silicone face pad cover because that does get caught on the smaller glasses and that's not good. So, if it's sweaty I detach the face pad and clean it...but I foresee that it won't last forever. Replacements seem to be pricy but I will also experiment with aftermarket ones. A side benefit to this being such a big selling product is that there are numerous third party accessories for it.

I was an early adopter of PSVR.  Over the years I played it less and less, just because it was a hassle to set up.  Not that it was hard, just that it was annoying.The fact that Quest 2 is standalone and no wires is EXACTLY why it's so amazing.  I've had it for nearly 2 months now and I play it every day.  Sometimes multiple times a day.I use it for workouts, which I didn't know was even a thing.  If I can be tricked into physical activity, great!I also having been using Virtual Desktop to tap into my PC so I can run Steam VR.  It works perfectly, all wireless.  128GB is plenty of space if you are debating.Here's an example of a major improvement.  My daughter would use PSVR and I would need to be near to make sure she wouldn't hit the TV or something and have to help her not get tangled up with the cord.  Now with Oculus I set up a Guardian so she can clearly see the invisible walls I set for her and no longer need to untangle her from cords.  You can also stream to a TV using Chromecast or the phone app so you can see what the user is seeing.  The app also gives you control to help them launch games or reset their position.  These improvements are HUGE!I've been BLOWN AWAY how much better the Quest 2 is over older VR headsets, especially PSVR.  Everything looks better and plays with better controls.  I can't see this going down the same road with PSVR where I stop using it, it's just really really good.

The biggest drawback with this headset is the weak USB port and other charging issues. It doesn't take much pressure to break that USB port and once you break it, u might as well throw the whole headset away because there is absolutely no way to repair or replace it. Check the internet for all of the complaints concerning the headset's charging issues and you'll see what I mean. My headset lasted for about 2 months and with the continuous charging, eventually the port became weak and broke and the cable started melting the headset housing around the USB port to the point that it completely stopped charging. Never again will I buy another Oculus headset. A waste of $300.

Likes:-Games are good! Plenty to choose from.-Audio is ok. You can enable Bluetooth earbuds/headphones-VR is in par with Playstation VR but better since you can create a safe space (guardian) and walk around in VR vice just sitting or standing with PSVR.-Quality is good. Combination of plastic and elastics. Not heavy and can play for 3hrs with minimum neck fatigue.-Sickness? Not that bad depending on game/video. For the most part I only felt sick when playing seated. Watching videos didn’t make me sick at all. Now for the bad.-Facebook: Not so much of a bad but more of a why. Seems a bit sketchy having a system with cameras all around watching your home as you traverse on a VR environment. Guardian safe zone? More like now I know your living space and where you spend most the time. Also thanks for the cool interior pics of your house.- Price: I can see myself playing this for a little bit, not as often as my home console. Not that I will stop playing it, but more like not worth $299.99 playing every day type. FYI I got the $200 discount from the Amazon credit card so I only payed $109.00ish.-Head Strap: By far the worst thing this VR headset has. Not only is it uncomfortable but seems like it will break anytime in the near future. Everything points to OCULUS wants you to buy their premium strap.-Battery life: Depending on use you can squeeze like 2.5-3 tops on hours of playtime. This is if you are moderate with what you got turned on and turn it fully off when not in use.I will keep updating this review as time goes by as we all know this was a hot XMas present in 2021. Pandemic and all everyone is down to do some indoor travel a la VR Mode.

This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 12yo daughter. It is a huge hit, not only for her, but her Dad and I have had a blast on it also! Once you have the headset on it feels like you are really in the VR game you are playing. As a parent I like you set perimeters of the room you are playing in and once you leave the set perimeters the game pauses and you can see where you are in the room. This is a great safety feature, especially if you are playing in a room with a lot of obstacles or stairs. Set up was easy, we did have to set up a Facebook account, which I wasn't thrilled about. But, once it is set up it is managed from the VR headset or the app. She has had a blast playing gorilla tag with a couple of her school friends that got the Oculus as well.

Maybe it's because I live in a studio apartment with my elderly, dementia parent. Maybe it's because I'm not interested in getting outside as much due to covid. Or maybe it's inflation. Whatever the reason or excuse, I LOVE the escape these glasses give me.It's addictive!To feel snuggly, alone, and transported is SOO AWESOME!I not only visit other countries, but I love going under water, or overhead with a drone sky-view of the world.I love the feel of the rollercoaster rides. So funny how our minds can cause physical reactions. Love it! Don't get that belly-drop feel, any more - belly's too fat - but I do get a wonderful dizzy feel when descending down the rollercoaster.Watching TV or Prime/Netflix is synonymous to being in my own media room, curled up and cozy.I haven't played any games yet.As interested as I am in AI, the introduction robot creeped me the heck out because it looked me in my eyes and danced with me, responded to my dance movements. How is that possible? Or is that a real human, drawn to look like a colorful stick figure? Rushed through that and never returned.Very meditative. You will fall asleep with this on, several times.I wait till my parent is sleep then I indulge, but since she likes to compete with me - once again proving how young she really is (sigh), I only use once every two weeks. At the end of the day, too tired to put on knowing I'd be snoring within seconds.You can use with Bluetooth or plugin headset, too.I've decided to gift one to someone everyone every year.Enjoy!

This unit seems to be very glitchy. I tried hooking it up to my PC and tried it solo. Games that require ""hand motion"" detect ghost controllers no matter how far away I put the real ones(even put them outside in the car trunk.) When I am hooked to my Gaming PC via airlink, it starts off great but then gets really glitchy within minutes.  The virtual desktop and VR navigation seems to disappear and reappear out of reach...at will. Also, the Oculus Store is inaccessible then it's accessible...then inaccessible again only to be accessible for another brief window only to be inaccessible yet again...you get the idea.My PC is running at around 12% maximum disk use and 110-120 processes. I am running a 10th gen i9 with a dedicated video card and 32gb of RAM...so, if it's not going to work airlinked because my hardware isn't up to snuff then it should not be listed that it's wirelessly PC compatible at all.I ordered a 10ft ultra high speed USB C to USB C data cable to see if it works better when physically tethered. The unit comes with what seems like an intentionally short USB C charging cable in an attempt to sell their way overpriced 10 ft cable. So...we'll see in a few days when the cable arrives.On a side note, why in the world would the manufacturer's design include a power button right underneath the strap? Every time a player tries to physically adjust the headset they unintentionally close everything out only to reopen and find everything aggravatingly rearranged.I thoroughly expected to see my daughter using the headset and sailing through virtual worlds on Christmas morning and not getting so frustrated that she gave up even trying to use it.Maybe my unit is defective. If it's the same way after the new cable arrives then I intend to ask for either a refund or a working replacement.EDIT: The main reason we bought this VR setup was for Roblox VR. The high speed cable came in and VOILA! the glitchy PC connection is no more. The only issue now seems to be that we have to uninstall the headset, restart the PC and reinstall the Quest 2 headset every time we want to use it tethered. However, my daughter loves the Roblox VR play and says it rocks...so, looks like we're going to keep the unit.

I'm a computer-literate senior. I find this fascinating: it literally opens new vistas.  I've pretty much left action games alone, since the old text-based Zork multi-user-dungeon.  Oculus allows me to interact (or not) with fellow Avatars watching various activities, like musical, sports, religious, natural drone vistas, etc. My favorite App (so far) is VR on the International Space Station. 360 degree view of members aboard the craft, explaining various functions; showing you how they exercise, eat, etc. Fascinating! The view from their viewing platform on the ISS is spectacular.Like learning any new tool whether digital or mechanical; expect a learning curve. Do the tutorials, like how to use the controls.  When it gets too frustrating, take a break. Remember, this is supposed to be fun. Repetition facilitates learning.

I saw when these types of headsets came out and I thought the companies would make some improvements as time went on.  These are so HEAVY on my face and very uncomfortable.  In addition in the nose section (after adjusting straps a million times) I could see my REAL rug while trying to pay attention.  I also feel with the expense of the item, some really good FREE apps would have been great to really let me get the hang of it.  Most for adults have FREE with in app purchases.

What they don't tell you about the Quest 2 is that its more narrower than the previous headsets meaning that you have to force your glasses into it which doesn't provide for a very pleasant experience as the glasses dig into the side of your head, you could buy $200 VR lenses (if you have bad vision like me) which at that point I would rather like to track down a Rift S instead.Avoid if you have glasses unless you can justify buying the lenses as well, ontop of a headstrap that should have been included and a 3rd party oculus link cable.

This was a big purchase for us and wow, was it worth it.  We use it primarily for the Supernatural exercise program (requires a subscription).  If you want an incredibly fun -- positively addictive, really -- way of getting your cardio and building some muscle, this is for you.  Being new to VR, I was concerned that the Oculus setup would be difficult and that there would be a steep learning curve.  Nope.  The Oculus takes you through everything you need to do seamlessly.  We have upgraded the head strap and added grip covers (both from Kiwi) as they help keep everything in place when you are moving around as much as we are in Supernatural.  For more stationary apps, the stock setup should be fine.  One thing to be aware of if you wear glasses -- smaller frames fit fine but larger frames will get squished.  Considering the cost of eyeglasses, this is a definite consideration.  We both got prescription VR Wave lenses that fit in the Oculus and this solves that problem (about $100 each and they work amazingly well, even with strong prescriptions.)  So if you are going to just be playing fairly stationary games and don't need glasses, this $300 expenditure will probably be it.  If you want to do what we do, or wear glasses, expect to be spending a bit/lot more.  Would we buy it again?  Absolutely.

(Updated) My son spent his own birthday and holiday presents for over a year to buy this and he loved it.  He loved it so much that all he wanted for Christmas was games for it.  Then it stopped logging in and became unusable.  5 days later trying to resolve with customer support and I've had it.  There's no one to talk to, just chat or email, and all their fixes have failed, even a factory reset.  The weak link here is that it relies on Facebook for everything so if their interface with Facebook breaks down, you lose all access.My 9 year old son is devastated.  I'm furious and out many hours because of their terrible customer service.  Regretting this purchase.If they miraculously come through, I will update but for now... 1 star.Updated: Amazon comes through for the win!  After Oculus's disastrous excuse for customer service, I contacted Amazon and a real human arranged for a replacement THE NEXT DAY!!!  And it works!  My son is happy, I'm happy, I just hope if it breaks down again Amazon can help with the problem because Oculus won't.So yes, super fun, but be aware that if there's a problem, Oculus is not helpful in fixing it.

Doubt anyone will read this review but I have to say I am really into VR. If you have a gaming pc, just download desktop VR and play from your pc, you do have to have a fast router though. I tried the cable but it sucks to have a cable dangling so go wireless, you probably will lose some quality but its wireless so. Oh and Oculus does have its own wireless option to stream from PC but so far I have had less issues with destop VR, I ran into issues using oculus air-link. IDK I could be wrong anyways get this thing its dope, you don't have to just stick to the games from Oculus store, I am playing my steam games, hooked on Skyrim rn, glad i never beat it cause now it really feels like I am in the game.

I like the fact that you don't have to use your phone with all the Oculus apps. Once you download the Quest app it is on the headset and all you have to do is use the headset to play games.  There is not anything that I don't like about the Quest 2 so far.  I am very impressed with the new games for the Quest 2.  There are a lot of free games to keep anyone happy.  Of course some of the best games that they have are ones that you have to pay for.  I have gotten at least 6 paid games so far.  Prices vary between 3.99 to 39.99,  which was very good for my budget right now.

Very impressed by the meta quest 2 graphics, sound, ease of use navigating is really pretty much straight forward just follow prompts and you're good to go. For a VR headset you really do get a lot of value for your money. Not to mention it's a stand alone headset, meaning no need to have your headset wired to a PC (unless you still wanna do it that way, cause you can using a link cable) but why would you want to do that? Personally I use AirLink and it works GREAT! Bringing my family of gamers together and moving is just one of the many benefits this has provided for us and with all the news surrounding the meta verse, it seems we are just starting and will only get better moving forward. 1 potentially HUGE downside for some... As of writing this review you NEED a Facebook account in order to set up your quest 2 VR headset. Fingers crossed this will be removed as a requirement in the near future. But it is still a lot of fun.

I got this for my 9 yr old son for his Christmas gift. And while I know Oculus is affiliated with Meta/Facebook, I don’t like the fact that in order to use the toy - you HAVE to have an active Facebook account. Not a throw away account like I wanted to set up.While my son loves the oculus, I find the cost of the games you can buy to be super expensive. So it makes the ability to get him a variety of games difficult. $30 on average is a tough pill to swallow after paying $300 for the device.But my biggest gripe is having to have a Facebook account to have access to the device. I believe they’re going to change it. I still hate it cause I hate Facebook.You should have an option to set up access without having Facebook. Period.Take that away? The Oculus is a good purchase since my son loves it.

I was skeptical, but my son wanted one. It is way better than you might think. I ended up getting one for myself. I can play games like mini golf with my son when he is at his mothers house. I use it mainly for exercise (supernatural) on which I am totally hooked. Best exercise innovation in a decade without a doubt. It is just so fun you don’t feel hardly any effort of getting your heart rate up to a level for aerobic fitness. In fact my main issue has been over exercising with it, even though I am pretty fit. I also use it for meditation. There are a number of apps for that. None are perfect but right now Tripp is the best. While the meditation apps don’t yet live up to the incredible production value of supernatural, nonetheless I am very impressed at how the immersive nature of VR helps shift me into a more meditative state much more rapidly and with much less effort than standard meditation - which I am quite experienced at. In summary, this is absolutely great value, great for connecting with friends and family members in multiplayer games, and most of all an excellent wellness tool for exercise and meditation. It definitely isn’t just for kids.

I've always wanted to get into Virtual Reality and the Quest 2 gave me a chance. The Quest 2 has helped me with covid restrictions as I'm a people person and being an adult with high functioning autism I can't wear face masks due to sensory issues, I can't get pixels sick or ketch anything from them. Being a furry I've always wanted a fursuit but due to my sensory issues I couldn't afford nor wear one. For some reason with the Quest 2 and VRChat I can finally enjoy my Virtual Reality life and real life.The Quest 2 has definitely helped make me a better person as I've been able to work with my communications skills and not be so shy around large groups of people. From a gaming aspect  I love the freedom of being wireless to play Beat Saber or any other game away from home the best part is if you have mobile hotspot and your game needs internet you can use your hotspot on your smartphone to play away from home. Always play in a shady preferably covered spot with the Gardian on. If it's to bright it can't track the hand controllers and could damage the Quest 2 cameras and burn the screen.I've done alot of research on the Quest 2 before I spent the money. The price point to get into VR with the Quest 2 was great compared to pc only based VR heasets which also need a high power gaming PC to work.. The Quest 2 is completely  standalone it absolutely does not need a PC to use it, it does require a Facebook account to use.The ability for the Quest 2 to be used with a PC to play PC based VR games with or without the Oculus link cable. Definitely love it being stand alone and the  wireless ability is the best. I definitely recommend getting a different headstrap though the one that comes with it can be painful to the back of your head due to the plastic adjustment things on the back of the strap.

I bought this expecting to connect to my Oculus account and share my library of compatible games I purchased for my Rift through the link cable. But since my Oculus account is tied to a different email address than my Facebook account that has been a nightmare sorting out. After communicating with Oculus Support for a few hours they have stopped responding and my account is not working still. It has been well over 8 hours since any communication from them. I wish Facebook didn't ruin Oculus, but now I guess I can move onto another platform such as HTC after I make the return.

Man, ready player one? Like I’m there once we get there ykno? And I know we’re not going to be there anytime soon but I really been wanting to try out VR; so I decided to cop one. I’d recommend, if you don’t already use VR and know your eye distance to get an app that does, because positioning this is key to a great experience.I gave it 3 stars because of the system setup between this and oculus on pc(it being two different entities) and well, maneuvering through the menu when you’re at the main menu is really laggy and choppy(I’m on 1Gbps connection) games get laggy too, it’s just overall pretty laggy and booting up after having it for like over a month now(and turning completely off after each use) it’s REALLY slow and then once in I have to wait, and wait, and wait until I can turn guardian back on because surprise it can’t be found and so like by the time I’m actually able to launch and play a game from the time I turn it on, I would say legit a 10 minute ordeal. It’s cool tho, and some games are legit, so I mean I’m only here to write this and let y’all know, I still will play it.

I was so excited to grab this when it was on sale during Black Friday.As soon as I got it, I downloaded all of the free games as well as the sideloaded games. It was such a cool experience to be able to put a headset on and become a soldier, shooting and reloading realistically with the controllers.. playing Star Wars.. you already know what I mean.But I noticed about a month of 1 hour play per day, I would take off the headset, look at my hands, and my brain would ""lag"" almost and make me feel like I was looking at my VR hands. This got progressively worse (my brain would take longer and longer to ""reset""). And with Zuckerberg asking churches to join VR, businesses, I see this as a sly ""harmless"" way that he is pushing his agenda... nothing good can come from messing with your brain/mind to the point where it gets confused if it's reality or VR- and who's to say we're not already in a simulation??

Aside from the short battery life (2-3 hrs. at most), the headset performance is overall great, it does what it's meant to. As the only real standalone headset on the market, especially at the price point, it's not a bad buy.However, the issues are with the accessories, those that come with it and those you have to buy separately.First, the default headset strap is small, uncomfortable, and not very adjustable. Yet the official ""elite strap"" that offers better comfort and adjustability has had issues with breaking easily with normal use, even after they claimed to have fixed the problem.Next, the controllers (usually the left controller, which often is used to control character movement in games) have an issue called 'Drift'. Eventually the joysticks will stop working properly, and will start to get stuck moving in a specific direction or move in the opposite direction that you are trying to go. This makes many games completely unplayable, and also makes it hard to even navigate the main menu.They are aware of this issue, and have yet to do anything to fix it. Instead you can supposedly get a new controller if you contact them through the official support page. I've done this several times now though, and haven't gotten a response.If you try to replace it yourself, you cannot use any other controllers from other VR headsets, it has to be this specific type. They cost $69 on the oculus/meta site, and you'll be lucky if they are ever in stock.Lastly is the extra accessory you have to buy to use the headset with a vr-ready PC, the Link Cable. While I haven't seen any issues with the official cable, at the insane price point it isn't worth it, as you can buy other third party cables for under half the price. And they work just the same, there is no benefit to getting the expensive official cable.I after I got my headset, I purchased the accessories made by a company called Kiwi, they were highly recommended online, and I haven't had any issues with their products. That is my suggestion, but other companies' accessories will probably work as well.

Was there a Quest or a Quest 1? I don't think so. Why did FB/Meta start at 2? I have no idea. Maybe there was a Quest 1 and it ended up on the scrapheap for some reason and we never saw it.Anyway, the BIG NEWS with the Quest 2 is that you no longer need to hook up to a laptop/PC and so no longer need an expensive graphics card. The Oculus Rift cost about the same if a bit more than the Quest 2, but to operate it, you needed a graphics card that would set you back at least several hundred dollars. Worse than that, though, that required you to have a higher end PC, so instead of, say, a $500 Dell Inspiron, you were looking at having to have, say, a $2,000 Dell XPS. That was a major roadblock to mass availability of VR that FB/Meta took away by introducing the Quest 2 and putting the Rift out to pasture.Now that all sounds very 5 stars, and maybe it should be, so why am I only giving 4 stars?1. It's not as cool as I thought it'd be and I don't use it as much as I thought I would. The games/apps cost between $9.99 and $39.99, from what I've seen, but even the most popular game, Beat Saber for $29.99, which is kind of like Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) but with a light saber, isn't that cool, even if on paper it sounds cool. It's not bad, just kinda meh.2. I don't know if it's my head or my eye placement or what, but I have a real issue with eyes strain using it and, most of all, with getting double vision I can't resolve no matter what I do, namely repositioning the headset and adjusting how far apart lenses inside are. Now, I do wear glasses and thought it might've been because of that and because of the spacer for glasses wearers provided with the Quest 2 to allow extra room inside the headset for glasses, so since I can see OK without glasses, no like I'm blind or anything, I tried taking that spacer out and going without glasses, same thing. For whatever reason, I can see just as well without my glasses in the headset, so that's good, but the issue of eye strain and occasional double vision that I can't resolve is exactly the same.3. The spacer for eyeglasses leaves a small open space or gap between the spacer and the body of the Quest 2 along the nose such that if you glance down with your eyes, you can see outside, see light, and even when you don't, it lets outside light in, so that's poorly designed.4. You need a fairly large open space of floor with absolutely nothing on it or anything next to it, like walls, stuff on counters, shelves, etc. You can play with a smaller space, but you're constantly getting alerted by a big wall of plus signs that you're reaching the edge of your safe space. Now, one thing that's cool is if you leave the space, cross that wall of plus signs, you no longer see the game but get a black and white video feed of what's in front of you, of your surroundings, kinda like looking at your home through a low-res black and white security camera. Now, I do have just barely enough space, but the problem I run into is that you actually need a somewhat larger space since gameplay will often result in your arms that space, so if you've outlined a safe space or play area that's big enough but there's a counter, table, shelf, whatever not in it but right next to it, you will can find your hand knocking into whatever's on that counter, table, shelf, whatever and maybe knocking it off or over or whatever, so it seems like the easy solution for people who don't have big open areas of flat floorspace with nothing surrounding it in their homes would be to play it outside, which brings me to my next point...5. You can't play it outside. Nowhere in any of the instructions does it say you can't use it outside, like it literally won't work outside, so when I tried to use it outside, I thought it had broken. The headset has sensors all over it that must use the walls and ceiling to bounce off of, so when there are no walls or ceiling, it literally freaks out. The controllers work, sort of, but not really. Instead of seeing them in your hands, like you normally can with the headset on, you'll see the controllers 10 or 15 feet away all on top of each other, and you use the menu buttons and fire buttons, but you can't aim, or can only sort of aim because it thinks the hand controllers are 10 or 15 feet away and not positioned like you have them positioned. Now, it seems like with games like Pokemon Go and with so many people not having the rather large amount of space needed to use the Quest 2 that outside wood be a perfect solution, like in a park or in my backyard or in my driveway. When I googled it, I found out that my Quest 2 wasn't broken, but what I was reading was spinning it to be like it didn't work on purpose outside for my safety and not that it's a shortcoming of the Quest 2, which is what it totally is. One interesting thing that I did learn, though, is that the magnifying lenses in the Quest 2 should never be left in direct sunlight, not outside nor inside on a windowsill because if direct sunlight hits it, the sunlight hitting it will be like sunlight hitting a magnifying glass, only it'll focus it on the display screen inside and burn through it lickety-split. So that's A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW THAT'S NEVER MENTIONED IN THE MATERIAL YOU GET WITH THE QUEST 2 WHEN YOU BUY IT.Now that all may make it sound WORSE than it is. Those are my criticisms. Still, it's a pretty dang cool piece of tech, especially for the price. It's just not what I thought it'd be, so I'm going to be giving mine to my nephew.ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION: 64GB for $100 less vs. 128GB for $100 moreI spent the extra $100 and bought the 128GB one because I didn't want it going obsolete or running short on memory or whatever. If I had it to do all over again, I'd have saved myself the hundred bucks and bought the 64GB one, not because I'm giving it away but because there's no way you'd ever use 64GB, much less 128GB.What the storage is for isn't RAM, so it has no effect on performance, but is strictly for storing games, file storage. Each game, though, is only about 1GB, so before you'd ever use up 64GB, you'd have to have more than 60 apps/games on there. Setting aside that's around $1,800 in apps/games and just a crazy amount in my mind, even if you are that heavy a user and do have that much stuff, it doesn't matter because you can use a USB cable and put games you're not using or don't plan to use on a library that can store them on an app or even through a cell phone app on a cloud, so you'd only ever actually need more than 64GB and so pay the extra $100 for the 128GB version is if you actually want to have access to 60 to 120 games and apps all at the same time without having to swap games/apps out with others in your library. Now, you may be thinking of future-proofing, that there will come a time when the games/apps are 2GB or 3GB or 5GB or whatever and so don't want to be caught short, but you won't be, or you will be, but it won't matter. The reason games/apps are only around 1GB each is going much bigger than that would push or exceed the limits of the Quest 2's processors and internal RAM. That means that when down the road games/apps grow much larger than what they are now, it'll be time to upgrade from the Quest 2 to whatever's next. There's no avoiding that by spending an extra $100 for 128GB of onboard storage instead of 64GB. Now, when the Quest 2 first came out last year, it came out with only 32GB at the same price it is now with 64GB. 32GB wasn't enough storage, so FB/Meta quickly remedied that by making a 64GB for $100 more, but then it obsoleted the 32GB version and dropped the price of the 64GB to the same as what the 32GB one had been. FB/Meta then added the 128GB option because of people demanding it after panicking from the 32GB one not being enough that they thought 64GB wouldn't be either or soon wouldn't be. But it's totally unnecessary and a waste of $100. If you don't believe me, just research it for yourself. EVERYONE says so, and having lived it myself now, I fully agree.SAVE YOURSELF $100 AND BUY THE 64GB QUEST 2......BECAUSE YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NEVER EVER USE UP EVEN THE 64GB, MUCH LESS EVER NEED 128GB, AND IF YOU SOMEHOW WOULD EVER HAVE MORE THAN 64GB IN APPS/GAMES, YOU CAN SIMPLY STORE EXCESS LESSER USED APPS ON ANOTHER DEVICE/CLOUD THAT YOU CAN REDOWNLOAD THEM FROM SHOULD YOU EVER WANT THEM ONBOARD YOUR QUEST 2 AGAIN LATER, BECAUSE THAT 64GB IS JUST ONBOARD STORAGE CAPACITY, NOT TOTAL STORAGE CAPACITY, WHICH WITH A PC/CLOUD, SKY'S THE LIMIT.

So, I'm new to this VR equipment and I've used this for about 2 months now and I must say I am astonished by how awesome it is. Great amount of content on the oculus store and so much fun for everyone.There are several things I noticed that got a little irritating at first so I am writing this to let others know to save them from the frustration.- If you are new to this type of experience, you will unavoidably feel motion sickness. It was hard for me to get through at first but after a few days or attempts of playing, I adapted to it pretty well to where it does not bother me anymore. Best thing to do is to make sure you have a way to cool yourself down while  you are using it (perhaps a fan) and take frequent breaks.- If you have bangs, be sure to move them out the way of your forehead. It interferes with the sensor. Often the screen would turn black in the middle of gameplay and I would readjust the headset only to realize it was my hair being in the way of the sensor that would cause the screen to go black.- When creating a guardian, I emphasize creating a GOOD play space because there are several times where I have hit something even if wasn't inside the play space. You'll be warned about stepping out of your boundary but not if any object is in the way.-The controllers comes with AA batteries but unfortunately you would have to replace them at some point. There is a rechargeable product that is pretty expensive so my method of recharging the controllers is through the use of rechargeable batteries.-From what I know, you need to play in the light, as there is no way the VR would be able to detect your surrounding if lights were off.There are things I have noticed and I hope to whoever read this find this information useful.

The headset is very durable. It, and the controllers have repeatedly been thrown to the floor, after FS2020 wouldn't work properly, but that's mostly down to my graphics card only being a GTX970. That's the lower limit of what can run VR, on a PC. Nothing broke, amazingly. Only the battery covers on the controllers popped off, along with the Elite head strap. All of these were easy to reset.If you're on a low end PC, be sure to run X-Plane11, or 12, and avoid FS2020, until you get a better PC.The airlink feature works fairly well, but could do with some improvements. Be sure you have the right wi-fi to handle Airlink properly.The battery life is a tad short, and could've been a bit better, as far as battery life goes. At least, you can get a head strap with battery for extended play.The adjustable spacing between the lenses (lateral) is a plus, and I highly recommend you check your inter-pupalary-distance (IPD), to be sure you don't encounter discomfort when playing.My only main complaint is, if you have low vision, you may not be able to read the smallest text in menus., even after setting the fonts to ""Largest""Be sure to use the spacer, if you wear glasses. You don't want your glasses grinding over the headset's lenses.I do enjoy being able to download, and play games, directly to the Quest 2. I think there needs to be a lot more game development. Being able to play games from the PC is also great.The audio is very good, and it took me a while to figure out where the audio was coming from. It's very well hidden.The field of vision in the Quest 2 leaves a bit to be desired. It's only about 90 degrees. It's even tighter, if you use the eyeglass spacer.If you only see with one eye, you won't be able to see in 3D, but you'll still be able to enjoy playing in VR.After about a couple of months, I have noticed my device takes about 4 or 5 restarts, before it lets me go into the main menu.

For years I had contemplated a VR headset, but was hesitant.  I had not know anyone else who owned one, so I had no word of mouth to go off of.  I finally bit the bullet and gave this a try.From moment one, I was very impressed with the quality of the device and the VR environment.  Setting up an area was simple, and helped keep me safe. To those who are not aware, the device has you set up a square or circle area to play in.  You set it up with the device, in an area free and clear of obstacles.  Any time you step out of the area, you can literally see through the device into the world outside the VR headset (in black and white), letting you know you are outside the safe zone, and showing you where you are physically so you don't hurt yourself.  I had NO idea that was a feature, and it is truly awesome that this is available as a safety feature.  No walking into walls or into coffee tables!The VR world itself is pretty impressive.  There are a few tutorials you can run through to learn how to operate in the world.  There are ways you can ""Pick up items"" using the controllers, that felt weird at first, but became second nature.  You can even set it up so that you can use your actual hands and fingers to navigate and select items, free from the controllers.There are a few games you can play for free, as well as a few free videos that will take you to places you never thought possible.  Many of the games for purchase are under $30.You can set up your netflix or amazon prime, and watch your favorites in the VR world.On the whole, I am extremely impressed with the Oculus Quest.  I am already planning on purchasing more to give as gifts, so that I can interact with friends and family in the VR world.

Order a different strap while you're at it. The original is pathetic and uncomfortable. Downloading was slow and updates maddening with our old provider, but most games can be played solo without the connection after download.Otherwise, wow! I even watch Netflix on it while dh is watching sports. There's lots of games and things to do (ping pong, racquet ball type game, boxing, Adventure games...). The best part is playing a game with family who lives 1800 miles away. It's like being in the same room as we laugh, talk, and play.THREE MONTHS LATERI spend WAY too much time on VR. The headset still looks like new, even though I use it daily. I am very careful with it. One evening it wouldn't turn on. Checked original order to look for warranty info (3 months and a few days after purchase) and used the link for ""Included Amazon Support."" Entered phone number, got a call in just a couple minutes. The person was a bit difficult to understand, but for the most part sounded like he was listening rather than just reading/repeating prepared script. I'm guessing there is no specific product knowledge, but after several attempts to revive unit (black screen) a return was arranged and a new headset is due to arrive in 4 days. I will check new box for warranty info. to be sure the next one doesn't wait until expired. If I have any issues downloading all the purchased apps, I'll append this review.Yes there are ways the headset could have been better. It is front heavy and it's difficult to imagine they couldn't do better, but that's probably part of planned obsolescence. The original set up did not flow intuitively, and ultimately did not get the referral credit. I don't like having fb linked, but use the various settings so it isn't telling everyone when I'm playing nor reporting to my wall. I don't like having limited sources for purchasing games, but plenty of folks seem to think that's ok with apple. With all it's shortcomings, I still highly recommend this. I've never been ""a gamer"" so perhaps my expectations are different from those that find this system intolerable. But I've ""met"" some great folks on line (some not so great too), had fun with family, and really enjoy the system.

Basically said, too bad, your fault, here is a link to our great products that are at a great price"". Imagine that, ""hey too bad you aren't getting your $50, here is a link to bunch of stuff that you dont want and didn't ask for, spend more money on our website while we laugh in your face"".Insulting in many ways!

I picked this up for my teenage son as a Christmas present. I was a bit concerned about the internet connection, since we live very rural and have only a very, very slow connection. But this works without a problem.The headset is, thanks to the straps, adjustable to a wide range of head sizes. It doesn't pinch the hair or rub or feel uncomfortable. The viewer fits around my younger daughter's head all the way up to my husband's very large one. There is a built-in cushion around the area it rests on the face, which keeps it from rubbing or irritating. The nose area, unfortunately, isn't nearly as 'all fitting' and is rather large. My son does find it sometimes distracting, since he can glimpse a tiny bit of the 'real' world when glancing down. There is also an extra accessories which is placed in the headset for those who wear glasses. I've tried it with and without this extra piece, but didn't have trouble with my glasses either way. The handheld controllers are comfortable in the hand, have buttons which are easy to reach, and work very well. These do have wrist straps, which work very well, too.On to the games and usage! I'm not tech-savvy, so things have to be pretty basic for me to use them. This headset is no problem. It came mostly charged and ready to go. It's pretty self-explanatory with the menus easy to see and use when the visor is on. It took about 2 hours for the installation to download and install...but that's thanks to our very, very, very slow connection. And we found that fast (so that tells you how quick it'd be on 'normal' connections). It took a bit to flip through all of the menu options and included apps to see what is there and what not. We did need to download the games, but this was no problem. There are free ones and variously priced ones, giving something for every direction and budget. Once downloaded, the games work easily with or without internet connection (depending on the game, I assume). We got the basic memory one and it has more than enough space for us.The headset battery usage lasts about 2 to 4 hours, but this depends on what games are being played as well as the screen brightness and such. So, it can vary. The hand controllers, of course, hold longer, but believe it or not, these are NOT rechargeable. They use standard AA.Clear some room space when using this. It does have an awesome mapping out application, which the kids loved to use and roam through the house with. And the games to have the player 'draw' the borders first. Watch flailing arms, though (we did have some accidental whacking of innocent family members going on). It is fun. Tons of fun. Some of my relatives, who tried it out for a few minutes because...who wouldn't?...did experience a bit of a headache after 5 or so minutes of play or had a bit of dizziness. I didn't have a problem nor do my kids, though.I'm glad we picked this up, one for both of my kids at home, and they do play together (they can chat through the headsets and such as well). Oh, and my son has streamed Netflix through it and said that it's an odd experience as well.

Great standalone set.  The older models 64 GB was a bit too small in storage.  This 128 GB is plenty of room to house a good number of games.  I currently have 75 GB free of 128, and have RE4, Saints and Sinners, Climb 2, Thrill of the Fight, All three Vaders, Wander, Brink, VR Fishing, and golf+ loaded.The Quest does take some getting used to.  I got nauseous the first time I used it for any length of time.  But eventually you get used to it.  Everything works as intended.  And the controllers are pretty accurate and responsive.  Headset isn't heavy to be uncomfortable.  But thank goodness the battery only lasts an hour or two, or you could be down the rabbit hole for a while and not even know it.Quest store though has a lot to be desired.  You really have to research games on your own.  Very few have trial versions where you can try a small portion to see if you like it.  The search for games is really basic in the store.  It seems they will really push certain games.  And it gets hard to navigate.  Really, in the store, you either know what you want and can search it, or good luck finding anything.  Unfortunately, this means you have to rely on third party review sites.  Which means they are recommending what they like, not what you may be looking for.  This really puts smaller and niche games at a disadvantage, as most of these review sites look at the same best games.Also the desktop program store and the store on the quest are the same, but different.  You have to watch out what you are buying, and make sure it's for the right product.  You can go to the Oculus store, and have only the Quest 2 as your device, and they will still bring up products for the Rift and Quest.  And if you accidentally buy them, you are SOL.  So it's best just to stick to the store on the Quest 2.  And as I said before, the Quest 2 has very few trials.  Most everything is buy to play.  And once you buy, there are no returns.The big plus for the desktop though is that if your PC can handle it.  For lack of a better term, you can stream a game onto your quest from the PC.  Controllers won't work, and you have to use the keyboard on most.  But I hear it transforms some desktop games.  And with recent updates, you can do it without tethering.Overall, despite a lot of quirks and issues.  It's been worth it.  VR still isn't where it should be.  But the Quest 2 is a big step in the right direction, in both affordability and what it gives you.

I've been wanting to pick up a VR headset for years, having always been fascinated by it and having tried it once in a VR demo room and was blown away by the immersive feel. But I didn't because it was intimidating, I didn't want to get a gaming PC, I didn't want to figure things out like ""boundaries"" or such, and I was worried it was still not mainstream enough for a casual non-techie person to be able to use it.But now that I finally decided to buy a unit and try it out, can I just say, that the Oculus Quest 2 is absolutely amazing. Being able to play anywhere without wires is liberating, and the setup was surprisingly easy and straightforward that a non-techie person can easily do it. The available library of games is very impressive, and I've been amazed at how some simple games (like Tetris) can feel so gorgeous when in a VR environment.Besides games, my favorite thing about this headset is the ability to do some amazing (and intense) workouts on it. I've always found it hard to stick to exercise because I find it boring, but man oh man, it is not boring in VR! I was worried the headset would be too heavy and make exercise problematic, but it wasn't. I'm not going to say the headset is light or that you can't feel it, but that once you get to work, you don't really notice it that much, and the amazing experience you get is more than worth it.Between casual games and fitness games (and games that mix both) I've been absolutely impressed, and am completely in love with the Oculus Quest 2. The only con I can think of is ... I wish they had either more storage, or that you can put in a Micro SD card. I feel like even the 256 GB unit I got will not hold what I want eventually, and I'd have to delete things I don't use. It's not a huge problem, but if I can think of a con, that's it.

Pros:Cool new experience of the next big thing. It's exciting to just be apart of it.Speakers are amazing and you do not need headphones. I would like to see an add on subwoofer though in the future.Great entry price to get into this new universe.Cons:Headset is way too big, it's front heavy, the straps aren't comfortable. The size and weight needs to be majorly reduced. It's the same exact size as my first unit 7 years ago.Not many games, apps, and experiencesNo playable demos to try it before you buy it.No haptic feedback in the goggles.Image quality is the same as my unit 7 years ago, can still see pixelization in details, not crisp enough.Most apps have cartoonist graphics.  If you want xbox/Playstation VR you're only going to get super NES Mario Brothers VR for most all apps and games.  Haven't see. Unreal engine type graphics anywhere.Battery life is 1.5 hours which isn't very good.Nearly everything costs money. In the first 2 days I spent $150 on games and apps.  Good games are $40.Can't use Bluetooth headphones or surround speakers as the latency is too slow.No Color passthrough video, it's grainy black and white video.IOI opps I mean Facebook forces you to have a fb account and controls everything here. It's fine because it makes integration seemless, but I still don't like that you can't opt out even if you wanted to.Conclusion:There are any improvements that are needed but I still would recommend getting this.  Oculus pro cones out in May and Oculus 3 comes out in 2023. So if you are reading this before August 2022 than get this unit, if after that then wait for the next generation. It will be lighter and smaller for sure. In the future we'll look back at the quest 1 like how we look back at blackberry phones.

I was pretty excited to get the OQ2 after hearing about it.  I had high hopes of losing myself in the metaverse and immersing myself in other worlds.  Kind of hard to do when you're constantly annoyed because everything is out of focus.  I've tried with glasses, without glasses.  I've tried adjusting for IPD, pupillary distance (how far apart your eyes are) but with only 3 settings I can't get it right for me.  I constantly have to adjust the goggles on my face to get even just the center in focus.  The graphics are weak in most games, in fact most of the games feel and look like Wii games from almost 20 years ago.  Watching even the highest resolution videos are a disappointment too.  Very grainy and pixelated.I'm returning this.  Total disappointment.

A Fantastic idea to purchase for a early Christmas gift to my lady an myself. This is by far my favorite purchase of 2021 and play almost more then my PS5. Amazing games, some are a Lil off the wall but fun and affordable! I even bought some games and was able to return them full return back to my card. You will need to upgrade some parts to help with the experience but Amazon got tons of accessories for the oculus quest 2. Did get the 3 year warranty and we have kids so we supervise when using. Very pleased with my purchase.

Beware if you wear glasses.  I followed directions on how to set up the headset but never could get it comfortable.  After several uses, I started noticing a haze in the VR screen.  It turns out my glasses were rubbing against the headset lenses and both were getting scratches. Weight of headset contributed to neck pains. Also, it was difficult to keep eyes focused so I kept getting headaches.  This may be related to the geometry of the optics, shape of my face, etc.  Not worth the trouble to resolve.  Better to go outside and enjoy actual reality.  Bad outweighs the good for me.  So now I'm out the cost of 1 game, 1 subscription and cost to replace my glasses lenses.The good:  I enjoyed Beat Saber as a game.  I thought it would be good cardio but not really.  I'm not really into games so it got boring very quickly.  Adult content was ok except close ups I could not focus.  Also, there's the issue of logistics not being able to see your hand.  LOLVR is just not for me, at least not until technology gets better.

So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.My real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.You have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.For instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.An app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience.  I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.The travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.Another problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.I'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.People complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.Also, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.So I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.

Once we purchased the virtual gaming console my son was eager to add games to his account.  Well thats when everything went bad.We purchased gift cards to use for this purpose and as soon as he entered the card numbers the funds were used before he could click to purchase the games.  He had been robbed online!  Someone in AZ stole his gift cards!This happened not once, but twice.I contacted Oculus support online and after 3-days of sending them details, screenshots of the account, etc.  they told us to contact the bank. They did nothing!We lost $75 on their unsecured web site via the app.  They suck!Now, my 12 year son is so disappointed.  That was his money he earned helping family members over Xmas break.Think twice before purchasing this console it's more of a headache than what it's worth.

Maybe I got a defective HP headset but I had to constantly make micro adjustments and the eye's had to be lined up perfectly to not get a fuzzy image. Event then most of the surrounding lens was putting out fuzzy images. I would get stuck in VR Mode on my Desktop and after force closing anything related too VR It would still be there.I would have to force log to get control of my mouse back because the Hotkey would not work anymore after getting stuck like that. VR Editing mode didn't work at all in the Unreal Engine (I'm a developer), I would be far too high up and my controllers wouldn't work.I had nothing but trouble with that headset all around it was horrible.I decided to buy an Oculus Quest 2 and I absolutely do not like the fact that you 'Have to pair it with your phone'. I really dislike the fact that you absolutely have to log in to Facebook on your phone and pair it in order to use the headset. If it weren't for that I would give 5 stars. The instant I put it on Everything was crystal clear unlike the over priced bulky/heavy HP headset I had.I didn't have to adjust the lenses and I was surprised that people would say text is easier to read on the HP then the Quest because that doesn't seem to be the case in fact with the HP headset I had to be looking directly at something or it would be very fuzzy and out of focus and the Quest doesn't have that issue at all...it could be to the side and still come in clear.

I began my VR journey 2 months ago. I did some research prior to purchasing of different VR headsets, and the Oculous Quest 2 seemed liked the logical winner. The price for refresh rates offered and the visual quality was a no brainer; I thought. Never-mind that Facebook is attached to it. So for one month I have had in my possession the Quest 2.I will outline my experience here as a PC Gamer, and I'll try to keep it brief. What it's going to come down to is the duration at which you game. I haven't tried VR in any AAA titles, first person shooters. My primary reason for entering VR was for the flight simulator DCS World, which does support VR, but is not really graphically optimized for either AMD nor Nvidia.I started with a 5700 XT graphics card - which you can have an OK VR experience with. Enters the cable issue. Now, there are a very limited number of cables manufactured that can meet the data requirements for the Quest 2, IF you choose not to buy Oculous's OFFICIAL $expensive cable. I tried a few - get the official cable. And I might note; you do want the official cable. Skip the thought you are going to have an amazing PC gaming experience over WiFi data.Problem 2: Powering the headset while gaming. Now that you have the official cable AND even though you have USB 3.1/Gen 1 or 2 TYPE A - You need a USB adapter for type C. There are only a couple produced that actually provide enough data throughput to have an OK VR experience.The duration: It really depends on how long you play. For an online flight sim where missions take hours for one mission - the battery dies. Then you have to disconnect from the online server, switch back to your monitor; it becomes a whole ordeal.The solution: A USB type C PCIe 3.0 x 16 adapter card. And there are only a few manufactured that can actually provide enough power to charge the Quest 2 as you game. StarTech is one of them sold here at amazon to save you some trouble. Now, comes the other problem. Do you have enough room with your graphics card air cooler to use your other PCIe x16 (whatever gen) slot? Fortunately I did, so I got the adapter card.This part has nothing to do with the Quest 2 itself...You are enjoying your VR experience so you lay down a chunk of change to amplify that with a new modern graphics card like a 3080. If you don't put a water block on it - you lose your ability to use your PCIe 16x adapter. Why? Because the air coolers are 2.5 to 2.7 card slot widths to cool it. So you buy a riser cable to use the adapter...see where I'm going with this?So, back to the original problem - providing power to the headset so it's actually useful. The crux is the battery. Over time it's not going to hold a charge and your ability to game in VR is going to be less and less. - unless that adapter card or your motherboard can actually power the headset. My motherboard isn't too ancient (z370).So you spent $ for whatever it costs now - for a price/pixel ratio that is great, but is actually hot garbage in terms of functionality. Power.  Then you spend more money $$$ on trying to provide a solution to the power problem. The visual clarity is good for VR. You can read text, make out dials etc. In the end it's meaningless.My final conclusion is what myself and other PC gamers should of done instead of trying to find a solution to Oculous's problem is save and buy a proper PC gaming VR headset.The End - Other specific functionality regarding the headset below.Tracking: For whatever reason it will lose tracking no matter if my room is lit or not.Data throughput: Using my USB 3.1 Type A connections with a usb to c adapter works ok and it does achieve the data throughput required for VR - the Quest 2 doesn't like it at all. I have experienced graphics deterioration and strange blinking during head turning movement. This is to the point of having to exit the game and restart the game itself or restart the Quest 2. This is using a GeForce 3080. The only good experience I have had graphically is using a Type C adapter card and the only slot that can provide ample throughput is perhaps a PCIe 3.0 16x slot.Controllers: ""Where is the second controller - you must have it!"" For the majority of VR things I use only one controller, including gaming. My primary game controllers are an xbox style controller for PC and HOTAS for flight sims. Quest 2 will be like ""But where are MY controllers? They all must be active!"" You will receive controller notifications and sometimes while watching a movie you will have your controller your NOT using pop up in the middle of the movie screen.The guardian: Quest 2, ""Set your guardian! No, really set it again...hey can you set that guardian up!?"" The guardian is your virtual to real world play area. I primarily use stationary. You will set it, then you will have to set it again and again.My final overall thoughts for the Quest 2 is that it's a toy. It's an entry into the VR arena. The software platform and overall experience is perhaps built for the general masses to experience VR. Your VR experience will be of quality, but with limited time.* Other problems- Since switching to the USB port on my motherboard after an hour or so of play the bottom half of the video (gaming) pixelates and corrupts. I have not found a solution to this.I have found an active usb cable with an external power source can keep the quest 2 charged while playing.

PC Gamers Beware; Review written for the Arm Chair Warriors

I really like it, it was quite a large purchase for a game system VR (to me) and so what I did was, I bought a phone holder type of headset (the third picture is the one I bought) to kind of gauge if I’d actually use a VR headset and enjoy it or if it would turn into a coffee table paper weight. Well I enjoyed the cheap one enough that I ended up buying this. I’ve had it about a week so far, I’ve purchased Resident Evil 4 for it, and have been watching movies on it. RE4 is really good, as I played that originally on a GameCube almost 20 years ago, it was awesome playing it as a VR game. My biggest gripe is that it loses Wi-Fi connection pretty consistently, I have a Nighthawk Wi-Fi router (500mb/S speed) that’s only about 3 months old, and none of my other devices lose connection so I’m sure it’s the headset. I also don’t like that I can’t use wireless headphones with it, or at least I can’t seem to find a way to pair them. The battery life isn’t that great, but to be honest, for the hardware your paying for that’s a small price to pay. Despite those (small) issues, All in all, if you’ve been wanting a VR system , this is the best bang for buck tech that you can get right now. I’d highly recommend it to anyone, the first time you put it on, you will be impressed.

Pros -- Immersive VR- Great initial experience(after you get over the setup) for those who haven't experienced VR beforeCons -Where to begin?- Setup requires you MUST have a phone connected through BT with at least Android 5.0+- Even with an Android 5.0+, setup didn't recognize the phone and vice versa- Customer support was clueless to the issue that's been reported as early as 2020 in THEIR Forums!- Very critical things cannot be done on the VR set itself but require a phone at all time such as store refunds, VR setup (in case you reset it) and basically most things involving your account.I had no idea I need to buy a set and a phone to go with it so I can use the set.Maybe FB should sell the VR set with a compatible phone, this is ridicules.- Eventual Solution by Oculus support was to actually borrow a phone from a friend, setup my 400$ white brick until that point so I can finally use it, a week after I received the set.- Pricing of Games/Apps on the different stores is up the roof.For example - 30$ for Beat Saber for really basic tracks and an additional 10-15$ for every 5 tracks from any actual known artists. It probably costs around 500$ to get all DLC songs beat saber currently offers which is insane.- Not enough quality games in the store, most Apps/Games offer very similar experiences and challenges.- Games graphics is not what it should be in 2022.All things considered - a nice gimmick of a VR platform to show your family and friends how cool VR is and then store it somewhere and wait until a proper game/app comes out or they fix their pricing.

I really wanted to love this since my boyfriend has an occulus and loves it. For starters, the fit is not ideal. I found that it was blurry and really wasn’t clear regardless of where I positioned the headset or how I moved the lenses. Then I could still see through the nose to the floor because it’s so much larger than my face. On top of that, it was so heavy it just made the entire experience uncomfortable and not enjoyable.

Update: Facebook did refund my bundle purchased in error. They also have been very good at keeping in touch via email. It was still frustrating, but i do love VR.I received this as a birthday present. I have really enjoyed using it. However, when I tried to use it the second day, I was shown a screen that wanted me to log in. When I tried, it came up with an old email address which I don’t have access to anymore. It would not let me change the email address. It also allows one to login using Facebook However it would not accept my password. After conversations with three ‘support agents’, I gave up. Then, quite by accident, I discovered I could login using the iPad app. I had asked it I could use it to log in, but was ignored. Then, being an inexperienced user, I ordered a bundle of games. When I installed  the first of 3 I discovered that it needed me to be able to move around. So, since I had seen Oculus had a good refund policy, I tried to get a refund. The website denied my refund and said I could chat with an agent. When I got the agent online, he told me that they don’t refund bundles. I explained I was handicapped and confined to a chair. He said”most people research before buying”. That was not a very friendly response. My advice is to be aware that you are on your own. I’m 77 years old. One would think I would know better then to trust “Meta”, which now owns Oculus.

After putting in some time to read reviews on some top tech sites about the best VR headset to purchase, I made this purchase pretty enthusiastically. Fast-forward two days and I just as enthusiastically returned it.The graphics feel straight out of the Nintendo Wii era. The top-rated games are pixelated and give no sense of immersion. There's stuttering in the menu animations. The whole thing feels like the headset's hardware is struggling to run graphics from years ago. It feels buggy and incomplete and very dated.That being said, the controls are great and there are some really cool features that would make this an amazing unit if the hardware was amped up a bit. I love the ability to draw the boundaries of your playing area, and the ""guardian"" wall it projects to keep you safe while playing. I still can't figure out how it remembered the boundaries of my playing area in my living room after I turned the headset off and took it to another room before bringing it back.

Only after 2 weeks the item started having an issue called boot loop which means the item is trying to boot up but won’t. Oculus support is terrible. They don’t let you call them by phone only chat and email. I contacted them and they couldn’t fix it over the phone. I waited almost a week and finally they said I had to ship it to them and once they receive it they will investigate it and then determine whether they should send me a refurbished one even though I bought one brand new. And it could take 3 weeks for me to get another. They never offered any kind of retribution for the hardship. So I contacted Amazon to complain and they took care of the problem right away. I had a brand new oculus in 2 days. Amazon is awesome but don’t waste your time with the Oculus people they are horrible with customer service.

I’m not “a gamer”—last console I owned was a PlayStation2—but have to say I love this headset. VR is the future not only of gaming, but of everything! Grandiose, I know, but this environment opens up so many possibilities—as did the internet before it.Anyway, back to the Oculus 2 headset. Drawbacks: as a mobile device, it’s limited in the resolution of it visuals. It doesn’t have the processing power to render as sharply as a console or PC. That said, the immersive experience is provides is breathtaking. Also, limited battery power means you can only play a couple hours or so before needing to plug it in again to charge.And for now, you do need a Facebook account to use it; that is evil on so many levels, there shouldn’t even be a need to elaborate.The pros, however, outweigh these limitations. As the de facto heavyweight of VR, the Oculus Quest (or Meta Quest, as Zuckerberg wants you to call it) offers a huge library in every genre. And it’s growing. Yes, the majority seem to be about shooting zombies, shooting soldiers, or beating the crap out of people (and there are excellent entries in those categories). But you’ll also find puzzle games, dancing games, fitness, educational, social, and family fun titles.I use it primarily to stay active and burn calories. The Move app counts calories burned while wearing the headset. When you’re slashing monsters with a sword or going toe-to-toe with boxing opponents, you barely notice you’re exercising!As others have noted, the stock Oculus needs some aftermarket upgrades to make it comfortable—headstrap replacement, silicon sweat shield. All fair points.Is this the BEST VR headset available? No. Is it the best VR headset AND experience available, for $300? In 2021-22 at least, yes. This will be the product that finally brings VR to the masses. If you want to see what VR is all about, and don’t mind the creepy Facebook factor, the Quest 2 should provide tons of enjoyment.

So, lets get right to it. The battery life on these vr headsets don't last very long. Maybe, just maybe an hour of playtime before your battery is low and you have to charge it. And that depends on what you are playing or doing with the headset. I understand they are headsets, not meant to last long but, it be nice if they at least last 2 hours at most. Then I would mind the whole take of and recharge them.Onto the heat issue. These things get do get a little warm after a while. And they can get hot if you are playing a very active game where you are moving a lot. Would've been nice to have some sort of better cushions for where the headset meets your head at. Because the cushion/spacers that come with the headset are not good at all. Don't get me wrong they are semi comfortable, I will give them that but, besides the semi comfort part, they don't help with keeping your face cool. Might have to look into aftermarket cushions for that area. Maybe some cushions that have a cool gel inside of them. Maybe that'll work, maybe.Overall though, I am happy with my purchase as VR is getting more and more popular now an days. Oh, the price also for these are good especially since you have some high ends headsets out there that have the same components and visuals and such.Recommend getting this headset if your looking to start getting into VR. Unless you save up for a more pricier and high end VR headset.

Purchased the Oculus for Christmas present and the left controller has had a constant issue with not staying connected. Tried to a replacement left controller sent under warranty- which means nothing and oculus refuses to send one. We did everything Terrence from Oculus support suggested which did not fix the issue. And suggested we purchase a replacement instead of Oculus and Mark Suckaturd sending a replacement for the out of the box faulty controller.

A stand alone headset for a fraction of the cost of other models and you don't need a gaming pc or link cable to run decent games (but you still have the option if you want). Honestly just having RE 4 oculus quest 2 exclusive would have been enough to convince me to buy it if I didn't already have it. Pretty decent battery life. I personally don't have any issues with vr sickness. I know some friends have, but they were able to get over it pretty quickly with limited exposure and ginger root. I highly recommend this headset. I'm hooked and don't even want to touch a regular console anymore. The stuff you can do in VR is just incredible! I am looking forward to see how it improves in the future (fingers crossed SAO lvl experience lol)

As long as the device is running, it is a cool device. It is smooth and pretty neat. Battery lasts pretty good too. Until it doesn't work. One day it just said that my WIFI password was wrong. I have multiple devices still connected and working just fine. I tried the modem/router resetting, the Oculus devices and app resetting and reinstalling, and no change.So the device is great, until you need support. Then it just goes downhill from there. Support people are nice, but their chat keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. I would rate Oculus device/app support up there with the TOP WORST customer service/troubleshooting services I have EVER experienced. Also, this brand new device shouldn't be having these kinds of issues less than 6 months later with no easy solution. i have spent over an hour with support now with NO help except to keep telling me to reset my network connections when all my other devices work just fine and I even disconnected and reconnected multiple other devices and they all reconnected just fine too.

I started my journey into VR with an Oculus Rift S, that had many issues, mostly with my cord, that costs more than half the price of the headset to replace since FB stopped supporting the Rift S. When I bought this unit I was, for legitimate reasons, worried I might experience some issues. I did not. The Quest 2 runs PCVR better than my Rift S did, and it can also run games on it's own without my PC. As I do have a PC I opted for the lower gb version, since every game I own is off of steam for the most part. I will say that the stock strapping this comes with is some sort of miracle of modern science, the fact that it holds so tight with such a basic snap-on connection is crazy, but that strap is garbage. I'd recommend buying an upgraded halo for the Quest 2 immediately.

This tech in the next 20 years will be awesome. The thing to remember with Quest is who backs it Facebook, you need a Facebook account to even register it . That alone was killer for me, Facebook is terrible, Once you JUMP through all the hoops you can now feel free to set up a CC with this device. Everything cost money, it's a huge up sale market. Something's are free, but far too few.If you need to return this unit, you will pay over 20 bucks to do so .  It takes several weeks for the refund to be issued. It goes back to a special place in Lexington, Ky The tech is awesome, just not this unit.With games and all gear it will cost over 400.00 bucks, not worth the hassle and the vision issues if you wear glasses or contacts. If you're under 20 I bet you would love this. Any older and you see it's glaring flaws and ludicrous up sale design. The final straw was this modern unit doesn't support PLUG /PLAY a common software over 20 years old.. Welcome to the mind of Quest/Facebook to simply connect this to my PC to play with Steam I need to BUY more items imagine that ;-)

I love this headset. I purchased it specifically to use Supernatural, and it's totally worth, even it if that's all you do with it. I'm finding other apps that I enjoy also. Initially I had a problem with the guardian tracking; however, after an update, it seems to have mostly corrected itself. The ""mostly"" is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5. To be fair, I contacted Oculus support directly and they were very helpful and responsive and were going to allow me to send it back. There's a lot of reasons to me why that was a little scary and very inconvenient, but mostly because I'm paying for some subscriptions and the fear of how long it would take to get a replacement. I tested it out for a while before thinking I would send it back, but it has kept working. So, I'm keeping it. Hoping it doesn't die, now that I've missed my return window, but so far so good and it's absolutely worth it. Especially if you're like me and sit at a desk ALL day and want to exercise without anyone seeing you (or leaving your house).

First, you are required to connect your Facebook account in order to use this product.Second, my unit is not charging properly, before I ever turned it on I plugged it in overnight and it never fully charged.  I contacted Oculus now what is clearly a defective product, since a brand new product that has never even been turned on should certainly charge to 100%, but they want me to do resets, factory resets, delete accounts, reinstall accounts, etc.  How about you just replace the defective unit?  No, I have to go through all of their procedures before they will do anything.  Save yourself time and frustration and buy something besides this garbage.

**UPDATE** I requested a new one on Jan 18th, finally received the replacement on Jan 26th.It would have been much easier and faster to have originally purchased from the Oculus store.As of right now: delivered this morning 730 unboxed and charged, 10am first start: controllers would not track properly.  Set up through oculus app then it updated and restarted. Immediately after restart the screen tracking was all over the place rendering it useless.  After an hour in a chat window with oculus support we determined it was DOA. Replacement ordered now to wait 10-11 days for the ""prime shipping"" to get it here. Bonus though, if the new one works i got 15 bucks from oculus for my troubles and btw they offered a replacement too.

I've always wanted to try VR and finally sprung for the Quest 2. What is bad is that you need to use a Facebook account to set it up. There are a lot of games for the Q2 that range from free to fifty bucks. There are some free apps that are not interactive but very interesting, like a tour of the White House and a tour of the International Space Station in 360°. Or get a close up look at dinosaurs. Several free games are available, as well. My wife likes to fish with Bait. You may want to opt for an upgraded head strap as the included strap can be a little difficult to adjust, especially if you share the headset with another person.My wife says the screen is very sharp, but I've never been able to get it more than moderately sharp. My glasses do not fit well in the headset. The headset is kind of heavy. I wish I could compare this with the PlayStation VR. You may want to borrow your friend's Quest 2 if you get motion sickness easily to see if VR is for you.

A truly mesmerizing thing to behold. So much functionality and content in such a little thing, one look at the quest 2 and you’re itching your brain at how so much fits into there. To hold out your arm in a virtual world and see your arm stretch out digitally is unreal! Playing with a friend just adds icing to the cake for me, and even playing social games is quite entertaining. With the ability to watch movies, in a large virtual movie theater like you’re at a real cinema will never make you go to a theater again. Exercise, watch videos or movies, play terrifying or hilariously fun games, it’s all in the palm of your hands. You can even go somewhere far away, my choice was going to see the northern lights. Although for play it’s also a tool for work if need be, as there are free apps to download that can help your work life in any way. There are so many other functions I couldn’t possibly fit in this review. However I will add this: I received my headset and had faulty lenses that were blurry as hell, and had a replacement come that gave me the experience I paid for. Keep in mind that statement as it can happen to you as well, my replacement took about a week I believe and even came earlier than the tracker said.If you’re thinking about it..get it, trust me you’ll have a smile glued to your face the first second you see your virtual reality hands.

The headset itself is not bad.  As other reviews have stated, you'll almost certainly want to get an upgraded strap and maybe a battery pack.  If you wear glassed you'll need to buy lens protectors since for some reason the Quest 2 (unlike previous models), does not include them.The REAL negatives are Facebook related.  I have an FB account but I am not a big FB user.  I managed to have some fun for about two hours, after which the account link cause a verification lock on my Facebook profile.  Since Oculus forces account integration, losing access to FB means losing access to Oculus, purchases, settings, account, etc..  And since there is no Facebook support in existence anymore, not even Oculus support will do a damn thing to help you (I was told that even though they are both Meta, they apparently have no communication with each other).And so now I need to refute all my Oculus purchases via my credit card.  Rather than starting everything from scratch, I'm returning this dud until I find a better, non Meta, option.

I understand that this may just be my individual experience with my individual headset- but from day one, all I experienced with this thing was frustration. Firstly- they fail to tell you that you can’t use Oculus Link to play through your PC unless you have one of a very specific list of supported graphics cards, which is the main thing that I bought it for. I decided I could get over that and just use it as a standalone unit- then I noticed this strange green streak on the left lens. At first I thought it was a graphics error, but it persisted after several attempts to troubleshoot with Oculus support and to clean the lens. I received a partial refund for the defect from Amazon, and again decided that I could settle. About two weeks into my usage of the product, it would load into the blue “M” screen- then get stuck on the “…” screen while it played the main menu music and made sounds as I pointed the controllers around. The display was clearly stuck for some reason. I factory reset the device several times to try and fix this issue but it stayed on the “…” screen. At this point I threw my hands up and returned it all together. Extremely underwhelming and frustrating experience- it really felt like I was beta-testing an unfinished product that I payed full price for.

I bought this a few months ago and I can’t imagine going back to anything other than VR. That being said, this definitely needs a battery pack b/c it burns through charge. You get 2 hours max of play time regardless of what you’re doing. I bought the elite strap battery pack and that gives 2 hours exactly extra totaling a max of 4 hours. I think I’d prefer my own battery pack in hindsight to get more time but it’s easy to spend too much time playing. The second issue is memory. This works great for starters but it’s surprisingly easy to use everything. I have uninstalled games I already played so that I can play others. Unfortunately you can’t up the memory so you have to buy a whole different headset to bump up. Thirdly, I suggest using an anti-microbial spray for the foam face padding like the cpap cleaner sprays. It’s easy to sweat in these and the silicone makes horrible marks on my skin so cleaning it is best to stop break outs. But if you worry about breakdown then silicone covers are great.

The experience of a VR headset itself is great! I love what is capable of and using it, I have a pretty small player space but even so, I have been able to enjoy various games with the Quest 2 and the link cable.ABOUT JOYSTICK DRIFT:I am deeply concerned about the durability of the analog joysticks on the controllers, I have used this product for less than 20 DAYS, most of my playtime is Beat Saber (which does not even use the analog stick) and then around 10 to 15 combined hours of Pavlov and HL Alyx.It was while playing HL Alyx that I started noticing that sometimes my character was sometimes randomly moving to the right when I pushed the stick forward, initially I thought it was due to a faulty link connection, but I checked in the software calibration the joysticks, and surprise surprise: Joystick drift on the left controller. But not any kind of drift, it pulls hard to the right whenever I push left, so it's IMPOSSIBLE to go left on continuous movement games, and it sometimes pulls right when I am moving forward. This type of stick drift will NOT be diminished by software calibration sadly.I could claim the warranty right now, but apparently I have to ship the ENTIRE Oculus back and Amazon won't pay shipping fees because I have shipped the product outside the US. Meaning that it's probably cheaper (in time and money) to buy an entirely NEW left controller for $69 from the Oculus store and get it shipped than paying shipping fees, being out of an Oculus for god knows how long (According to other users they take somewhere between 2 and 8 WEEKS or longer to get the product back), set it all up once again, and all of that hassle just to most likely, as said by other Oculus owners, get a REFURBISHED controller back.I feel SCAMMED regarding this, but your mileage may vary as I have seen other users with controllers lasting for about 1.5 to 2 years without developing issues, seems like I just got a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, one that apparently I just have to deal with now. The only reason I would give 2 stars is that, even if I got a defective controller, the experience has been amazing, which kind of saddens me and makes me give it 1 star because I really looked forward to using my headset more often, which will now be an awful experience thanks to the stick drift.

Got a humble bundle with a few VR games and this seemed to be a popular headset. So far I'm not overly impressed with the setup but will try it. I have the games in steam and don't want to spend $30 to have virtual desktop. That being said Airlink has been a challenge to set up so far and I feel for anyone who is non technical trying to set this up to work with steam. Will update my review once/if I get it working.I managed to kind of get it working sometimes but you have to uninstall and re-install the PC Quest app in order to get the device to pair with AirLink. Seems like I can't just put the headset on and play, I have to spend an hour removing and re-adding the device, removing and re-adding the software, rebooting systems that are completely fine otherwise. Even the hardwire I tried tonight did not work as expected. Seriously considering returning the unit. The only reason I run out of battery so far is spending an hour removing and putting it back on trying to get it to talk to the PC in any way.

I had the Quest 1 for a year before buying this one. While the display itself is a bit lower quality (read about that online) the extra rendering quality makes the overall experience superior. I see things in Onward that I did not see in the Quest 1.The lighter weight is a plus. The new hand controls have a different feel; I think they are not as comfortable as the Quest 1 controllers. I've gotten used to them now.One downside is that the power cord is only a foot long. If I want to play when the battery is running out I can't do it. So, if you have a Quest 1, save that long cord and when you pass on your Quest 1 to someone else, give them the shorter cord.

I was very very impressed with the Quest 2 out of the box. The setup was surprisingly easy and the VR experience was better than I expected. I was really getting into it when after a month the darn thing died. Searching online I found many owners that had the exact same problem I was experiencing.  There didn't seem to be a consistent solution and many, like me, wound up with an expensive brick,  I contacted Oculus/Meta support two or three times with no response. What to do? Thank God for Amazon customer service.Based on my one month of happy use I may get another Quest 2. I do have $100 or so invested in software.  Then again I could eat the $100 and  just wait for some other company to market a stand alone VR headset.If the thing still worked I would give a four or five star rating. Amazon customer service continues to be a five.Update 4/22 I bit the bullet and bought another Quest 2.  We'll see how long this one lasts.

I’ve always wanted VR tech but was always held back with reports of problems with the tech and cost barrier with having to own an expensive gaming PC. I am happy to say that the Quest 2 is the first mainstream and modern VR that is an all in one standalone.I am very impressed with it. From all the features it has including the high resolution screens, comfort, and speakers. The software was much more advanced than expected. I feel like there is so much potential for this tech. Once people try it out they will want to have it. It has many applications for entertainment and real world. I think Oculus is the only main competitor right now and is doing a great job so far. I am curious to see what Apple will bring, but they will have to work very very hard to surpass this. I think it does benefit from the open software with Android. That is a few years from now but will enjoy the Oculus until something better comes along. In the future, I’d like even high res screens, more apps available (which I think will come soon considering the recent explosion in popularity), and increased comfort and usability. It will definitely get better and am excited for the future and possibilities of it. I’d highly recommend the product. Feels like when I got my first Xbox.

I think for the cost, this is the best option out there. It's not super sharp, and I definitely recommend a third-party head strap attachment for comfort and clarity. I think this would be 5 stars if they included a padded head-strap and a little better resolution. Audio is pretty good. Games are fun, although really not plentiful.

I love the Oculus Quest 2.  It is a great experience... BUT!The first unit I got within a week had a ""cooling issue"". I used the mobile app to attempt to submit a support ticket and it looked like it went through, but there was no confirmation or way to see the status or even verify that it worked!  After 2 days I just did an Amazon return (thank you Amazon) and got a replacement unit.Now though the app still shows that old unit as one of my devices.  So I go through the web site to remove the defective device from my account.  You have to click through a bunch of confirmation windows and even enter a code that they email you to verify it is you (again!) only to end up getting ""An Unknown Error Has Occurred"" message.  (tried that process multiple times on various computers and browsers... you know, because that is the first thing they are going to tell you to do... no luck!So now lets try to open a support ticket about this issue... after going through all the ""self help"" crap to get to the button to open a ticket I end up on a screen that says ""Select Device"" and I kid you not, THERE IS NO PLACE TO SELECT A DEVICE!So bottom line is the device is amazing and tons of fun, but you better hope and pray that you never need support.

I love the device and the concept of the device. You really get immersed into games and you can be lost for hours. I can deal with the badly designed adjustable strap by purchasing better and more comfortable head strap which I shouldn't with the cost. I can deal with the fact that if you have to wear glasses you have to be careful not to scratch the lenses when taking on and off by purchasing prescription lenses. What I cannot deal with is when you are forced to merge your oculus and FB account in order to setup and use the device. I also cannot deal with this merge when there are no human beings to talk to if you run into an issue with your FB account and even though you have a Oculus device, because it's merged with FB, they can't even provide the support you need. I used my Oculus for 2 months and as of April 2022, I've been locked out of my FB account for 4 months and my device is an expensive paperweight all because I can't get human support from FB.

As a middle aged female, I was skeptical about ordering this, my son is a big gamer and I never understood the attraction until the oculus 2. I am hooked. Setup was easy. I just made a simple meta/Facebook account and that’s it you’re on your way. This device allows fun from home, you can play alone or with others online games are reasonably priced and the graphics are top notch. So now I’m a gaming/nurse. I’ll probably upgrade and purchase one as a surprise for my son. Bottom line just get it!!!!!!!!!!

I was really looking forward to using the Oculus.  It set up with no problem and connected to WiFi and I thought they were pretty cool.My issue is that even with the glasses insert in, my glasses scratched the Oculus lenses and this was only after my first time using them, probably 1/2 hour max.  Fortunately, my regular prescription glasses were not scratched.Now, they do have third-party options like buying spacers for the lenses to prevent the lenses from being scratched by glasses and you can pay to have prescription lenses made.  However, I planned on using this with my wife who also wears glasses so prescription lenses aren't that great of an option.However, I was so turned off by this that after consulting with my wife, I decided to return them.My recommendation for anyone who wears glasses is to buy the spacers first to prevent any damage and then if desired, go the prescription route.

We've had an Oculus Quest for going on two years now, so I was super excited to upgrade to the new one and see how much better it was. I have to tell you...the original while heavier and hotter had a way better strap system to keep it on your head. Every time I'd go to use the Quest 2 I'd end up with a headache or my face would hurt. Trying to keep it from slipping off your face means making those fabric straps super tight, which just makes your head hurt. I finally ended up buying an elite strap (not the offical Oculus one, but a nicely padded one that hopefully won't break) just so that I could use my Quest 2 comfortably. The charging cord that's included is also super short as compared to the original Quest, no doubt so that you have to buy a longer one and spend more money. In all, while there were some improvements made from the original, they also changed things for the 2nd that made it so that you have to spend more on accessories just to be able to use it. Very disappointed in Meta.

I am not a hardcore gamer. I like to play something fun from time to time, but I am too lazy and cheap to keep up with gaming tech and I absolutely hate it when I realize that my 3.5 year old laptop is too old to play something I wanna play.On the other hand I like handhelds and I have bought most of the last several big ones that have been released. I am pretty happy with handheld graphics and quality of games.All that is just the lead up to saying I like the Quest 2. Easy to get into, plenty of quality content both free and paid. I like Rec Room for free, Pop One for paid. There's evem esoteric stuff like Altspace with group therapy sessions and open mic nights. A lot to explore id you had the time.Anyway, I am happy with the purchase. Worth the money. Headset fits me well, no pain and not blurry. I dont have the elite strap and dont need it. I am just a normal guy and am happy with this.

It’s impressive how much it can offer for such a low price. Have issues like low resolution screens and even lower resolution offered to us when playing games or workout apps to the point that I was thinking if person in front of me didn’t just came out of Minecraft and trying to teach me how to break blocks with gloves. Sometimes guardian was following me instead of being in one place.. very frustrating. More and more things that are bad like small Field of view or not intuitive adjustment for lenses that are also getting foggy extremely quickly for me. Nevertheless that might be like nothing to many people. I could live with all of that because the thing is incredibly powerful and outstanding for the price with hands training, mixed reality, holograms or just flexibility with the chip already inside that can handle a lot. I just couldn’t find time or space so decided to return. Overall I would feel bad to give it less than 5 stars. Well deserved.

Respecto del envió: Llego en perfecto estado (por lo que se puede apreciar) y listo para funcionar, además de que llegó antes de lo esperado.Respecto del objeto en si, ha sido bastante entretenido tanto para mi como mis padres. Es algo difícil de configurar al comienzo, y creo que a los adultos puede que les cueste más pero no hay mucho problema ya que hay mucho video tanto en español como ingles que explican como configurar algunos aspectos.Recomendaciones y avisos:Si tienes un BUEN PC y Steam (en mi caso) puedes llegar a acceder a más juegos algunos gratis incluso. Si no tienes un PC prepárate para gastar un poco de plata, ya que la tienda del Oculus la considero algo cara para mi bolsillo.Si usas lentes prepárate para sufrir un poco, vas a ver borroso pero seguirá siendo jugable xdRevisa que tu IPD (interpupillary distance) este dentro de los limites del casco que creo que es 68mm, si tu IPD es más de eso NO compres el producto, no podrás jugarlo.

I was provided with access to this Oculus Quest 2 VR by my son. He assumed I wouldn’t like it because it is VR and therefore scary. Couldn’t have been more wrong. It’s a great way to get exercise without boring machines that double as clothes racks or walking a block only to feel excruciating pain in my feet and back.Oculus comes With great programs but you can also purchase even better ones. Some of the programs such as Supernatural give you 30 days trial before billing your credit card.The Oculus is very easy to use (and I am a very stupid computer user). It has all Levels of programs and great tutorials. You can use it for exercise but there are many other other uses as well which include games, travel to amazing places, and TV. I’m even getting ready to try out a painting program.If you are going To use it for exercise but are a little leery of the price, I found it cheaper than the exercise machine/clothes racks.I definitely recommend this VR machine.

Headset failed and wouldn't reboot. Followed directions on Oculus website to correct, including factory reset, and nothing helped. Contacted customer support chat and they had me go through the steps I already went through following their online steps. When that didn't work, they wouldn't move forward without me sending them video showing I followed the steps - I've never heard of anything so absurd. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told the supervisors don't talk or chat with customers. I refused to jump through the video hoop, and the agent ended the chat.At the end of chat I had an option to request an emailed transcript of the chat, which I did - I did not receive one.I don't blame the agent - this is clearly a serious issue with how Oculus views customer support.

The field-of-view on the Oculus Quest 2 is too narrow compared to something like the Valve Index. With the Oculus 89 degrees, you feel like you have a TV on your nose versus the true immersion you get from the valve Index with its 130 degrees. I really think the Oculus does a disservice to the VR community at large because the experience (even with current technology) can be so much better than what this product delivers.I can definitely appreciate Facebook's efforts at making a simple, easy-to-use, all-in-one product that just works out of the box. This probably makes it a good product as a general purpose novelty for use with family or friends over the holidays or something. If you actually care about VR technology and don't mind taking the time to configure a few things, the valve index will offer you a superior experience. It's not even close unfortunately.Returned.

Being able to play anywhere without cords is the future of VR and Oculus 2 does this right.There are a lot of fun games, Eleven Table Tennis, Onward (an FPS Shooter), mini golf, and loads more depending on what you are looking for.You have to experience this new level of gaming trust me.

Oculus was the company that brought us VR. They pushed hard via donations to make it a reality. They ended up bringing one of the biggest gaming minds to the mix John Carmack. Then all of a sudden facebook bought them out and all of their promises turned into lies. Like exclusive games not being a thing. Lie after lie after lie and the end result is the quest with its name changed to Meta. Basically throwing Oculus under a bus. Its hard to be happy, positive or even like this whole transition. It leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth that was involved and sadly seeing Oculus just turn into nothing is heart breaking.Glad others have picked up on the VR market because the Quest is not the way to go. I gave it 3 stars because its affordable but other than that just bad market all over it.

Had this for about 2 months before the left controller just died completely. I sent it to Oculus for RMA. That was over a month ago. They said they'd send a new controller on December 28th, but that never happened. They DO NOT have phone support. Everything is through chat only and they always give you the same response to any inquiries on the ticket. They're ""escalating it to the Logistics team"". I've never experienced customer support this bad before. If you're going to buy this, DO NOT send anything to them for RMA. You'll never get it back. Find another way to get the issue fixed.

I love playing my games on my laptop.  Should say ""loved"".  I like ""escape room"" type games that make you use logic and reasoning to figure out solutions to puzzles, locks, etc.  I had no idea what I was getting into when I first put this thing on.  Just plain WOW.  I'm now IN the game and it's an amazing experience.  I haven't had this much fun in a while.  Would HIGHLY recommend, although I guess you have to love gaming to begin with but if you do......Cons:  You have to have a Facebook account to use.  I've heard they may change that to just being required to have an Oculus account.  Not yet though.  The headset is a little bulky.  I'm going to try a upgraded head strap to see if that helps.  Some games will take a little getting used to as far as motion sickness goes.  If you are into logic with adventure, I can't say enough about The Room and Red Matter.  If I never buy another game again, I would say the experience of playing these two games was worth every penny for the purchase of the Quest 2.

So far I've had fun with this device. It works with SteamVR, and through that engine you can load other things. I was able to get the VR vivecraft mod working so my son could try minecraft VR.The learning curve to VR is steep and it makes my eyes tired. I am a little susceptible to motion sickness but thus far haven't experienced any from the quest 2.

Had for a couple days now and playing  some of the games is so immersive you can easily lose yourself in them. The biggest con of this is the original head straps are no way meant for a long duration and I would even say short duration. I admittedly have a huge head but even my 13 year old brother could only play play for a short time as the original straps w/ oculus feel like they are sucking your eyeballs out. You will have facial pain for sometime after playing.  Everyone's head shape is not the same and I don't think they truly factored that in when developing straps.  Would HIGHLY recommend buying on brand or off brand elite / comfort strap when purchasing this.

I also saw the Foo Fighters, Roots and Snoop Dogg in V-concert free.  This being said, it also emulates reality in that to experience different and more exciting things One has to spend money.  If you bought a playstation you would have to buy games anyway.  Also, you will have to join Facebook. I opened an account just for Oculus.

I would say this is good. There are some fantastic immersive games that just take a completely different spin. Resident evil is amazing on this. I have a psvr and the quality of this is better! Unfortunately there are so many cool things that they could do that they have not. The app library for movies is terrible! Barely anything I use is supported and the things that are, work terribly. Certain apps barely load and when they do, they barely take advantage of the 3D or VR. So essentially it does the job when it comes to games and the browser but everything else could be way better if it was better supported. Many people complain about the Facebook sign in. Who cares? If you don’t have Facebook, don’t get it. If you have Facebook, then don’t complain because I’m pretty sure everyone does not read the terms and conditions anyway, so what difference does it make.

Amazing headset, no complaints about the product whatsoever.My problem is with the $50 Promotion.It only appears in small text below the listing how you are able to acquire the $50 gift. I assumed the gift would be presented after check-out, but nope nothing since I ""didn't enter the Promo Code""... really disappointed that it wasn't more clear how to redeem this Promotion and I kind of think this was intentional so they wouldn't have to shell out the $50 to folks like me who do not always read the tiny fine print at the end of the product. So I got screwed out of the $50 I though came with the unit and honestly influenced me to buy it.Buyer beware, ENTER THE PROMO CODE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!!

As much as I absolutely despise Facebook, I have to admit, you can't beat what you're getting for the price. The next step up from this is around $700-$1000, and is very minimally better. If you want to get into VR, go with Occulus. If you can't bite the bullet for Facebook, just wait for the prices to drop further. Also, the Facebook account thing has inconsistent information floating around. You have to make an Occulus account, not a Facebook account to use it. There is a massive difference that people tend to ignore completely. I made an account and not once did it show up on Facebook, even when searched. OCCULUS ACCOUNTS ARE SEPERATE FROM FACEBOOK!

When Amazon offered this on interest free payments, I jumped on it. My kids entire Christmas was made! They couldn't believe they finally got that expensive toy they have begged for, for a while. So thank you for offering the payments, without that we couldn't have done it. They love it so much I have not gotten to play much but I did get to do the roller coaster simulator briefly. I had to sit down to do it, it was so realistic that when I attempted standing up I was getting dizzy. Not in a bad way, just felt real and thought well I don't ride roller coasters standing up, maybe I should sit down.

This product is amazing for its novelty with 'VR'. For new 1st time users it's as if the Big Bang characters had morphed into your room and were playing episodes of Star Trek. The idea or concept of fully immersive VR doesn't seem to have caught up with the hype. It is more like looking through your old viewfinder from 70 years ago.  And most of the games available are wipe downs of the same killer games that have been around forever but now are seen through your view finder. It's too bad so many of the games are intended for the millennial crowd instead of applications in immersive VR for adults. And I feel like I am playing with my children's leggo sets for the avatars. Be aware this is first of all a toy, and it's not marketed to an audience that can do much thought encounters.

If you're thinking about getting an Oculus Quest 2, get an Oculus Quest 2. I wasn't really aware of it until just late last year and then received one for Christmas. In short, it is awesome. Just the tutorial apps blew me away. Having had it for about a month now, I've found tons of other apps (some free, some paid) that make it well worth the cost. It's also helped me get back to working out on a regular basis as it has a lot of apps that get you moving but don't feel like a workout. Be aware that you may need to spend more money on accessories, though. The battery only lasts a few hours and the stock strap and face cover are just okay. I wear glasses and use the spacer and AMVR lens protectors and that set-up works great, but there is trial and error on getting the headset's fit right.

This is a very interesting headset however it can be very confusing for non-tech people. And the charging system in it is terrible. The charging cable and charging box does not like to charge the headset I’ve had to make adjustments in order for it to charge so I believe the charging Cable  system is bad.The head system is very heavy on your head you may notice that you get sore spots and can only be worn for a small pieroid of time . We did purchase all the extras including straps and everything to make it more comfortable and I still get sore spots.Otherwise the virtual reality games that you have to purchase extra are expensive. But the VR reality of it is good but very cartoony. I think it’s a very interesting system but it needs some quirks fixed

you may have guessed I have a rather wide face based on the headline, but I assure you I'm no Shrek!  the OQ1 fits my head just fine. After trying this for 2 weeks, with headaches and cheekbone aches all the way through, investing more time into this would have been nonsense. so I returned it, went back to Quest 1 and I have to say, I'm not missing the benefits of Quest 2 all that much.I've also tried a few facial interface, but that creates problems with smaller FOV.  the PID adjustment will not stick, wearing prescription lense mount further destroys FOV, super blurry images to the corners. in fact, the blurry images around the corners was a downgrade from Quest1 IMO.the sharper resolution didn't really do a lot for me, nor helped in sense of immersion because of those damn FOV issues, blurry corners and the general pain.I hope they decide to accommodate people with wider faces with their next revision.

I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.Lets get complaints out of the way first:• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.Do yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).I didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.I don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.I've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.An aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.I have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.There's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

Let me say first off, I didn't realize how unfit I really am LOL this is one of the coolest things I've ever done or used in my life. Hands down. It's personally a great way to workout in your own house, and feel the full effect. I've been boxing and I can barely make through 2 rounds on hard without dying haha Climbing #2 is freaking awesome, and very interesting. The graphics are incredible, and trust me when I say that.Make sure you have enough room in your area, and know your surroundings. I already broke my sealing fan because I was trying to jump in the climb game and I hit the fan LOL. Personally, I can only go about 45 minutes to an hour and I have to take a break. It really messes with your vision so definitely be careful with that. Know your limit, and enjoy it. Games are really expensive, and hardly no free games. So budget your money on it. Definitely read reviews before purchasing anything. Other than that, it's amazing and I'm very excited to explore more. You get a ton of free videos and can explore so much! The background theme is extremely amazing! I hope this helps!

The Oculus Quest system is a great VR console for the average person. Its affordable and a new technology.I reccomend it, though I do want to note the requirements of a facebook is dangerous thing and should not be praised, even if you don't mind it. Please get a alternate account for VR if you do, and make privacy and authentification settings airtight. It is very common for personal accounts to get targeted for a plethora of reasons. Attaching a payment method to social, public media is a bad idea. Be careful.However, this review is not about the console itself, but Amazon. After receiving my package, I thought things were odd. For instance the sleeve was ripped and poorly tapped back together. The inside was also ripped. The contents, aside from the main electronics, were all over the place, unsecure. Initial thoughts were shipping was rough. However, there was more. Dust on controllers, the pull-tabs already removed and in box, and I happened to google an unboxing video. This had been unsealed and opened. I bought a new verion, from Amazon as the seller.The second thought was someone wanted to test it, maybe something happened, but it was still brand new. However, if I saw this in a store, I would look for a nicer box out of concern for quality. This is not ""new"" to a collector of gaming tech! This is not new to a happy child on their birthday or holiday.Upon further research to see if I was an unique case, I found a discovery: Amazon receives returned items, and often markets them as brand new. In some cases this can be fine - wrong unopened item - and I believe it's better than some companies practices of discarding the item for profit, but it is lying, untruthful, and plain scamming.I will likely be keeping this, as I'm privileged to afford this and need it for a project, and later it will be a hand-me-down for my mother. It would only be likely recycled again or just thrown out.It works perfectly. Nothing is damaged at all - its truly new! But there have been times not like my experience that other items have been found inside instead of the intended headset. I also believe that with the market how it is currently, with illness and shortages, it was likely sold at a ""used"" price compared to some other places. I even looked for a used one, and couldn't find one (I don't personally care for this exact system). So it's fine for me, and I can save someone else from being scammed by this system.With my newfound knowledge, however, I will not be buying things from Amazon again. I suggest you be careful also!

Quest 2 lost a star because it isn't big enough to fit over my glasses well, even with the larger faceplate Oculus offers, and because setting up Link to a computer takes several minutes and requires navigating the Quest 2's menus and the PC menus, which means your taking the headset on and off a couple of times. Compared to the Oculus Rift S I already owned, which connects to the PC immediately and fits my head well, it is not as friendly towards PC gaming and larger headed people with glasses.It still gets 4 stars because it's an affordable system that can be used without a decent gaming PC.If you are a PC gamer with some money and want to play VR primarily while connected to your PC, I would advice buying a different headset.If you're on a budget, don't have a gaming PC, and/or don't have a large head or wide glasses, Quest 2 is a  good choice and will save you money with the added bonus of being able to travel without being plugged into a PC (at a cost of some computing power), so you can take it on vacation.The ability to be a travelling/standalone system is unique to Quest, so if that's important to you add another star to my review.If you're wanting to play primarily on PC and/or have wide glasses, subtract a star from my review.

I wrote a previous review about my NC75 Pro Headphones- they are awesome.  Recently, my headphones stopped working as I was listening to them; I had only had them for less that six months. I couldn't figure out what happened. I read the instructions to see what it could be, but couldn't find anything. I contacted Srhythm on their website through email and explained the issue.  The company/Staff was great in helping and supporting the issue.  I was told that the problem could have been a defect in the headphones.  I was very pleased and satisfied with Stella's, and Eva's quick response back each time I emailed. All they wanted me to do was send them the order number, and a video of the problem. I did that.  The next email I received was letting me know that I was approved to receive another set of headphones with the attachments included.  Delivery was 5 -7 days- I received them in less time than that.  As I write this review, I have on my new headphones listening to my favorite music.  I recommend buying from Srhythm- they do respond back in a timely manner, and care about their customers.  They responded in a positive manner and resolved the issue.  I'm back to my routine of enjoying and using my NC75 Pro headphones. I am a happy camper.  Sincerely, Ursulla (very happy camper)

It's really a pretty cool experience. Even a lot of the free content through the TV app is cool.Like, you can experience cities from the vantage point of a drone flying over them. Or people paramotoring far from civilization.The games are also pretty immersive. I hadn't played games in quite a while, but I've been playing more on this because it's more engaging overall.The main benefit of the Quest though, is that it's really cheap compared to other VR headsets and has a larger library of games. The Varjo Aero might be better, but the basic headset costs $2K, and then you need additional hardware to make it work.The Meta Quest 2 gives you a pretty good experience for $300... Unless its IPD adjustments don't match the width of your eyes.  But for the most part that hasn't bothered anyone I know too much.Your eyes also seem to adapt some after you've used the headset regularly for a bit. I used to find it a little blurry in one eye but now it almost immediately seems clear when I put it on.

Let me start by saying that this item is amazing! I bought it for my 11 year old,  tried it myself,  and I was amazed.  You do need a Facebook account to use it,  but that's easy to set up and get going.  Games cost roughly 29.99 to buy,  so that's an extra cost, right off the bat,  on top of this product cost.  My son has an average size room,  and it was easy to set a boundary so he didn't smash into a wall while playing.  The only bummer was the rash he got on his face from the headset. We tried the silicone piece that came with the headset,  tried wiping the headset down, the rash got worse until the headset became unusable.  I guess only a small percentage of people are unable to play for that reason,  but I wish someone would have left a review letting me know it was a thing.  Good luck!!

I see so many people writing reviews about glasses. The headset actually comes with an extension clip that allows people with glasses like myself to play, if people would actually read the directions and see what it is, moat probably throw it away, thinking it's just a piece of garbage plastic. With the extention I can even where my snow boarding glasses, that are huge, comfortably.Buying a new headstrap is essential, the device is very front face heavy, and uncomfortable with the in box strap, but there are literally hundreds of after market alternatives, make sure you pick one with a battery for the counter balance.Make sure you buy some sort of protection for it, grips and some sort of rubber/silicone face cover, as well as lens protectors and a storage case, the device itself is extremely sensitive to light, and even a slight scratch on the lenses essentially destroy its use.If you plan on using it alot, some sort of external power supply, the internal battery is good for about 2 hours. You can pick up a 30MaH portable charger for 20 bucks, carry it in you pocket with the 3-4 ft usb-c wire, and it will power the oculus for 24+ hours of play.Now, the oculus store is ok, not great, there are some A-list games, but the store itself is rather limited, watch a tutorial on how to sideload via developer mode and then you will have access to 10s of thousands of apps and small indie developers. Also, using the link and a PC gives you access to the steamVR library of games, way better products than available on the oculus store.If your new to VR, it's one of the few areas where the software is way behind the hardware capabilities. So alot of apps aren't graphically great but have amazing immersion.All in all, this is the best VR headset on the market when you compare hardware specs, compatibility with the oculus store, sidequest, steamVR, ect, and price. The comparable HTC Hive is $1100.

I have been having a ton of fun with this VR set but found myself frustrated when it suddenly wouldn’t charge after about a month of use. Talking to customer service and searching the internet I found out sometimes if you try to charge immediately after a long playing session, the internal battery will not hold a charge because it it overheated. The device never feels hot, so it isn’t possible to know whether or not your battery is overheated. Best tip I can give is always give your device at least 20 minutes to cool before plugging it in to charge. I know, that adds time and is annoying but it’s the only thing I’ve found that really works. This is a consistent problem from what I’ve been reading. I hope Meta/Oculus figures out how to prevent this in future models.

I got the Quest 2 and was exited to get started with it. Went through the setup and made a facebook account to do the setup. Was pretty annoyed that I needed a FB account to use my Quest but whatever. After I got done with the setup the Facebook account instantly got disabled. With that I cant use the Quest besides going into it and looking around. Screw Facebook. If youre going to force me to use it DONT LOCK ME OUT FOR USING IT!!! If you have a facebook account already and use it im sure youll be fine but if you dont have account be aware that you'll probably have the same issueEdit:So after going to support that didn't help at all cause it's a Facebook issue I just reset the thing and made a new account and no issues with that. And I gotta say not having to deal with wires sbd being able to play anywhere is very nice. I have a HTC vive with wireless but this is a way better wireless experience. It's just a shame the Facebook requirement really effected my initial opinion on it and makes gard to recommend to anyone who don't already use facebook.

I bought this as a replacement for my Oculus Rift, primarily for the increase in resolution but also a little bit for the wireless-ness nature of it (fully intending to use the Air Link option). I really only play three games with VR:  Beat Saber & Thrill of the Fight when I want to work out, and DCS when I want to nerd out.The good:  the device certainly has a better resolution and overall better picture quality than my rift did. With the rift I could pick out individual pixels almost anywhere I looked and that is significantly improved with the Quest 2 and I really have to look hard to start noticing the individual pixels. In DCS I can now clearly read almost all the dials in the cockpit whereas before I really had to look closely at each one. The headset is also slightly lighter which is nice and you no longer need separate tracking cameras which has reduced clutter on my desk (and the number of connections required to my computer - from 4 down to 1).The not so good: If I want to play Thrill of the Fight or Beat Saber (both games I have already bought via the Oculus store): I have to buy them again; OR use the Air Link mode. Unfortunately, the Air Link mode breaks Thrill of the Fight (apparently the room-scale Guardian information does not get transferred to the game correctly via Air Link - an Oculus bug) and Beat Saber ends up being extremely choppy and not enjoyable at all (this is on a 5Ghz Air Link wifi connection and about 4ft from the wireless router). I have read that it's better if you're using wired mode (which also fixes the Guardian bug) so I will try that (why in 2022 can we not make over-air connections as reliable as wired ones?).The plainly terrible: The headband/strap is atrocious, I don't know who designed this or who let this through quality control. It doesn't fit, the top band is almost always just flapping around and the headset ends up resting on the bridge of my nose. There's no headphones on the headset (more like some tiny speakers in the headband that give you a very faded audio experience... like you're listening to something from across a room).  The default padding is inadequate (especially since it's absorbing the weight of the device as it bears down on your face). While I also don't mind the redesign of the controllers I have to ask... why? Did changing the position of the loop really make things better? Cos right now it's just causing me endless problems as 2 years of muscle memory using the old controllers need to be retrained.Conclusion: it does improve my DCS gameplay experience which is the primary reason I bought this; so I am ""happy"" on that account. However the loss of the little things, from the in-built headphones on the headset, the general poor quality of the head strap, to not having to rebuy my games in the same store and the same account have really put a downer on things. I expect better for something nearly $400. I hope that re-wiring it with a cable will improve at least some of the issues and while being wired isn't ideal; it's also not the end of the world for me (especially if it fixes the problems I have).

VR is going to be a very very fun experience with visuals that will WOW a person.  Right now, those types of ""WOWs"" are limited to VR sets that are $1000.. this reasonable $300 VR set allows a person to have a nibble of what's possible and what might be coming to the future with  a very low visual quality.When watching youtube VR.. the videos are very very low quality.The limited eye adjustments of only 3 will have a lot of people looking at blurred VR.There are requirements that people need to follow in order to use this hardware.. requirements that are unreasonable, but reasonable enough for most people.

While I do believe VR is the future in gaming I don’t think Occulus is it. Although  comparatively low priced it falls short for many reasons: It’s always blurry, creates eye strain , too heavy, uncomfortable head strap, too few games, doesn’t really facilitate glasses, randomly glitches etc etcIf not for the pandemic we would have seen Xbox & Nintendo VR by now and while PS VR is technically available getting one at a fair price is difficult at best. Consoles are bought for the games that are available for them and the Occulus library is too sparse.Clearly consumers want VR and will tolerate even crappy VR like Occulus while waiting for The Real Deal. However it will ultimately end up in the graveyard 🪦 for poor tech-as it should.

The oculus is a visually stunning experience the minute you put it on you are taken into different worlds and will definitely forget where you are. The games range in price from $10-$60 there are family friendly games and advanced adult games that are actually scary!

If you use the quest for exercise, expect it to be blurry 1/2 the time. I use the quest mostly to play beat saber and these problems are not solvable mostly due to triggering system problems when trying to work around blurry issues. Two major sources of blurriness: fogging and headset moving down on the face due to its weight and sweat making the silicone pad slippery.To reduce fogging, hang out in the same room with headset for 15 min but don’t do any exercise during that time. Your face and the headset need to be close to the same temp. This will reduce fogging but won’t eliminate it because exercise causes you body temp to rise.To keep the headset from blurring, you can try tightening the straps but, that will eventually trigger a system issue where the headset will temporarily go black and/or pause the game. Adjusting the headset while in game can trigger the same issue.Removing the headset and wiping away sweat can cause multiple problems such as fogging, loss of guardian, going blank or triggering of other system issues. If it works, it will quickly slip down again going blurry.I have tried the standard and elite strap. My next experiment is to try a counter balanced strap.Note: I have not mentioned the multiple system issues that combined with the blurry problem will eventually cause me to give up and let the quest collect dust.

Right out of the box, the Oculus Quest 2 is easy to set up. The controls take a little getting used to but the interface is very user-friendly. I was downloading apps in no time. Expect to spend between $10 to $40 per app. The games tend to be more expensive. Although I'm a gamer and originally bought the VR headset for gaming, I spent the first few weeks exploring the world, creating art in Tiltbrush, and marveling at watching my favorite shows in a virtual theater. The headset is comfortable to wear (it has an extension for people who wear glasses) but after a couple of hours I start feeling it for sure. Which is fine because that's about how long a charge lasts. I love this headset and I'd recommend it for anyone wanting to explore VR at an affordable cost.

The headset was uncomfortable and very difficult to get on or off. I wear strong glasses, which apparently don't go well with the set. The image was very blurry except in the very center; if I shifted my eyes to anything around the edges, it was impossible to make anything out. The straps holding this think on your head are ridiculous. They were tight, uncomfortable, even painful at times. At the price this thing goes for, one should not have to pay more just to make it possible wear it. Sound was good, and the technology is solid, but the construction was not very good. After I took it off (after maybe ten minutes of wearing it) I felt dizzy and nauseated. Finally, there's that old bugaboo: you have to have a Facebook account and basically sign away your privacy to use this thing. Overpriced and poorly thought out. I am very, very disappointed, and am sending it back later today. IF they can come up with a way to make it wear comfortably without having to shell out more money, and IF they can come up with a way to make it viewable for someone who is highly nearsighted, and IF they don't want me in the Facebook system, then maybe I'll give this another chance someday. But for now, I want nothing to do with it.

This is the best video game system I've ever had! The visuals are breathtaking and the games are so immersive and enjoyable. I've actually purchased two of these 😄.Google Chrome cast is a must. It's very annoying when you can't see whats going on in the headset. You can cast it to your phone in the oculus app, but of course, that's a very tiny screen.3 best games to start with:1. Beat Saber - a rhymn game where you slash blocks to the beat2. Moss - an action/puzzle game with a very captivating storyline.3. Super Hot - a game where you fight red glass people. A little tense, but so fun!You can find all of these games in the oculus store

I am not a big gamer, but I am truly enjoying the fitness app Supernatural.  It has got me moving (and liking it) for the first time in a long time.  The Oculus is amazing, and I'm sure I have only scratched the surface of all it can do.  I only took off a star because I have had to buy several accessories in order to use the headset comfortably while exercising.  I have purchased a headband, face masks, anti-fog spray and a fan attachment.  The fan attachment works great at keeps lenses clear.  Also, the subscription to Supernatural was an additional purchase.  I think it's worth it to make exercise fun. Overall, I really love the Oculus, but be prepared to spend extra $$ on apps and accessories.

The first one they sent me was acting up right out of the box. It kept losing tracking and couldn't recognize guardians. I went through every possible troubleshooting step by myself and with meta customer care and they wanted me to send it in and said that would take a couple months. So I just had it replaced through Amazon and they sent a replacement in one day. The one I have now hasn't lost tracking once and works great. If you have problems with yours I would just return it through amazon and skip the whole manufacturer customer care thing because that wasted hours of my life and was very frustrating. Overall this thing is pretty cool 😎

I love, love, love…….. this! I workout every morning and every night! I can see a change in my body and my mind. I love doing the meditation it helps clear my mind keep me focus and helps me with sleep. If you a person that just loves working out at the gym but because of the pandemic you kind of concern of going back this is the best next thing to get to work out at home. If you love dancing this is the next best thing to get or just love having fun on video games and stuff this is the next best thing! I think I only have one downfall on the system is that trying to fix the time on it. The best thing to do if your time is wrong on your oculus is still look it up on YouTube. It took me a couple of days to figure it out but I found out how to do it. Overall I love it me, my daughter, my sister, and soon my nephew loves it!

I have never experienced VR before. Setting up was easy once I knew what to do. The sound quality is surprisingly good, the headset is comfortable, I wear glasses and it's a little snug even with the glasses spacer but my glasses are slightly bigger than the recommended size. I usually only play VR for an hour or two so the battery life lasts long enough for this factor.This headset is my new favorite hobby, game system, activity, etc.For the price, and the fact it requires nothing to set up, this experience cannot be compared to. VR is a beautiful technology, and I have never been happier with this purchase.

First off, Amazon says I have to prove I didn't receive the $50 gift card - looks like I'm not the only one that didn't receive one. The quest is great when it works. I've had to factory reset once already to solve a black screen issue. I would put it on my head, adjust it at any time and it would go black and beep, need to shake my head around to get screen back or reboot. Frustrating when you're in the middle of a game! Also, it goes to sleep when watching a movie or guided meditation and it constantly wants me to setup the guardian area again. A factory reset helped the black screen issue for about a day. I'm RMAing this one because I don't think something should have to be reset within the first week of use and don't think I should have to prove to Amazon that I didn't receive the gift card when they can see others are having the same issue. Very frustrated with Amazon. I'll buy another one, but not from Amazon.

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He used it for boxing workouts. After a month or so, the Oculus got stuck in a boot loop and wouldn’t turn on … just kept trying to boot up without success. He went through Meta support. He was told to box up the device and mail it. He kept checking in, but weeks later the replacement hadn’t arrived. It finally did, rebranded as Meta Quest 2. It worked for a few days, then it got the black screen of death. Support has taken days to get back to him, then they finally replied and told him to do a factory reset. He’d tried that before he contacted them. So far, he probably has been without a working device longer than he’s had a working device. And he’s been extremely frustrated in his dealings with customer service. This whole experience has been unacceptable. It was a splurge gift that he should be able to enjoy. Instead, he’s spent a good portion of the warranty period without a working device.

You've bought this. You're excited by it. Can't wait to get into playing, and exploring. You've bought a bunch of accessories. Official accessories. But, then you use it.The biggest flaw in the engineering of this unit is, ventilation. There is no fix for it, via Oculus. There are a few third party companies that offer face plates that might help and 1...and I mean ""1"" small mountable fan unit that sucks hot air out to help with the lenses fogging up and you sweating like you're in a sauna.C'mon Oculus...which is now no more, or atleast absorbed by FB/Meta. You couldn't have constructed your own accessorie(s) to eliminate the issue??So, if you are considering it. Just know that you may get away with using it for an hour without starting to sweat. And, forget boxing or using the workout/fitness apps.All in all the experience, though dampened by the ventilation issue, is fun. The ability to not be tethered to a wire nor a lit of Oculus store apps, is my fav plus. Hook it up to your capable pc, and play other pc vr compatible games.

I just turned it on and followed the instructions.If I had one suggestion for the manufacturer, it would be to make it a bit lighter.

Wish i would've known before but that's my own fault for not looking into it. Hopefully they'll fix that soon, other than that it works great. Just wish i could play my steam games more efficiently. They should port steam to the oculus so people dont have to pay for games they already own, ive managed to use the experimental airplay and it works but has cut out from time to time. But the fact that you can play vr games with no cords is pretty cool and makes it very portable obviously. Just be aware of the windows 11 compatibility issue.

First: delivery to Russia took 3 weeks. Item arrived well packaged, customs taxes were around $15.The headset itself is a mixed bag.From one side, in *some* apps the immersion is amazing. But those apps and videos are extremely rare. You can only find really immersive videos in the Oculus TV app. They look like 8K 3D, and they are very impressive.There's a lot of 360 degree videos on Youtube, but Quest 2 can only play them in 4K. And in this resolution they look like if you run lowest quality 360p heavily compressed Youtube video on your 50"" TV. I mean it's ugly.Those (seemingly) 8K 3D videos from Oculus TV mostly require to be downloaded before playback. And their resolution looks like 720p on 50"" TV. Definitely not amazing in terms of resolution, but still very immersive. I can only wander how immersive will be 12K and 24K 3D videos in the distant future.The main problem is... I already watched most of these videos in a week. There's nothing left. All other videos even in Oculus TV are between bad and ugly in quality.On the ""home screen"" (or home ambience) everything looks like...well... if you had a myopia.The headset often ""forgets"" the safe play area, and shows positioning errors. A couple of days ago I had to reboot it twice to get rid of this error.All in all, it feels like both technology and content are still in the early development stage. Maybe in 5-10 years it will really become a mature product, but now it's more of a concept or demo.I didn't try Quest 2 linked to PC because I don't have a compatible PC.And the games... well, those I tried to play look like back to 90's. Visual quality is from bad to mediocre, gameplay is extremely simple and limited, but pricing is like AA titles on PC.Notice: I use Quest 2 as a standalone headset. This is my first VR headset, I have nothing to compare.

This is a great product. Amazing capabilities. HOWEVER, it should come with a serious disclaimer regarding people who suffer with motion sickness. I tried. I really tried. Used motion sickness medicine, tried only sitting down while using it, chewed ginger candy, limited my time every use. After more than a week, I was getting sicker and sicker using it, Also felt very claustrophobic with the goggles on. Regretfully, I gave up and ended up returning the device.

This VR is absolutely amazing!! When you put it on, you can’t see Anything else, your so completely immersed! Although, when you want to walk around, it shows you every detail around you!! It is so worth every penny! If your looking for a VR headset, this is it! You do have to have internet connection to update & download your games. However, after downloading the games, your speeds do not effect the game! I have satellite internet, & while it takes a While to download games, once downloaded, it plays just as smooth & seamless as if I had high speed! Now, I don’t know about playing any games with other people online too, we haven’t tried that yet.

I really enjoyed it at first, being a newbie to VR, and it ran as intended. After about a week I needed a new faceplate, some screen covers and a battery back-up. The AirLink works okay, but not consistently enough so I had to buy a long UsbC cord. Then the left controller stopped working completely, and I had to shell out 75$ to replace. The right controller this past week started stuttering and I have to jam a piece of foil between the battery for it to not disconnect in the middle of play. I also find that the headset does not fully shut down and drains battery throughout the night, so it basically always needs to be plugged in if I want to pick up and play whenever.When it works, it's super fun. I can play for hours with a back-up battery. The games are a bit pricey on the Oculus Platform, so you'll mostly be playing SideQuest games and Beat saber for now.

Congratulations, you saved yourself a few hundred dollars! Now, just sign away any ownership you thought you would have over the device because Facebook now owns you.You 100% need an accurate Facebook account tied to your name and phone number, so enjoy the new robocalls and spam texts that accompany this. And best part is: you have no control over the device. Any mods, or other custom content, goes against Facebook's rules, so have fun with their rules forcefully incriminating yourself into make a false developer account to unofficially avoid these. And when they block your 'facebook' account, your Oculus account (which should be separate) will go with it.There's a reason this is cheaper than the competition, and it's not just the resolution, strap quality, or other issues you will immediately face out of the box.

Bought two of these, spoiled I know but wanted to be able to play against/with one another with family and friends. Easy setup just need Facebook accounts which for some may not be right.First one worked fine for awhile then the headstrap broke so need to replace it and the oculus branded one is not cheap. Then the left toggle starts to drift. We think the sensor gets dirty so some alcohol is supposed to work but if not may have to replace.The second oculus we ordered was good for about a day then the left toggle didn't work at all and no matter of reset or cleaning worked. Thankfully we just got it so it was an easy full replacement of the Oculus for a new one which was an easy and fast process.Other than that, time will tell but I think the more use, the more wear so I'd imagine more replacement parts but they are fun for what they are.

The only problem keeping this thing from reaching perfection is the absolute necessity of having a Facebook account in order to use it. Especially with Facebook's recent trend of completely deleting accounts with little to no actual investigation when a person gets hacked, or an image gets taken out of context.  You lose everything. Your entire game collection everything you paid for, gone in a flash.  And then you're just stuck with a brick with straps.Buyer beware of that one, but otherwise, fun for social games, portable is heck, excellent for wireless PC gaming use, metaverse is pointless garbage.

I jumped on the Oculus train after trying one out. I am very careful with all electronics as I know they can be sensitive. My oculus came in original packaging and had the protective film over the lenses. I charged it, put the better head strap on and the face shields. The last thing I did was remove the film. It appeared the lenses were dirty from the factory. I have transition glasses so I used my microfiber glasses cloth to clean them. The were about 3 noticable spots on the right lens that won't come off and are right in my field of view.  For $400 I cannot accept this, & tried multiple times to clean the lenses. Also things in VR seem very grainy into they get right up super close like an old man trying to read small print. If I do this, the objects are crystal clear, but only when super close. What's this about?Also, 2 hour charge time for maybe an hour of play time..... Not a great ratio.Not completely impressed.

Es decir, están pensadas para jugar de forma autónoma, sin necesidad de cables porque tienen su propia batería!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Los juegos son muy divertidos, he probado el Beat Saber (el juego TOP del que todos hablan) y es fabuloso, pero también testeé el super hot, y es increíblemente inmersivo, muy pero muy divertido!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Los controles con precisos, perfectos casi, el reconocimiento de movimiento es milimétrico, y todo responde de maravilla.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️El sistema Guardián es impresionante, puedes delimitar tu área de juego, incluso puedes ""escanear"" tu sofá para jugar cómodamente en él.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️El sonido es muy bueno, realmente suena bien, me gustaría probarlo con audífonos.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️La batería dura lo suficiente, se echa en falta carga rápida (sobre todo porque utiliza conector usb-c).⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️La pantalla es muy buena, incluso funciona a 120hz!💥Puntos no tan fuertes💥Las correas no son muy cómodas, toma su tiempo ajustarlas. Es casi una compra obligada una correa de mayor calidad.El punto justo de visión es variable dependiendo de cada persona, pero su ajuste es bastante complicado, toma su tiempo y varios intentos.Se echa en falta una funda de serie para protegerlos (no les puede dar la luz del sol, o se quema la pantalla, atención con este detalle!).Los controles deberían tener una referencia física de R y L (derecha e izquierda) es fácil confundirlos.Deberían incluir algunos juegos precargados, o bien algunos juegos de regalo al comprar el equipo, para poder utilizarlo y testearlo a full, antes de pasar por caja.⚠️Exige utilizar una cuenta de Facebook, la privacidad se ve completamente comprometida, además, si la cuenta es dada de baja por la empresa, se pierden todas las compras y dólares invertidos en la misma, mucho cuidado con eso! ⚠️----------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusión.Es un producto superior, a un precio muy bajo en relación a lo que ofrece.Indispensable para todo gamer, es mucho más divertido que las consolas de sobremesa, y el efecto WOW es totalmente real, es otro mundo, y la experiencia es alucinante.Le pongo un 9, es un producto casi perfecto.Súper recomendado!

Even with new batteries, both controllers will short out. Guardian will show error as if it's not detected when not moving from the area. Controllers will glitch in game play as in they won't detect movement at certain times. If I take out the new battery for the right one and put it back in, it works fine for only about 10 minutes then says check battery & disconnects again. Charge on headset lasts about 30 minutes if that. Noticed when first purchased battery lasted on headset for 45 to 50 minutes. Manufacturer makes it difficult to request warranty help.

I understand that there may be different degrees of motion sickness. Some may be able drive, & the second you look at the passenger seat your stomach just says nope. For some people, oculus has been able to help. With the intensity light idea they put in this v.r. computer. However, they are not able to help everyone. After over a week of trying, just going into a chat room setting down or standing, 7ish minutes and, well I'll save you the details but, after time in the restroom it was naptime and a trip to ups. It's a great item if your stomach can take it.

So this is my first time ever venturing off into the VR world, and I tell you this product for me is a winner.  I like that it's wireless, second I like that it was pretty easy to figure out, and lastly it was easy to adjust my head and eyes.  Set up was easy on this and I'm a true beginner with this product, and it's amazing the things you can do in the VR world.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.

Excellent VR, I have tried most of the VR's in the market and I can say the Oculus Quest 2 is the very best out there. Excellent immersion, a very complete and robust marketplace. Being Android can't go wrong. It's excellent for gaming the VR quality games, it's quite good for reading, great for watching videos. Comfortable navigating with the super responsive controllers and quite easy to type on the virtual keyword.The headset is quite comfortable and adjustable to your eyesight. If you wear glasses it has an additional extension you can put but I felt it was putting too much stress on my glasses and they might break so I don't wear them with the Oculus. But unless you have considerable sight loss you probably won't need to wear them with the Oculus.*Downsides:* as good as it is the technology of VR is still extremely limited and it's pretty much just watching a big screen around you like if you were in a planetarium. You will not feel the level of realism or immersion of Cyberpunk genre Science Fiction. We are decades or maybe even a century away from that.The headset is comfortable but if you wear it for over an hour it starts getting very uncomfortable and some people might get headaches.It's still mostly a gimmick to have fun. For work, meetings, or ""adult"" practical use is mostly useless.Some people will have issue that you are forced to use your Facebook account.Different profiles / accounts is kind of tedious. It's probably best for single person use.If you are in stationary mode it's good for watching videos or reading. But to fully experience it or game with it you need lots of space, 6.5 sqft so be conscious of that before buying.

I am a 54 year old married man and we are having a blast. Just purchased before Christmas and have no regrets so far. I think it's definitely worth the price. Battery only last 2 hours so getting a VR battery pack is nice. They fit easily on this headset and you don't even know you're wearing it. The VR system is user friendly and easy to navigate. I don't normally ever have motion sickness and love roller coasters - flipping around and all that. On the VR, I can't do it. I get motion sickness sitting down and lose my balance standing up.However, all the other games and fitness apps are great. Love boxing and first steps is fun. VR is the wave of the future.

Privacy concerns aside this is a great platform and clearly is the future of gaming. Not so sure about the whole metaverse thing. I prefer the real verse truth be told. The big issue is it being linked to facebook. I had been off of facebook for years but had to re-enable my account just to set this thing up. Hopefully the promised non-facebook accounts will be forthcoming from ""Meta"". Otherwise for $300 this thing is insane. The Star Wars games are amazing! Its like you're in the movie! Its just a lot of fun and a lot more physical than your run of the mill console. Highly recommended!

Tech support from amazon and Facebook is completely useless. Had this for three months and it developed a freezing issue every few seconds. Amazon passed me off to meta (Facebook) and meta keeps trying to make me do troubleshooting methods that don’t work and now they want video proof that is impossible to provide. I’ve been disconnected three times from chat and each time they want to review chat logs and then they disconnect. Save your time and money. It’s not that great of an experience even when it does work. Way overhyped.

From the games, VR videos, this device is really amazing.I got the one with the larger memory and I'm glad I did as I suspect that we will use this a lot and add more and more games and videos.  I find that some fast moving games can start to give me motion sickness after playing on it too long, but that's not necessarily a bad think, otherwise I'd be on it all day.Great fun product for all the family.

First,I didn't want to get it after hearing other reviews. My 13 yr old son really wanted it, so it was a gift. Very cool, but I told him you'll start doing crap like it's reality. So after 20 minutes he's nauseous bad! Literally at the toilet. Then he was playing a game where he's an ape and has to move himself with his arms to walk... So what happens when he stops playing? He starts walking down the hallway moving his arms like the ape. Lol whatever.. he doesn't want to return it but definitely can not play long. He still thinks it's cool.

Im honestly shocked at how great the Quest 2 is and bummed I waited so long. I was a relatively early adopter of the PSVR but this destroys that device in ergonomics. It’s also wireless so you can turn around full 360° without worrying about wires, which gives a lot more immersion. Tons of content. Bummed I’ll never be able to play Half-life Alyx because I’m not a PC guy, but for the price, this VR headset can’t be beat!

I bought this for one particular game but discovered many more uses for this such as watching TV and movies and fitness programs as well. I'm so Happy I decided to buy this. Comes with headset, charger cord and plug and one left handle and the right handle. Was playing within mins and find myself loosing track of time. I highly recommend this device!

I bought 2 of these units and both had the same issue. The left lens had a major blurred spot on it right in the line of vision. I tried all 3 settings, cleaned the lens (yes I removed the protective plastic film) and even had someone else that has an Oculus try it and said they saw the same blurred spot on both headsets. The other issue, not as many good games to play unless you're into fighting and shooting games. I was looking for flight simulations games and something other than fighting and shooting. Found Richie's Plank to be fun but hard to play with a blurred left lens.

I am not thrilled about the quality,  its very hard to adjust to your eyes and does not have ability to change the focus to make it sharp.  You not notice it when you look at entire screen,  but if you want to watch movie or open browser it will be not perfectly clear,  and you will have not fun using it :(  I think the idea is good but the technology needs better quality parts !

I've been looking forward to virtual reality for a long time but the games just don't do it for me. I don't even care about Facebook or how comfortable it is, I just wish there were better games.In a nutshell it feels like 95% of the games are pumped out with the exact same style artwork, mediocre music and sound effects, and not a lot of depth. After only playing a few titles you start to grow sick of it. There are only a few ""real"" games available on this system. If there were even a system that recreated your favorite old school 8-bit games in sudo-VR it would blow this system out of the water. They really missed the mark on what makes a game good.

I am not a fan of facebook, I started with PSVR, then went to the vive cosmos elite, then to the valve index. The big thing that those other headsets are lacking is good wireless support, which the quest has.  I didn't want to like it, but the feeling of having no wires, controllers that aren't bad (once you get the knuckle straps) and decent resolution.. It's really good especially when you consider the price it starts at.  The main thing that I wish it did better in is FOV, it's not bad, but it isn't as good and the index, which is fair when again, you consider how much it costs and what you get.

What are you doing? Yea I’m talking to you the person behind this screen. Why are you looking at reviews when this has pretty much 5 stars (4.8). Only thing people say negative about it is because FB login. Who the hell cares. If you can’t beat them join them. When I’m dead they can have all my info I won’t need it. Now the oculus is definitely the best bang for your buck. Battery last about a good 2 hours but you can charge and play it at the same time. I would recommend getting a guard for your remotes. There plastic and like to bang around a lot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Best experience in my opinion and yes I have glasses and they fit comfortably. But other people are different obviously. If you have the money I would definitely buy one. I’m going to be buying another here shortly. 5/5

This virtual reality headset makes me feel like I am living in the future. I don't hate the console style monetization as that encourages development of new games, despite the high price tag. At least for now there is no subscription service and that will suffice for now. Besides there are many great free games as well, such as Echo VR and Pavlov Shack Beta.The stock headset comes with an ok strap and lackluster battery life both of which can be remedied with more money for an improved strap, some of which come with batteries.Virtual Reality sickness is very real and you will most likely experience it in your first couple games where your body movement does not line up with your character movement, such as in Echo VR. This problem doesn't exist in Beat Saber or Super Hot and you can exclusively play stationary games if you so choose.Overall, the Oculus (Meta) Quest 2 brings virtual reality to the masses with a plethora of super cool features, hand tracking and passthrough are both pretty good. However, the relatively low price point gives it some drawbacks that are acceptable at this stage of the game.

I was told by a friend to go with the $299 setup. it was the best way to go for the price. its also a very nice option if you have never used a VR headset. I mean some people can never get used to them and others its no issue at all. you can buy the more expensive setups but the elite strap eventually breaks. i was told ""IF"" you enjoy playing in VR and have no issues you can upgrade to a more expensive setup. im glad i went this path. I can research for a more expensive setup later. not in a rush since this Quest 2 has been an excellent starting point. We've been having a blast in our house with 2 of them. at least 1 is being used daily. 1 is stand alone and the other is connected with a pc. both run great with no issues.

Okay so if you encounter this review you may be surprised why I have not blindly given this product a solid 5 stars.First things first, the pros. It is an overall good and functional HMD. Unlike the compeition, it supports both standalone software for those that do not have a VR ready gaming PC. PCVR connectivity is pretty much plug and play if you do decide to go through that style of gameplay. It also has a wireless option if your home network can support it.Another thing is that setup is extremely easy. Inside out tracking is pretty decent and does not require basestations or lighthouses for tracking unlike the competition. The resolution is higher in comparison to the previous iterations of Oculus HMDs. This HMD is a good entry level VR headset.Now for the cons. Off the bat, the stock strap is not really good. I can see children and adults with below average head sizes being fine with the headstrap but, for an average or larger adult head size, you won't be able to play for more than 30 minutes without the headset putting strain towards your cheekbones. Other cases have reported irritation to the ears. The only solution to this would be to invest in their ""elite strap"" which in my opinion, should have been the stock strap. To be honest, a 3rd party halo strap would be a better investment than their OEM elite strap.Now for the facial interface. It is sandpaper to the face. If you ordered this HMD prior to having an included silicone cover, expect to get face marks and rashes. Although the new silicone cover has prevented further problems, it is still not comfortable as the cushioning is still too firm on the interface itself. Expect to spend more for a 3rd party facial interface.Now for gameplay and experience. Remember how earlier I mentioned the increased resolution from previous Oculus models, it does not matter now. If you are someone who is planning to solely use this HMD for PCVR/SteamVR, you're gonna have a hard time wondering how this is an upgrade from other HMDs on the market. The amount of compression and artifacts I have noticed playing is just beyond acceptable. I do not understand why Facebook (or Meta whatever) decided to solely use USB C to encode both audio and video through the headset. They could've at least made use of adding a display port (or even an HDMI port for all I care). The increase in resolution is useless at this point. Even if you change and max out settings through their desktop app, debug tool and 3rd party Oculus tray tool, those same artifacts and compression in image quality is noticable. The HTC Vive has a better PCVR experience than this considering that it is older. I can understand that the main purpose of this headset was to be a consumer friendly standalone headset but for those of us that bought this thinking it would be a step up for PCVR gameplay, I am sorry to say this but we were scammed. I am hoping that the developers do realize that is a problem and consider investing a good portion of their time finding a credible solution. If you think about it, the hardware power is there with the Quest 2, but the software implementation and execution is extremely buggy.Finally defects. Unfortunately, when my Quest 2 arrived, it came with a defective right touch controller. The issue was that the thumb capacitor was not sensing thumb movement. This is gamebreaking if you play games with hand gestures. Moreover, my unit came with dead pixels when bringing up passthrough mode. Although not game breaking, it was still annoying. After looking through some online forums, these seemed to be consistent problems with other people. Luckily Amazon offered to exchange my unit for a completely brand new one free of charge.Overall it is a functional HMD and a steal for the price but it still has a long way to becoming the greatest HMD on the market. More importantly, PCVR experience. I would advise the developers to look further to improving PCVR as a significant amount of people bought this for that sole purpose. With rumours of a Valve Index 2 in the works with supposed standalone support included, Oculus needs to find a way to keep up.Update: I just received replacement Amazon sent me to replace my defective unit turns out to be much worse. There is rattling components inside and I was advised by support to replace it again due to risk of short circuiting! I am actually worried that something might blow up while I am playing. I have downgraded my rating from 2 stars to 1. If the 3rd replacement is still defective, I am refunding ASAP. I don't know if it is just me but the quality control has been poor so far.

Go to oculus webiste and go to support, make sure to open a chat window, dont call them or do an email, because quite frankly, you're as impatient as me. The chat window option is hard to find for support but if the gods bless you then you will stumble upon its beauty. Right off the bat (being impatient) open the ticket with what you want done, unlinking. The way I finally got support to do it for me was not making it an option, I made it clear I was not requesting to unlink, I NEEDED to unlink, it was a NEED. Not a request. You paid 299 for this bad boi and you deserve some authoritay. I also made it clear that oculus was my issue (bamboozled them) saying I wanted to unlink my oculus from my facebook, not vice versa, and not is that it was possible. That it was happening.

Not the hugest selection of games, but there are absolutely games that make buying this headset worth it!!  Some games you need to have connection to a computer which you can do by getting the vr desktop app or by connecting directly to your computer with a cable.  I recommend cooking simulator vr, blade and sorcery, zero caliber, and foreVR bowl :) great games could play these all day!!

The oculus itself is a decent piece of tech, though the eye resolutions are a bit rough and streaming VR videos is a bit buggy. The major issue is with Oculus Link, attempting to use this feature causes immense and disorienting stuttering and freezes in the headset. I scoured the support page, reddit threads, and other forums and there seems to be no solid solution for this issue. I tried a dozen 'fixes', including starting my pc offline and wiping oculus' data and redownloading it after a restart. Until oculus link functions, I cannot recommend this device.

Haven't played video games for years. Got this to keep myself occupied while working out of town this winter. Mainly just play two games normally. Contractors which is the best online shooter game I have ever seen. Thrill of the fight is a boxing game that give you quite a workout in only about 20 minutes. I did deduct a star because the headband that comes with it sucks and battery dies in about an hour and a half. I had to purchase a halo style headband and a power bank with short cord to make this better.

Been using it for a month now, I’m a VR Fanatic, I got the PSVR and is nothing compared to the Oculus Quest 2, the features are amazing, the way you can text your Facebook and instagram friends was good, the store has daily deals, built-in microphone and headphones, is just crazy, I thought I needed my phone connected to the oculus all the time but no, this is a whole new console! Connect it to wifi and you good to go! Watch YouTube, Netflix, web browser or TV.The phone app is just to Cast gameplay and download clips/screenshots you take during game in my opinion because the rest you can do it on the oculus.•The only problem I been having is the weight, after a few minutes my neck starting to hurt because the headset is too heavy for me other than that I have no complains.

I am pretty late to the party about the Quest 2. I only started to become interested in VR ever since my sis got the Valve Index. But I couldn't get one because of the skin irritation people got from wearing the headset. But ever since they announced they will bring it back twice the storage for the same price, it was a no-brainer decision. Then I heard rumors about a new Quest headset getting announced at the end of October. Oh well, I love using the Quest 2 so far. But, if you have an intention to get a Quest headset right now, I suggest you wait until what Facebook has to say.

Good product for non-glass wearer.Very unfriendly to glass wearer: it claims to be fitting for 142mm wide frame, mine is around 135mm, barely fit it.Squeeze my glasses so hard and feels extremely uncomfortable.I compared the width with my galaxy VR (bought a few years ago), the galaxy VR is almost one inch wider than the quest, no wonder it feels so uncomfortable.If you are a glass wearer, please be prepared to buy prescription lens for this.

With upgrades and computer you can stand up there with the best setups. If you are interested in joining a virtual world like VRChat but havent yet. Just buy one of these. If you have computer with a rtx 2070 or better... Definitely buy one of these. With some accessory upgrades this can be a great setup.  You can start from just one of these and work up to whole setup. Its a perfect entry point.  Buy the virtual desktop app and you have a fully wireless pc vr setup. But a BOBOVR halo headstrap and battery and your good to go for hours.

Great product. Used it for almost 3 weeks. $299 is not much expensive compared with a full set of Index VR($999). Of course, to play games on desktop, index can bring much better experience to players. However, comes to flexibility, Quest 2 is the best for now. No base station is required, just set up the guardian and play at anytime, anyplace. There are many games on oculus store, but they are not very attracted to me. I mostly used it to play desktop games as a replacement of index, my experience is great. Can go wired (oculus link, charging while playing) and fully wireless (air link).Overall, if you are that person like me, want to try VR but don’t want to invest much on it, Quest 2 could be the best option. I don’t like the Facebook company but I appreciate the Quest 2 develop team. They keep adding new features in each experimental update.

These are not worth $300 each. Its a shame you spend $600 and have to purchase 2 copies of the games to play them together. We have spent 2.5 hours on the phone with Customer Support, and absolutely zero help. They finally admitted that the system is broken and the expect it to work by 5/1.

It’s super fun and the graphics are amazing :)! I was afraid it would be too heavy but it’s very light. It’s comfortable to wear, but I would recommend a $30 elite strap because the white fabric strap gets very dirty and you can’t clean it nicely. An elite strap it also very helpful for active games. The battery time for the console isn’t very good, but there are cons to something as light and power consuming as this. Some elite straps have battery packs, but it’s probably not good for you to be in vr over 2 hours anyway and it might be uncomfortably heavy. The experience of vr is a MUST HAVE, and for 300 bucks and 128gb it’s a STEAL! If you plan to play games like beatsaber, definitely get controller protectors. I am impressed with their durability (I have SMASHED them super hard against each other and my walls) and they haven’t cracked yet but i’m going to quick buy some covers now to be safe. Over all, pretty much all cons are expected results of the pros, and I would recommend!

The image quality is good.  The controls are comfortable.  If you're looking for mobile VR, this will probably work, so long as you don't require a large library of games, because this device has only a handful of decent titles, and the rest of its library is of extremely low quality.Battery life is abysmal.  Device has serious power management issues.  The oculus link cable is advertised as charging it while you use the device.  This is a lie.  A blatant, bold-faced lie.  Don't waste your money on it.

I take the device out of the box, connect it to my homes wifi, and the thing refuses to install an update. Stuck at ""Update 1 of 2 0%"" for over an hour. I contacted support over the internet on my PC and they told me to do a factory reset. The thing is literally straight from the factory. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and followed the instructions for a factory reset. I reconnect to my home wifi and....still stuck at 0% update. I'm not sure what else to do.

In terms of the technology, this was everything I had hoped it would be.  The sound is amazing.  The graphics are crisp and clear.However, like many others, I developed a rash on my eyelids and around my eyes, despite using the silicone cover that was provided.Also ... if you wear eyeglasses,  the headset can be downright painful even when using the provided eyeglasses spacer.These two things were so bothersome they made the headset unwearable.

My 13 year-old son said this was his coolest Christmas present! All the adults have enjoyed playing it, too. We explored the world through the Wander app. We had so much fun watching each other, and got some great laughs. Beware if you add the roller coaster. I can’t believe how real it feels. I had horrible motion sickness after that one though. I seriously couldn’t believe that I felt like I was going down the tracks of a coaster while standing in the living room.The only downside for me is that most of the games that he wants cost around $25 or more.It does come with free games, but he gets tired of them pretty quickly.So parents heads up about the games. After you pay the price to buy the VR set, your kid is still going to be asking for more. If anyone figures out how to get a discount code for games, I’d love to know!Another positive would be that it’s actually getting my teen out of his room. He comes in the living room with me to play his games.

I was hesitant to make this purchase, as I was unsure what all I would need to get started, having never used VR before. I had been under the impression that one needed a gaming PC or equivalent console to be able to hook up just to be able to use it, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn this was not the case. I purchased this item almost immediately, and it has not disappointed! The effects and graphics are excellent, the tracking tech is decent, and there are several demos and free apps to get you started. Overall, this was an excellent purchase for a very reasonable price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get started with VR!

If your looking to get into VR, this is a great stand alone system. Have had over a month and still not bored of it yet.You can connect it to a PC if you want. I went with the higher memory so I wouldn’t have to worry about storage when buying games.The only down fall is the battery life. Out of the box without adjusting anything, and it ran for almost two 2 hours. Mix of simple games and setting up.Now with increasing hertz refresh and playing games, it last about 1.5 - 1.75 hours. To play longer you can purchase the small battery packs (work great also) to extend the life.The headset only storage is the box it comes with. So don’t throw it out. They sell a kit with better head straps and a battery attached. That is my next purchase for this.Overall very good product and happy with it.  For my first time joining VR this was perfect. I can even take this other places and play with friends. Just be ready to pick up 1-2 accessories and have a Facebook account.

I would give this Headset a 5 star but there are some pros and cons.Pros:1. Very user friendly, it gives an option to skip tutorials for more experienced users2. Inexpensive compared to other headsets especially standalone with no wires3. The built in speakers are amazing!4. The controllers are very durable, I’ve hit my walls on accident multiple times really hard, and they still work fine5. Very customizableCons:1. Even with the glasses spacer it is not very friendly for glasses users2. Lenses fog up INSANELY quick3. Built in battery life only lasts about 2-4 hours4. The stock headset straps are really uncomfortable after long use and the headset doesn’t really sit securely5. This has only happened a couple times to me, but it is a serious problem. When playing, the headset loses tracking of the controllers for a couple seconds, then they work just fine. I don’t know if this is from smacking them up against a wall or the sensors problemBesides all of the cons, this headset is DEFINITELY worth it. I got addicted instantly and it’s a great way to work out and play games at the same time. It is a PERFECT gift for anyone. I recommend buying a couple additional things like the elite strap and a charging dock, other than that, this thing is amazing! 10/10 would buy another.

The Quest is great and we are quite enjoying it but I am pretty certain the package I received was used. The charging cable was outside of the included accessories box and strewn across the top of the headset and controllers. The included silicone cover had some random hairs on it that looked to be from a pet, and the enclosed instructions cards/manuals were haphazardly inside the box. the item itself seems to work fine so far, but was still surprised to receive such a pricey item packaged like this.

I have a good time with the quest.  I use it more for fitness but do play some games with friends and I've been starting to use it for work.  There is a lot more to do with this other than gaming.  However, if you wear glasses I would highly suggest get an updated prescription and buy prescription inserts.  I did not use it for months until I got some.  The original quest had far better room and better p.d. adjustments.  If you try this with glasses you will have comfort issues and easily scratch the vr lenses.

LO BUENO:Simplemente la mejor compra en gaming que he hecho en años, en cuanto a independencia, tecnología, calidad y precio.Estéticamente me encantó, colores sobrios, muy buena calidad, si nunca habías probado la realidad virtual como yo, te sentirás muy inverso en los lentes, tanto así que hasta golpeé todo lo que tenía a mi alrededor sin querer, y tanto a los lentes como a los mandos, no les ocurrió nada, ni un rasguño.Con la memoria de 256 gb, más que suficiente, super fluido, rápido, cómodo, INTUITIVO sobre todo.LO MALO:Esto la verdad es que es más personal, y no para todos, sino para la minoría, encontraremos que el sistema elástico de las gafas, resulta muy incómodo, hasta llegar a doler la zona donde se apoya en nuestra cabeza.De igual forma la esponja donde apoyas tu rostro, en lo personal es molesta, y me causó dolor y un poco de irritación en cortos periodos de uso, lo bueno es que viene con una funda de silicona, muy fácil de colocar y soluciona TODO, literal, muy bueno y viene incluido.El aparato, luego de mucho uso y de exigirlo con juegos que piden un poco más que el resto, se calienta, hasta llegar a dar calor en la zona de los ojos, lo cual es muy entendible si lo estamos exigiendo de forma independiente. Desconozco si sucede lo mismo cuando lo usamos con PCVR.Puede ocasionar mareo en un principio, en lo personal, bastante, hasta tener que acostarme, porque la vista la sientes super rara, sientes el cuerpo raro, ves tus manos y piensas que no son tuyas, un mareo increíble, que por suerte solo me sucedió en un principio.COSAS QUE SON REALES PERO NO AFECTAN:Los gráficos no son nada increíble en algunos juegos, que si bien hay que entender que es un sistema que los corre de forma independiente, estos no son gráficos de ultima generación ni mucho menos, al contrario, hay juegos bastante pobres gráficamente. Sobre esto, nada que preocuparse, ya que la inmersión es tanta, que los gráficos es lo último en lo que te percatas, literal, puedes tirarte muchas horas en vrchat por ejemplo, y los gráficos seran lo de menos.El tracking o seguimiento del cuerpo, es solo de brazos hacía arriba, pero muy buenos, así que ni lo sientes, en lo personal si compraría más accesorios para trackear el cuerpo, pero desde luego no es nada necesario.Eso es todo, si quieres comprarlo, en lo personal es muy bueno, además es increíble que me salga el doble de barato que comprandolo en mi país y encima siendo la mejor versión, incluso pagando la tasa de importación.PD: el envío fue lo mejor, era envío gratis y me llegó en 7 días,  un amigo realizó la misma compra, envío gratis y le llegó en 4 días, nada, la mejor experiencia en todas sus partes.

We love it so much that we got 2 more so we can have friends over and he/she can use the third one. It was not hard to follow the onscreen instruction to get it set up, but it was a bit confusing at first when trying to pair with your phone. You definitely need facebook for now to be able to sign in and use it.The games are fun, we play a lot of mutiplayer games, and for those who suffers motion sickness like I do (I have ringing ears and vertigo, get yourself a fan blowing at yourself plus take some of those verb liquid for motion sickness that you can rub behind your ears), they will help or get games that have teleport feature.The headset is bad, consider getting a more comfortable headshet or it will feel very front heavy. The bettery life for the head unit is about 2hrs. while the batteries can last over a month of here and there using it.One thing though, if you PLAN to share the quest 2 with another person, the 128g will be divided by 2 users (meaning, each user will have 64g of space for games and such), and if you have three people sharing one, it will devide the space for 3 users... so you have limited space. That said, if you plan to share it with 3 users and creating 3 acounts on one quest 2, you can set primary and share that to the other two users within the headset, and if that's the case, get the 256g one for 3 users sharing would be my suggestion.

Lets me first start off by saying if it wasn't for the painfully short battery life on this thing, it would be 5 stars. My only other complaint is the elastic band. I have a lot of hair and it slips off my head a little too often during high movement games like beat saber especially if you start to sweat, the headset is front heavy and starts to slide down your face which can really jack up your vision during some games. Constantly having to fix it isn't really convenient. However, all that aside, the quest is fun and works well.

The adjustable straps that help tighten/loosen it around your head is a nice little touch. The only thing that i dislike about it is how fast it dies. Playing it continuously for two hours minimum drains the battery significantly. On the contrary, it does not take long to charge back up to 100. Another thing i like is the amount of battery life the controllers have. The controllers come with batteries already in them and do not die quickly. Another thing, the tracking is pretty good. There are a few glitches here and there but as long as you are in proper lighting the tracking works great.

The thing I like best is that it contains a web browser. I can watch Netflix, log onto my Facebook account, virtually anything I can do with my laptop, I can do with Quest 2. It also is backward compatible with my old VR set, which allows me to use all of the Apps I bought for it. I just turn on my laptop and link my Quest 2 to the laptop using the app that comes with Q 2. Couldn't be happier.

First Time With VR Easy To Setup for direct use, But Facebook Instantly Banned My Account When I made It, and due to it being the weekend I had to wait till Monday (I think I set it up on Friday evening), it works well but I was pretty upset that it took so long to get it ready for PC use. I wish the battery would stay alive while using it in my PC, perhaps I need a more powerful USB power port as the wall outlet works fine with perpetual use (though I can't tolerate it after like 2 hours). It's cheap, works and it's not a bad first experience. If you don't mind facebook as a company I guess you won't mind this one.

Facebook deactivated our 2 accounts after only 3 days of having the oculus, making these very expensive paper weights. The reason they deactivated us was they didn’t recognize our new computers that we logged onto FB. There isn’t a support chat our number to call to get it fixed either. Maybe they would have reinstated us but it’s scary that we could have spent $1000 on games and they can just deactivate us with no reason at any time. Facebook is cancer. We knew singing back on FB for this was a bad idea and should have followed our guts. It would have saved us a lot of trouble. We’re just going to hold out for the Apple one coming out this year.

This is amazing! My boyfriend absolutely loved is as a Christmas gift. Because the quest 2 is a mix of a console itself and a VR headset you can hook up to your computer, there are pros for buying games either through the oculus store or through steam. I suggest getting simple party games through oculus (ie job simulator) and buying games that can be modded on steam (ie boneworks).However, while there are some games that don’t require any distance moment (such as walking/running) a lot do and they’re very disorienting if you get motion sick. A pretty good indicator of whether or not you’ll be sick when playing on the quest 2 is if you get dizzy watching videos that are POV/spin frequently (ie the movie Mad Max)

This is a great entry level VR headset for kids and adults.  Like others have said the only downside is that you need a Meta (Facebook) account.  If you are tech savvy you can create a simple gmail and Meta account that does not get flagged. (Very easy if you are worried about privacy).  Told they will be removing this requirement in the future.  Provides hours of fun.  Highly recommend getting the Link cable so you can connect to pc and play other games.  May actually buy another just so we can play against each other as a family or when the kids have friends over.  Definitely recommend as you will not be disappointed for the price.

I don’t typically get motion sickness, but boy oh boy, Oculus has made me queasy a bunch of times. So do it in short time frames consistently.Also if you have glasses, it’s a bit tricky, even with the headset accommodation. I thought I’d exercise some but my glasses just fog up and the fit is odd.So I’ve enjoy the 360 videos (relaxing) on YouTube and I loved the rollercoaster (until I got motion sick).It will take some getting use to. But I love it even with the quirks.

I love that Saber Beat game, and I love the Jurassic Park World, just unreal on how this fun game is for Seniors..haha, I can even do my exercise without going to the gym.

OMG, this is the bomb! I never care for video games or understood what the big deal was about them until I play the Quest. This system is awesome. It allow me to step out of reality for a few minutes. I find myself staying on it until the battery dies. I truly enjoy this game system.  I even brought all the accessories so I would not have a reason why I couldn't play or enjoy the full effect of the scenarios. It is something worth experiencing.  It is a good investment.....at least it was for me.

I had been waiting for a headset that balanced mobility and affordability before I jumped into the VR world, and this is it!! Having the whole system in the headset is a big game changer, and the battery life is long enough to get some good plays in (and short enough to remind me to take a break!). I thought the memory would be an issue, but 128 is plenty for the current VR game landscape. Overall super satisfied and would totally recommend!

-Much heavier than the oculus rift. You'll be feeling it on your face the entire time.-No earphones; another step down.-Extremely fragile components-Cheap plasticy feel. Seems like they cut corners in production.-Setup is a nightmare. When trying to pair it to your phone, as required, be wary of it bricking your device like it did mine. One factory reset and half a dozen attempts later, it finally connected for updates.-Charger cable is the shortest I haver ever seen-No visual indication on the plugs or ports what is right side up; bend an internal pin and you're paying for repairs or buying a new one.-Glasses spacer leaves about an inch extra where you nose should be, if you're secretly a bird then its just perfect for fitting your beak-Controllers are weirdly shaped. They don't feel natural in your hand at all.+ It powers on quickly+ The visual quality is a step up from the rift.+ The airlink allows you to connect to your pc without any additioonal cable, albeit with high requirements from both system performance and net speed.+ The calibration of Guardian was quick and painless compared to the rift, with obvious improvements in functionality. You're given the option to physically map the floor location,  and 'spray' on the boundary lines from a distance.I would suggest looking into other options in addition to the quest 2, then choose what features and drawbacks you can live with.

Once you figure things out (or, as I did, let my kids figure it out, then show me) the Oculus is a blast.  It is one step closer to the Oasis (from the book Ready Player One) (don't bother with the sequel book, it stunk).  The unit controls and hand controls are simple to use, and the pre-loaded games are enough to get going right out of the box.  Need a separate device if you want to cast to a tv, but they are inexpensive.  As a surprise gift to the family at Christmas, it was a big hit.

Yeah, its freedom unlike never before, but theres only like 20 games, if you want more games, real games. You have to do a bunch of extras to attempt to get more games hooking it up to a pc buying extras to maybe get more games, then you dont have that freedom anymore. Not enough game demos. The movement is idiotic especially in resident evil 4. The list goes on the prices for games are way to high. The free games suck. Is it worth the money, no. Watching movies or browsing the internet is just a big screen far to close to the eyes. Nothing about this product is magical. Am i writting this review to be helpful, kind of, but no.

This is the perfect headset for anyone looking to get into virtual reality. It only takes 10-15 minutes to set up, and is very easy to use. It's wireless, and you don't need anything else to get playing, just the headset. Within 10 minutes I was fully set up and playing a climbing game. If you have a VR-Ready PC then you have the option to use a feature called Airlink where you can play PC-Exclusive games on your Quest 2 wirelessly. I definitely recommend buying this headset, especially at the amazing price of $299.Some games I recommend: Eleven Table Tennis, The Climb 2, Superhot VR, Beat Saber, Gorn, Rec Room, VR Chat, Pavlov Shack, and Boneworks (PC-Exclusive)

I bought two sets for my Sons family . EVERYBODY loves them. The neighborhood kids are always at my Sons playing anyway and I knew an extra set would come in handy ! But there are still kids and adults waiting to try them out. I have some and it is awesome . I can see myself getting into a game with people from all over and not wanting to stop. For one of my grandsons it was so real to him , that in one of the games he walked off a cliff , and he he fell to the floor,  his legs giving out because he ,for a few seconds, thought he was falling.  Oh just when you get yours be sure and get the head lining piece. It makes it so much more comfortable. I don't see anyone not liking this .

I don't use this headset a whole lot, but it's still pretty cool. There just isn't a lot of content yet, and the content that is there costs money, so I mainly use it to watch anime and talk on VRChat, which is free. For what it's worth, the graphics are really good. I remember playing a VR game with a headset back in the 90s at a carnival or something, and this blows those old graphics out of the water. Tech really has come a long, long way. Now the question becomes: Is VR going to be a passing fad, or will lots of people start using it in their daily lives? As of now, I use it maybe once or twice a week, and I can't say I'd ever use it more than that. Then again, though, that's what I said about Facebook back in the day, and look where we are now.

If you buy another game through another vendor, please note that this device is NOT going to make things easy for you. Nothing has been streamlined at all.In theory, the Quest 2 makes perfect sense.

I love the Oculus Quest 2 so far - mostly.  Connecting it to my PC via the link cable (USB C to 3.1) or AirLink both give me problems.  There is also some confusing info on the support page, however the product itself is really solid. Good visuals, lightweight, controllers work very well.  Everything so far has been impressive from watching 3D movies, to games (like RE 4 VR).At $299 it is well worth the money just don't plan on receiving any promotions that amazon promises with it.

State of the art item that seems so much more advanced than the original oculus rift. No wires, sensors to set up, nothing. Just turn on and play. because the headset itself is the console. The spacer for eyeglasses is what sold me, but if you have a large glasses, maybe try buying prescription lenses (yes, that's a thing!) for about $30. You can insert the lenses and play without your glasses! Hoping more games come out soon. Especially social interactive ones where friends can play with you on their phones.

I first got into VR several years ago with the original Vive, which I paid $600 for. And at the time that was a good price. But what many of us in VR agreed on is that while the tech is great, we need more people using it. We need more gamers and developers in the VR space, and $600 on top of a gaming PC, with a wire leading to the tower and laser devices to screw to your walls, it was never going to happen.The Quest has solved all of this. At a price point of $300 for the newest quest, you absolutely cannot match this value with any other VR hardware. On top of that, you don't need a gaming PC at all; this system is ready to boot and play for any adult or child right out of the box. This is absolutely revolutionary. And since we have the privilege of buying in 2021/22 instead of a few years ago, you're paying $300 (or less on sale) for a headset that is more capable in every way than the Vive I paid $600 for a few years ago. Compared to the Vive it is lighter, cooler, more comfy, has more naturally ergonomic controllers, and here's the big one: higher pixel density and virtually no screen door effect.You are stealing this device from facebook for $300.

I am new to the VR world. I am so amazed at how great it is. I love that you can do other things besides play games. Directions could have been a little bit clearer on certain things but I figured it out thanks to YouTube. I do recommend getting the elite strap with battery. You’ll need the extra battery life and it’s more comfortable.  Also get a better silicone VR face mask with the nose enclosure.

I bought this so that I could play VR Chat on the Oculus since PSVR didn’t have it. It’s quite amazing, the graphics itself are amazing and the best part about it is that it’s all WIRELESS so I don’t have to worry about tangled wires or tripping over them. I never understood why people were so frustrated about using a Facebook account, just either use your Facebook account or create one and that’s all, it’s not like it’s stealing your information or asking for your whole phone number or SSN. It’s such a simple setup and an even better VR Experience. I cannot wait to start playing Resident evil 4 VR on here. Best $300 I ever spent!!!!

It is nice that I was able to log in to my FB account on both, and when we download a new game it gives the option of installing the game on both or just on one.

The Quest II is built solidly, if you want a budget VR headset for a child this would be it. It's standalone which means no gaming PC is required but one can be connected should you wish to play SteamVR games.But this is at the cost of requiring a Facebook account for regular use. This is non-negotiable and is an absolute travesty. I have tried out the little loophole method of installing an older Oculus app on the phone but all that resulted in was the VR headset automatically factory resetting after each power down and restart.Go away Zukker.

To put it simply, this headset is great if you want to play supported apps on the device itself. Anything outside of that is luck of the draw. I primarily bought this to pair up with my pc as affordable as it is in comparison to other VR products. My computer is up to spec for VR and I have a USB C cable that transfers 2.5 GB/s. It won't work as they say it will. I have heard through the internet that others have had similar issues as me. Airlink worked for the first day I had it but no longer works either. Tried ensuring my pc and software were as up to date as possible, reinstalling drivers, different cords, reinstalling drivers from device manager, disabling discrete graphics, etc etc. Trust me as a programmer/IT guy I tried a good 8 hours of various troubleshooting but it will not work. Avoid this product if you are buying to use with a PC. Your mileage may vary but I was only able to connect and use it once through airlink and only once at that. Also last I checked their support page is broken so good luck getting into support. Extremely disappointed on the false advertising of how simple and easy it is to use with PC. I'll choose differently next time.

When you use the headset with glasses you also can't move your eyes, you have to look straight the whole time or the image will become super blurry.

The tech is very good. As many have said head strap changes , battery add ons may enhance your experience. Biggest cons: don’t expect to put this on the market and expect kids to not ask for this, especially if they see it in another household. That is what happened to us.  The lack of timers/ parental controls on like on every other major platform is a major problem. It’s coding a lot of fights to turn it off, and my kids have manage to download inappropriate content despite trying to watch while it is casting on the TV ( the tv doesn’t show someone’s peripheral view and everything they are clicking on)

This headset is terrific. I need to wear glasses most of the time, but this headset works fine without them. The resolution is great for the most part, thought text is a little hard to read if it's further than around 60 centimeters away, and the controllers feel great. I have 3 gripes, however. Firstly, the FOV is quite bad and I often get annoyed by how little I can see with my peripheral vision.On top of this, the headstrap hard to adjust and feels like it might fall off my head at any moment, and moving my head at any significant speed bumps it around and I have to readjust it (on a side note, I would recommend using the top strap to hold it on your head. Don't keep the headset pulled onto your face with the side straps. Those are to stop it moving around).And Finally, there is a lot of light that gets let in at the bottom of the headset and is quite distracting.In conclusion, the software and hardware of the headset itself is almost perfect, but the things surrounding that are less-than-stellar. I'd certainly recommend this headset though, as it is very cheap for what it is and only requires a single cable to connect it to your PC if you want to use Link. On a sidenote of using Link, don't use the cables on your case. Use the ones on your MOBO. This stopped my link from constantly crashing and reconnecting.

The device works as well and smoothly as i'd hope, but the fact that all things in the market place are no less than 12 dollars, often times more than 20, makes it feel like I payed 400 dollars for something i can explore inch by inch. There are free things like VR chat, and roller coaster vr but it's not worth 400 dollars. The games I paid for were amazing and fun, but I'd appreciate a little more than just watching tv in vr and trying to get VR chat to stop closing.My biggest issue however is the inability to be flexible for mods and custom works that are legal. I spent almost 2 hours googling and reading to only come out with a headache and countless pages on how to set up a group for making and selling games and content on the store, just to download mods and expand my fun with the device.Overall I'd say you can buy it as long as you have the 400 dollars and about 60 or 70 dollars extra to spend on the marketplace.

You should, you must experience the VR !!!And Oculus Quest is the cheapest way, i think... Its own games are great, but you can also buy the same games from Steam Store and download into the console. Yes it like a console, and another great thing is, it is standalone, you don't need any cables or something else.When you want to connect to PC, you can establish a connection with Airlink. It's also wireless!! But the disadvantage is Airlink drains the battery very well, like drinking it :)I've tried the Euro Truck Sim with a beta VR uptade and I'm shocked... Because when you watch the VR videos on YouTube or similar platforms, you couldn't see the true VR vision, because the monitors draws only 2D views, but in the VR set, there is a 3D modelled view, and it feels also very real.When i played ETS, i feel like i'm in the truck cabin, and i tried to touch the steering wheel :)I recommend every player, it's a great product.

Trying on the quest 2 for the first time was a very awesome experience. I had trouble making everything look clear. If i tried turning my eyes to look at something it would look grainy/blurry. I would need to turn my head to directly look at what i wanted to look at with clarity. I got the hang of it but after using it for 3x, about 30mins to an hour each time, i would always feel nausea/motion sickness. My eyes would feel strain as well. And if your wondering i would set the headset off my eyes and onto my head throughout the playtime, either during loading times, death in games, or just to drink some water or talk to family. I never thought a gaming product would make me feel sick like this. Im use to playing on my ps4 for more then 2hrs.Other than the nausea i felt like there was a lack of content on the store to purchase and very few youtube videos you were able to watch from. Also i imagined more control over my animated hands in a few games and free trails but you were restricted to a few hand gestures... it was a nice experience still and definitely on the right track but i will wait untill the technology is there to make the vr feel more immersive and enhance the visuals.

Got this for my husband for the holidays. Our kids get two weeks off for the holiday break and between the 4 of us, I think it was used pretty much all our waking hours. The graphics were way better than I expected and my kiddos used it so much, their arms got a workout! Because of Covid, it really did help pass the time and the boys surprised me as they did not argue for more time, but were excited to take turns and share their experiences after their turns.

This thing is awesome! I love how not only can my son or I enjoy playing games, but the family can also. There are many multi-player games and single player games and you can play a ton of them offline!The only thing is for a new product I think it messes up a bit often. It crashes at least once every few days and will randomly black out as though thinking the user took the headset off often.My family has been using it since Dec 24, 2021.

Honestly I've been looking into VR for a long time, and this has to be one of the best ways to enter the VR scene. It performs incredibly well standalone; as well as when connected to a high powered pc. This is the best cheap option for VR that exists.The whole Meta thing is a bit of a bummer, as having to have facebook to use it is a bit rough. But those shortcomings are not something to hesitate over. This thing is WELL worth the money.This isnt high end VR, but thats not what its for. So if you're in the market and are looking for something cheap and easy to use, GET THE META QUEST 2 NOW.

This is not the first time I tried vr. But before it's with my phone. This one set with hand I can actually hold a pingpong ball with left hand and right hand with the bat. I feels good. And for the shooting game. It changes everything. Can you imagine shooting like John wick in another game. Although, the resolution still not natural enough. You still can feel the pixels. And if you watch movie . It's like we are back to 90s. anyway. It's still a good investment for beginners

I've toyed around with VR here and there since the late 90s. Prototypes at science centers to the Nintendo virtual boy to cell phone kits to the Oculus rift developer and consumer models. All have been enjoyable, but the virtual boy and cell phone models were too basic, and the prototypes and rift being tethered limited the immersion. Finally, the quest 2 comes along gives a really great experience both as a stand-alone device for more basic games and a wireless pcvr device for the higher end games. Right now it's the best option available for great vr experience. Highly recommend.

I've had so much fun with this thing.  Such a great value.  Hoping the next version has additional cameras for tracking as I play a ton of first person shooters and when you have your trigger hand up where it's supposed to be, the tracking is subpar as there really is only one camera that can see your controller when it's up there by your chin.  So your gun will start moving around without your hand moving.  It's super obnoxious 5% of the time.

What an absolute POS. I solely bought this because I was so thrilled to play resident evil 4. It played it amazing for the first week I had it. Let it sit for about 2 months or so as I had to move and had other things such as work to take care of. Now turning it back on it’s plagued by updates that won’t finish and games that won’t update either. I’ve hard reset it everything you can imagine and it’s still a brick…. Also no way to clear app cache, meaning any game application that you have that it decides it can’t open or play anymore has to be re downloaded and good luck with that. It’s a shame. You’d think a tech giant this big would know better? I guess the moral of my experience is it’s great in the beginning but don’t ever let it sit or it will brick itself with mountains of unnecessary updates that the system can’t recover from.

I never thought I would enjoy virtual reality. It always looked clunky and outdated. Once I signed into my new Oculus Quest 2 my opinion was swayed. The graphics have come a long way and more and more innovative games are being released every day. I can feel like a real life Alien-hunter or medieval warrior. This was the prefect gift for me, an avid game who is looking for something ew and surprisingly enjoyable.

Absolutely amazing but uncomfortable. Awkward strap and it gets hot fast. Within my first few minutes of playing it it got so hot I had to turn it off. Needs some kind of ventilation and it's messed up that you have to spend so much more money trying to make it more practical. Light weight controllers but feel very weak. Blurry unless sitting 100% perfectly. Guardian gets stuck so low and even resetting it won't help. Only fixed it twice. Maybe I received one that just wasn't as how it should be.

There are apps for meditation, exercise, social platforms, games, movies and more. There are a lot of free ones and the pay apps are very reasonable.The 2 things for parents to be (pretty) cautious of are the social platforms and the time allowed in vr.

Disappointed the way this product arrived. Box ripped, parts of item thrown back in box, obviously it was returned and sent back out without the condition of the product even checked. This was bought as a gift for my son and arrived the day before his birthday.  I did give it to him and he says it’s functioning properly, no damage, he had to factory reset it someone else registered the product in there name. If your going to resend returned products to other customers as a new item then inspect the item and make sure that’s the way it’s arriving, it’s a pricey investment to arrive the way it did.

LOL Anytime  I put the Oculus on, I play some games and watch some videos or movies and then t thing I know it’s 5 hours later lolCouple things about this particular brand I am not fond of is it does not Bluetooth to my Samsung TV without a chrome cast. If I cast it to my iPhone, I have to mirror it that way to my TV but the quality is horrible and the sound does not cast to TV still. I also wanted to use my new MacBook to stream or play online games through headset but have not found a way to do that without having a gaming PC. Also I am not impressed by the Battery life AT ALL! I feel like I am. Hanging it more then I get to use it if I do t have it plugged in while using it. Just kind of kills a lot when your in the middle of a game and you battery is low and 5 mins later it shuts down.

It is actually insane how amazing and futuristic this device is. The surround sound is great, the movements are flawless, the battery lasts long enough. It did make me motion sick (I lived on a boat for 3 months without getting seasick but this got me), I followed a tip and played in smaller increments until I got used to it. Now it doesnt make me sick at all. The headset could be more comfortable but it is not uncomfortable. The lenses get sweat on them because the mask is ""hot."" You dont really feel like its hot but at some point you will notice you are sweating. A good workout but it does make the lenses need to be wiped every so often.Still, five stars. This device could have many more issues and it would still not lose a star. It is so insane for its price, and just as a device in general, it should get 15 stars.

The oculus quest 2 is great. The charge, though only lasting 2-4 hours is more than enough time for me. Shooter games like onward or Pavlov are very good. You need the oculus app and a Facebook acct. but it wasn't too terrible to setup. When I first put it on it updated which only took a couple of minutes but that might vary depending on your internet. You need a bright room for it to track properly so I recommend getting a bright light. The gap in the nose area doesn't bother me but there is a gap there so when I'm playing and I turn towards a light it distracts me. The graphics aren't the best but you can't expect too good of graphics from a tiny screen being magnified. The controllers are comfortable but once your hands get sweaty it becomes a little uncomfortable

I have found navigating through the system is somewhat difficult.  My biggest problem I have with the Oculus is the quality of the visual.  I find it blurry no matter how I adjust the unit.  The battery does not last long.  I played for about 45 minutes yesterday and the battery was down to about 50%.  I was also starting to get a headache from the blurriness.

Pro: The Headset is fantastic and work perfectly. Battery lasts for about 2 hours on a full charge which is more then enough. Love works well on PC with a Link Cable (Even with 3rd party cable). Airlink works somewhat ok, however it is still in beta.Cons: Why does Meta require that I use Facebook to use the headset that I paid for? It is ridiculous that I don't get the option to turn off social settings. I have an Oculus Account, but Meta forces you to merge it to a Facebook account. I would have given this a 5 out of 5, but Facebook can't resist on getting access to personal data. If Facebook got rid of that requirement, this would be the best headset to buy on the market.

This is so much better than PS VR in terms of setup, connection and visual quality. The freedom of movement without any wires and tracking is amazing.AirLink works great, no complaints from me.Battery lifetime is acceptable, but it can discharge pretty quickly just lying there.The ability to view the actual space around you with external cameras is a lifesaver.The stock head strap is abysmal, the headset is practically constantly weighing down on your face, and you need to adjust it every couple of minutes.It's nearly impossible to wear it with glasses, the frame is just not big enough.It has some issues correctly identifying floor level in seated position. And if there is no setting for this in the game, you will view the world as a leprechaun.I don't like the required integration with Facebook, but it is what it is.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, the device is marvelous for it's price. I like the PC VR games, I like the standalone capabilities and what I can do with it. I just need to get a new head strap.

For an item that costs $300, I expected more than this. Me and my children played on the oculus for about 5 hours when it needed to be recharged. After charging, it would not detect the left controller. Kept saying that the battery was low, even after replacing the battery. Yes, I was using alkaline AA 1.5v. I tried unpairing and repairing...tried it after keeping the batteries out for 5 minutes. Tried factory resetting the headset. Nothing works. I can only surmise that the controller is faulty. After some searching on the web, I find out that this is a very common issue.Then, when I go to report a problem....""Oh, we'll get back to you in 1 or 2 days."" No number. No live chat. Just support tickets. Horrible customer service. I would skip shelling out the money for this system until they get this fixed. It's completely ridiculous.

It was very disappointing when we received the unit missing the charger and found two or three inch long dark hairs on the facemask. Clearly seems to be a returned unit when it should have been new.  We packed it back in the box and took it to UPS an hour after we received it. Still have not received the refund.  We want to try again but not until we receive our refund.  Not sure if this is an issue from the manufacture or from Amazon.

So works great or worked great. had it for like 2 months and was fantastic till the left controller stopped pairing. Did all the troubleshooting. No physical damage to the unit. Just defective. Ater 4 straight hours of a massive amount of back and forth between amazon and occulus support , Amazon said they were willing to replace the unit but I have to ship it to them from SA out of my own pocket. Simply wanted a replacement controller that wouldnt cost me a arm and a leg. Support was terrible. Kept passing me from person to person. Kept having to repeat everything. Why am I paying out of pocket for defective under warranty products? NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!

My son enjoys the product It is pretty cool and the graphics are better than I expected. However, it's also a little heavier all the headset than I expected and obviously very front heavy. But it is a remarkable piece of technology. And there are an ever-increasing amount of actual games to play Not demos and proof of concept type things although there are plenty of those. I mean legitimate games that you can play alone or with friends for many hours.

If you've ever considered VR, you should buy this. So much fun and games like Beat Saber and Eleven: Table Tennis are not only fun and entertaining, but a small workout as well. Visually this look really good. Controls work well as far as I can tell. I don't usually play for longer than about 45 minutes, but it makes me sweat really hard. Love, love, love this system. You need a Facebook account, but most people already have one. Buy it!

General opinion: more than satisfiedNegative:- glasses fog up (sometimes)- small screen resolution: the pixels are small, but they are still visible. Need: 2x the resolution- there is no eye tracking function, which is important to create the right focus on the image and for comfort.- if you learn something you need use information for real notices. It is not comfortable.  Transperent mode is bad now, but it's working.- there are few settings and apps yet.Positive:- changing the distance to the text is useful for the eyes- it's a good way to make ideal work environment. You can control visual and auditory stimuli. You can do an ideal room.✅- helm don't allow wrinkle your forehead. It's interesting)- you can use it to get rid your social phobias.✅- there are a lot of experimental function: hand tracking, second transperent mode with augumented reality, attaching mouse, mode with increased frame rate.Need addition tools:Bluetooth keyboard, comfortable helm mountThank you, guys!

I should have done more reasearch on this item, as it is the most inexpensive VR headset it was an attractive buy, however what they don't explicitly tell you is that you need a Facebook account just to open it.  I bought this for my son to use with video games and as he is a child, I was not about to get a facebook account for him to use it.  I also do not have a facebook account as i do not condone spying and collecting personal data.  If I had known the device would be dead in the water without a Facebook account I would not have bought it in the first place.  Buyer beware, the thing collects video feeds of your surroundings and your audio and stores them at facebook (meta). interestingly, they say they have one that doesne't need the account if you pay them an extra $500!!! suspicious.....

I got the Quest 2 on the 13th of January, and just after midnight, the headset shut off and no longer powered on or took a charge. I shipped it back to Facebook in order to get a repair or replacement and I got crickets. No emails about them receiving it or what options they can give me. I had to use their support chat to get any updates. The RMA email I received initially said it would take 5-7 business days to get my headset back when they got it. Then I started a support chat on the 2nd of February and they then said it would be 5 more business days before I got it back. I contacted them again after another two weeks to only find out it could be a month from them receiving the headset for me to get it back. It has been just over a month from them getting my RMA and I still haven't gotten any proper updates. I have just contacted them about a replacement or refund. I'm tired of waiting for a product I paid over 500 dollars for, only for it to stop working almost immediately.

This is the funniest game platform I've ever played. The unit is built very well and I have spent hours injoyin it already.

The Oculus Quest, it's not bad at all it just isn't what i expected. I could care less about the facebook mandatory connection at all. What I do care about is it's quality. I think the resolution of the product is below average. It is just blurry and I did try the 75 hertz setting but it still sucks. I get way to dizzy after each use and I would feel like puking after even just watching one YouTube video. It also hurts around my head and gives me a headache after I use it. Some games look nice. But some games also lag really badly which I resent. I feel like the games are choppy and get really boring really quickly. I returned it but I haven't got my money back so let's see where that gets me. I'd give the product a 4/10. It just isn't what I hoped for.

My son got one and I fell in love and had to order one myself. I get extremely motion sick and there is many things I can do on it that does not make me nauseous. You have to adjust the eyes perfect or it is blurry. It is very easy to use and fun. The face cover that does come on it though sucks and hurts my face. When you order your headset I would separately order a different face covering. Definitely worth the money!

If you’re looking to try VR for the first time, this is a fairly inexpensive introduction that is versatile and actually pretty powerful. You can use it with or without a PC. I do wish the wireless PC link was better, but the pc cord is long enough that you can use it wired when on pc.

Works well fun. You will want to buy the upgraded strap for the head. Strap that comes is hard to adjust between people. Bought a case the came with upgraded head strap that uses a knob on the back to tighten and loosen the oculus to your head. Also going to want to get a external battery takes it from 2 hours to 6. Used my cell external in my pocket and a long c cord. But they sell ones that just plug in that are small if you don’t like cords

Play solo, with friends or random people. It’s amazing.  You would think the screen is in your face, but it appears to be about ten feet away and about 90” big.

My kids love this. They are having so much fun playing different games. I like that there are few game options, and we are still exploring other things the VR can do, I'm excited to see some of the ""travel"" type experiences. I got motion sick from some games, but my kids are so far ok. The only drawback is the battery drains rather quickly, so the wait to charge has been challenging for my kids. We are trying a battery ""brick"" that they can wear in a backpack, that is helping.

If you’re on the fence about getting it and not sure what you’re going to do with it like I was, I suggest you save your money. It’s just an expensive niche toy tbh. Once the hype of having an oculus passed I stopped paying any attention to it. Now it just sits in the box beside my chair. A $350 cup holder. BUT if you have a purpose in mind for using it or think you’d enjoy the limited amount of games currently available then go for it. You won’t be disappointed. Whether you use it or not, it’s definitely cool as sh!t , especially the first time lol

The Headset is a great package for a wonderful VR experience, but a few minor issues put it off a bit for me. Personally, The head strap is a bit odd and doesn't provide a very comfortable experience when playing for long, but some cheap aftermarket accessories can fix that. Additionally, the store is a bit overpriced with some very lenient sales so I personally stuck with steam and the use of air link. Now, Airlink is a great software functionality, it just has many issues such as a weird wide FOV when looking through passthrough as well as plenty of visual glitches and some settings options that are impossible to change. But besides all of my messy criticism, it is a great head seat that will please most and is definitely a great VR experience.

So I bought this for my wife for Christmas, she loves it, it's great for VR Chat and other games.My main complaint, and if you are considering this for PC, definitely check to see if your GPU is supported by oculus. I wish I would have known that it wasn't compatible with the 1650 GPUs, which is weird considering they support the 1060 gou and I believe a few 900 series GPUs.But any way, she really wanted to play her steam games in VR on her computer, but sadly she can not do that.But it runs great as a stand alone unit, and for what apps you can get in the Oculus store, and she still enjoys it.

The Oculus Quest 2 is a revolutionary device that brings VR to the mass market. The competitive pricing plus a wide variety of apps on the oculus store makes Quest2 an all-in-one entertainment powerhouse. However, the device is not well designed for spectacle wearers. Even with the eyeglass spacer provided, it is a pain to fit the eyeglasses into the small headset, not to mention that my eyeglasses keep nudging my nose, making the VR experience very uncomfortable. Fortunately, I bought from VR WAVE a pair of Quest 2 prescription lenses insert which completely solves the problem. I ordered them on the VR WAVE website and the lenses are delivered in a week. VR WAVE tailor made prescription lenses inserts according to my eyes, and the lenses inserts can be attached easily onto the headset with the magnetic design. I no longer have to wear eyeglasses into VR and being “perfect vision” in VR brings the whole experience to another level. I think that Oculus can do better on the headset design as VR is still far from comfortable without the help of these accessories.

I contacted Oculus, and they sent me a packing slip to Fedex it over night.  That was about the only good thing that has happened. That was 22 days ago and the won't give me a strait answer.  They can't seem to tell me what the delay was where my system is and why they will not send out my replacement system.  Upon research I am far from being the only one this has happened to.

I was excited to try this so I bought one. Delivered quickly so great as always. When I opened it up it had a scratch on it (as shown in picture). The battery life of this VR headset is absolutely terrible. It needs to be able to last WAY longer. This headset is also bad for people with glasses. I have to take mine off just to use this even with the glasses insert attached. The last issue I have is being able to fit it on me perfectly to be able to see the screen and not have any blur; the part that hangs on my nose is never centered and always manages to close off my nostril so I’m always having to adjust it.

The Oculus headset offers something for everyone - games, workouts, puzzles, travel, events, social - and this market is just getting started.  Games are affordable (many amazing games are free!) and take up far less memory space than PC/console games.  I have 15 games/apps on a 128GB and have barely dented the capacity, although future games could get more memory intensive in the future...  highly recommend.

I have to balance my head back to keep goggles in a place where I can see and not have such a bad headache.

So far, it’s just okay. 1) I had to get a replacement because the black plastic contact strip broke off in one of the handsets so the headset couldn’t find it. 2) The upgraded headset strap is still designed so that I have a hard time keeping the mask on straight. I wouldn’t buy the extra headset strap again. The standard one is as good or better. 3) Why can’t we adjust each eye focus like binoculars?

Likes: Very easy setup as long as you have a decent wifi signal. All but the most popular games are relatively inexpensive. VR takes some getting-used-to, especially if you are past 70 but very rewarding with respect to emersion in the game.Cons: Requires a fair amount of empty space in your home if you want to play safely. Battery life, particularly for high-rez, fast action games is rather short.

Honestly, this Headset is pretty nice when you don't have a PC that would be able to run these games. The games arnt huge (with some only being a few gigs) and just are fun to play for hours.The only thing I have to say is if you get this might as well get a better headstrap because that one is just ok for the time being but can really hurt after a while. The battery life is ok aswell depends on what game you chose to play but really you should not play for more then 1-2 hours.When I first started to get into this, I will say after waking up the next day my brain couldn't figure out what was real or not so just keep that in mind. It goes away after a week of use just wish I was warned first.You will love it, your kids will love it, your grandma will love it, I'm 25 years old and thinks this kicks a**. Just look into it and see for yourself it's worth the buy and you will get lost in it.

My son and I both got one if these. After not much time, a month or 2 - the Operating System freezes, crashes, network won’t start, games won’t load, and then randomly it works again for maybe one or two sessions. We have factory reset our headsets twice and that did nothing but lose progress in my games. He can’t even play now because he is locked out his Facebook account (hacked)that he created for the Occulus and Occulus support won’t help him and there is no Facebook support. We are having to go to the Better Business Bureau to get refunds for his purchases or get a Facebook to verify his identity.  But it is fun when it works but lately, everytime I try to play I spend 20 minutes just powering down and restarting the headset until it works or I get frustrated.  I only have 3 games installed instead of all the games I had bough but that too doesn’t help.  Buyer beware, great technology but extremely buggy and if something happens to your Facebook account you will lose ALL of the games you have purchased.

This was a birthday present for our grandson. A friend of his came over and brought his set, watching these boys have so much fun made my heart happy. So when our grandson said this was what he wanted for his birthday, I could not resist and ordered them. It was his 18th so it was worth the big surprise!

I bought this mainly for PCVR and it performs really well for that even compared to stand alone headsets like the Vive and Index. What really impressed me is the library and performance with native quest titles. The work in progress features with refresh rate and side loading apps gives it even more versatility for app development and testing as well. No one can really compete with the quality and versatility that oculus/meta provides right out of the box with the quest 2. Hate Facebook or love them, they are investing heavily into VR and hopefully that will lead to only positive things.

I have the original Quest and it fits fine, but the Quest 2 headset is a little narrow and tight.  I have to wear an old set of glasses that aren't as wide to play on it, even with the glasses spacer inserted.  Once I get it on and adjusted it plays pretty well, but the right trigger finger button doesn't seem to work as well as the original Quest's.  I may have to contact Oculus.

For me, the Oculus was everything I wanted for a long time. I ended up buying one for Christmas and I love it so much. It had such a good value price that I couldn’t turn it down. It met every expectation that I wanted and I really enjoy using it! Something to keep in mind is that once you buy the headset, it still costs more money to buy games actually inside the headset. Sort of like an Xbox or PlayStation. You pay to get the actual thing, then whatever games you want. I hope this helped, but I definitely recommend.

This is an awesome system. I had experience with it before I bought my own. I bought the ""meta"" quest as it is now called however I played my previous roommates ""Oculus"" quest all the time. Near as I can tell, they're exactly the same. Only thing is, I literally spent all day playing his on my day off. Where as with the Meta quest, I feel like I only get maybe 2 hours out of it. Give or take. Maybe I've gone mad but I'm pretty sure the battery life in the Meta quest 2 is way worse than the original oculus quest 2. Why? I have no idea. That being said, it is still an incredible device. And besides the battery life, the only thing I would change right now is steam compatibility. There are many VR games in steam and if you could have the whole steam library on the Quest, it would bring in a lot of users

I set up my Oculus during Christmas and with kids and family members around and everything being non-stop I couldn't remember my password and pin number.  I have requested over 20 times to have an email sent to me via forgot password and not one time have I gotten the email.  Also Oculus told me they don't even see an account for me, yet when I am on the app, which logs me in automatically I can see my username, credit card info, etc.  Customer service is the same ol people who don't know anything and constantly repeat themselves or make 0 sense.

And at first I absolutely love the oculus immersive environments and gameplay among friends until The oculus decided to no longer be able to track the controllers or my hands for that matter and then got stuck in a boot loop. After spending several hours with tech-support for meta-they were unable to resolve my issue so now I have a $300 piece of crap that I can’t even watch YouTube on because it is constantly turning off turning back on and when it does stay on it is in a loop for tracking loss I have done everything from clean the cameras to replace batteries factory resetting I even use my cell phone to look through the camera at the oculus controllers to make sure the IR lights are still working.

The Metaverse will have to wait. I bought a brand new Oculus Quest 2 and have never been able to use it. Once I did the setup and hooked it to WiFi, it stated ""Apply update 1 of 2, rebooting in 10 seconds"". Then it proceeds to count down and reboot, then it just keeps rebooting every 10 seconds until the battery dies which takes days. Did the factory reset, connected directly PC and same issue. Oculus support says I have to send it back and they may give me a refurbished one. I didn't pay for a brand new one for it be a PoS and then give me a used one. Facebook making anything seems to suck and this Oculus Quest 2 is no different. Extremely disappointed and do not recommend!

The setup looks great and the music is nice too but i cant give this more than 2 stars. EDIT: I got it setup with a friends phone and it wont let me buy any games or apps. I enter my card details and it gives a vague error message i made sure i typed it right and tried on multiple games yet nothing went through not on the website, app, pc app, or in headset store. I looked online and on the forums and Oculus Support was unresponsive. This headset is over rated and a mess I wish I went with valve on this one.

This is the perfect headset to use to get into VR. Easy to set up and use. Fun games and stunning visuals.My only complaint is the price of games. Some of these games are completed in 30 minutes and have zero replay ability but still cost upwards of $20. It’s hard to justify a $40 purchase when I’ll only play the game for 30-45 minutes.I would be glad to see demos, free games, more affordable games. This comes down to a problem of Facebook being what they are(greedy) and developers underestimating costs of development.If I start to see more affordable games. I may come back and change my review.

The Meta Quest is exactly what my title implies. It's exciting when you first get set up and go into your first VR experience. In my case, ""First Steps"". And after playing different genres from Population 1, Cards&Tankards, and Trover Saves the Universe..VR and specifically The Quest 2 is primed to blow up in popularity very soon. The ""Future"" of gaming does comes with some con's though...battery life out of the box leaves a lot to be desired (2 hours of play time), do not expect graphics to blow you away, VR gaming is still relatively new. But seamlessly being able to party up and play video games in this VR viewpoint with friends is where this really shines. If you're a gamer, and haven't bought one yet, you are sorely missing out on a corner of gaming that is slowly becoming a must-have for gamers and casuals alike. Buy one now!

This thing is a good buy for the price, just make sure you have the space for it too.Battery life is always going to be a concern with every mobile platform, but the battery will need to be charged up first time as recommended just like anything else. Afterward sould last a good 8 or more hours.After it will connect to your desktop via cable or air link and works without issue for me.Steam VR is pretty good with it, break in your Quest 2 so you and it can sync.Use the hand control instead of the controller but only if the game supports hand gesture control.Would buy again.

I enjoyed the device while it worked but after 5 days of use the right controller had internal issues where it would spin me in circles without me touching the controller. As a result I decided to send in the controller for repairs. That was on the 12th of January and it is now February 5th. The most I’ve gotten was an email saying sorry. I’ve sent around 10 emails and the response I get is that the specialist team is working on it. I don’t understand the difficulty replacing a controller but I’ve been unable to use my headset for close to a month now. I’m very disappointed with the support on this device.

You can set the games to play easy levels or advance yourself to more of a challenge. If the gym isn't your thing but you want some exercise with your arms/legs, this is the system for you!

While I'm not always the biggest Facebook fan this headset is very impressive for the price. Prior to this I had the PSVR but had a hard time getting into it. The tracking on the Quest 2 is vastly superior and the ability to play with out wires is a huge game changer. Definitely recommend the Quest 2 for those looking to dip their toes into VR at an affordable price.

The overall experience of the headset is great. Hate having to use Facebook to use the headset but there are ways around using your main account if you don’t want to. 2 days after owning the oculus my left controller started drifting which was really annoying, some electrical contact cleaner in the joystick fixed that though. Still enjoy my purchase, it’s fun, visual quality is good and price point is good compared to some other units.

Who wants this level of intrusion into one’s life????  This VR headset offers great tech being sold at MUCH less than it costs to make.  Why???  Privacy and your personal data.  Despite carefully setting everything to not share my data I was constantly given reminders of friends VR units and what they were playing.  Basically if you use it, they will take ur data and sell it to you, ur friends on Facebook and advertisers. I felt violated.

I am shocked at how blurry the images are. Halos of light, text that can't be read, always moving my head around trying to find a remedy. Tried all the different eye spacings, multiple positions on my head, and different band tightness. I even went out and researched, finding that there are A LOT of complaints about these very issues, many of the reviewers stating that they didn't have these problems with the predecessor model. Fortunately, I can still return this.

I tried a friend's pair before buying these, and they work just like I had hoped. All of the Oculus apps and games run smoothly over wifi even in an apartment. However, make sure you buy the cord to connect to your pc for if you plan on playing SteamVR games. My experience is because I live around others (i.e., I live in an apartment) and I am running my pc on wifi with the Oculus on wifi at the same time; running both on wifi is unmanagable due to sever lag and locking up completely. However, pc on wifi with oculus on cable works just fine with moments of barely noticeable delay. Also, consider getting a more comfortable head strap with an extra battery pack if you plan on playing longer than 2 hours per session.

 Great experience, Beat Saber and Supernatural will close your circles fast. I just wish the headset had a longer battery life. I purchased the extended battery headstrap so that I can play longer. The other issue is I have 3 kids and you can only have 3 profiles on the headset so a second headset is needed for me and the wife. If you’re thinking about buy the Metaquest, think no further and just buy it. You won’t regret it!

I returned the item in pristine condition with all components and original packaging. I am shocked that even after their product made me physically ill, I have not received a full refund.

The headset itself is great. I have had no issues with anything except for the comfort. I immediately ordered a replacement strap for the headset as i cannot wear it for more than 20 minutes without getting a headache. The head strap is thin and has big hard pieces jabbing into your head. Oculus offers a replacement strap, but it is $50 MSRP and from what I have heard it isn’t even good quality, with multiple people reporting it breaking after little use. Overall, I recommend the headset, but it is (to me at least) necessary to have a head strap replacement ASAP.

I like it, yknow, it kinda sucks Facebook has a wall on it. But I rarely used my Facebook so It doesn't bother me that much. Keep in mind if you are going to use a link cable and you have a nice pc. Make sure you turn it up to 90hz on the oculus desktop app, it fixed ghosting for me and made it really smooth. Also I recommend buying a new headstrap, I didn't use the oculus one I got a KIWI brand head strap. I highly advise newcomers to the vr space to do research on this thing, it definitely  helps you understand it more. So a 4 just because the setup itself was annoying and the headstrap it comes with is pretty bad, and facebook. But a good value overall.

The only choice if you want to try out VR for the first time. The resolution is great, super easy to use, Air Link works fine, so you can play AAA titles like Half-Life Alyx, WIRELESSLY. The original strap is not that good though, I'd say it's pretty uncomfortable. People say playing with glasses is impossible, but in my case I didn't have any issues, the glass spacer does its job well (I'm still going to buy contact lenses, and highly recommend you doing the same, if you have really bad vision like I do). If you hate Facebook, there is Oculess, but I'm ok with it and don't care that much.For Russians and other europeans, buying an adapter from American type plug is VITAL, because you just wouldn't able to charge the headset.In conclusion, I think it's the best headset on the market so far, consider buying it, if you want to get into the VR world as a newcomer.

If you're shopping for a grandchild/niece/nephew who asked for a ""VR Headset,"" buy this one.Functionally, this headset is nearly perfect, especially for the price. The only problem with this headset is that it is owned by Facebook (now Meta), a company with some questionable ethics to say the least. As a VR enthusiast, I am not at all a fan of the walled garden Facebook is trying to build with their ""Quest ecosystem,"" especially since I mainly use this headset with a link cable and SteamVR.

For me I didn’t like the movement inside most games. It would become easily nauseating. I have the PSVR and have only had that issue with one of the games so far, other than that, the PSVR is superior to the Oculus 2 as far as smoothness being in the game. For a beginner headset you would be happy with the oculus for the money but if you’re looking for better immersive play with more game options, you’re looking at spending around a grand.

This product said that it would be shipped in a new condition but I can say with 100% confidence that it was not new. The box it came it said ""Oculus Quest 2"" which wasn't too surprising at first but then I realized that at the time of me buying the product that it should've said ""Meta Quest 2"" instead. Also when I opened the box one of the controllers had a smudge on the top of it. And after less than a month of me buying the product it just breaks, every time I turn it one the entire screen turns into whatever color the majority of the screen is making it almost impossible to play anything.

We have stupid and strange rules in Ukraine about packages. I don't know how it works but I had to pay 25% more for the Quest 2 for getting it (around $75). I was shocked because I have never paid that 25% before when I order import goods. I wanted to request a refund but Amazon decided to help me and they paid that 25% instead of me. I appreciate it. The Headset is awesome. Anyway you have to buy a good wifi 6 router for around $100 and some accessories like swords for Beat Saber, another strap, etc. So get ready to pay more than $300. Btw at first I wanted to play using Oculus Link but my AsRock z370 Extreme 4 motherboard doesn't have any type-c drivers lol. After that I decided to buy a wifi 6 router and I wasn't disappointed. Air Link has an awesome quality and low latency. Thank you Amazon for the Headset and help.

This is second breath after my PSVR. Very useful that it can be standalone and great to play with no wires. Will work something around two hours with no charge, which is pretty solid (considering my avg session time 1:30-2:00).Very recommended to buy a halo strap as helmet does not distribute weight on your head in the best way.The only thing I didn't like is that silicon mask cover is a bit bigger that it should be and there is folds  because of it. Anyway it doesn't bother me physically. Just need to place it correctly sometimes before wearing.

I'm a VR user since 2014 with the Oculus DK2, then I had an Oculus CV1, then an Oculus Rift S, and now a Quest 2. I tried the Quest 2 as standalone, then using AirLink, and lastly using a Cable.I think the Rift S is a better product, just works. If you are going to use the Quest 2 as a standalone is a great great product, but if you want to replace your PC VR, is not.For me, it's a 6.5/10 but if you are new, this could be a 9/10

Frustrating out of the box experience. It would try to boot up but crash and read No command with a little green man on his back with his chest open.  Software glitch on start up had me spending an hour online looking how to get this thing into a set up mode so I could factory rest it. I was 2 seconds away from returning it when it rebooted and actually powered on. I’ll update this if the user experience is extra special but so far I’m just frustrated with a mild headache. Now I wait for it to update..Following day, apart from the set up frustration and very slow updating the headset is something special.  Can’t wait to actually try out the apps and stuff but for now it’s working and kinda cool.

There are so many different things you can do on an Oculus. I love all the worlds you can explore and become fully submerged in. It’s even fun to use to browse apps like Instagram and YouTube. I gave it four stars because when I wear it for more than about five minutes, I start to get a headache, but I’m sure they’re working on making the next gen of Oculus lighter and more user-friendly.

Quest 2 is absolutely amazing! At $300, the 128gb version is a steal for the quality hardware, huge App Store & excellent performance. There’s really no need to buy the 256gb version or any of the accessories. Sure, the games cost extra but there are tons of free games available if you dig!Get off the couch & move around while you game! Several games easily trick you into working out without you even being aware of it… until you’re sweating & winded!No, it’s not the best but the current king of vr, the Valve Index, requires an extremely powerful gaming pc to plug into and is over $1200 just for the hardware. Quest 2 is nearly as good, has an App Store & is standalone (wireless.) Easy choice!

Upon unboxing this item, the screen didn’t work. You could only see about an inch of the display and the rest was complete static. Trying to troubleshoot, we finally were able to get to a screen where we could look around and found that it was logged in to another user’s Facebook account! I’m guessing this user returned the item because of the static issue, and Amazon turned around and resold it to me. I’m shipping this back but it will take close to 2 weeks to receive a replacement.

I would have rated this product a 5 star if it came with those head adjuster you can purchase separate. The elastic band that it comes with is super uncomfortable and whenever I’m playing a high intensity game like boxing, I get a blur vision as the headset eventually moves. I also wish it came some cool games for free and that it came with its case by default as it is quite an expensive product. Other than that really awesome experience.

Bought the Quest 2 for use in the cockpit of MS FlightSim 2020.  It works well for that for sure.  Lots of help on-line to get it setup to work well with the flight simulator.  I also tried several other apps in the Oculus Store and the SideQuest site.  I ultimately found the SuperNatural App to be a great motivator for me to exercise more.  The app promotes full body movement for great workouts  to a great collections of music.  SuperNatural  does require a monthly subscription, but it is much less than a monthly fitness club payment that I probably would only use a couple times a week.

With apps like Virtual Desktop and a good router and connecting to your PC, this easily becomes one of the best PC VR headsets, and the fact it also works stand alone is great. Due to this as well, it can be used wirelessly. Only down side is the not-so-great head strap. You can easily get yourself a 3rd party one that is way better (and cheaper) than the official pro head strap, but that quickly raises the price into the realm of other headsets that come with better head straps out of the box.Just make sure you have plenty of play space and be careful not to hit walls, or low ceilings!

This is my first VR headset, one of my brothers allowed me to try his Oculus headset in a family reunion, and I was blown away. Since that experience, I was sold, and I decided to get one of my own. I have to say, this Oculus quest is way better than TV. I use it whenever I get the chance.  The reason for the 4 stars is due to the battery life; it would be nice if the headset would have a longer battery life, I can roughly get around 2 and 3 hours of play. Other than that, I like it, and I am looking forward to play the games and eventually, use them with Second Life and Sansar VR.

The quest 2 is an amazing deal. Where most vr journeys begin with buying a beefy PC then getting a headset this allows you to begin and even end with a standalone headset that gets the job done just fine. If you’re even remotely interested in vr just buy it. Fair warning it’s not perfect, the graphics are great considering it’s running on essentially a suped up smart phone chip, but they’re still a bit limited. If you’re wanting insane graphics then I guess wait till you get a PC, but even then you can buy this now, enjoy it until you can get a decent PC and then just get a link cable.

The battery life is excellent and it's cool to break out when friends come over. The only con is after extended use of the Oculus you might experience dizziness /headache.

I purchased beatsaber and within seconds of loading any song it freezes and is unplayable. I have requested a refund but am told it may take days. Funny how that works, they take my money with no delay, but if I want that same money back 20 minutes later, they need all this time to process it. Considering returning the headset before the amazon return window is up as this is not promising.Another thing to note: If you have glasses, the experience can be rather uncomfortable and negatively affects picture quality.

This is great and has a realistic feeling. Awesome purchase to break up the monotony of working from home. It allows you to watch movies on Netflix and Amazon, browse the Internet, ride roller coasters, run with dinosaurs, and much more. I enjoy it as an adult and the kids and friends will get a kick out of it too. Controls were fairly easy to learn...I would say overall it takes about 2-3 hours of use to get used to the controls. There are a lot of free games and excercise apps to download and you can cast what your viewing or playing to your cell phone via WiFi!

Don't think about buying this headset. Just do it, like literally. Yeah it's a little expensive but it's well worth it. My children and I tried out a VR headset for the first time at my brother's house and we were in love. When my son asked for this for Christmas, I didn't think twice. It's easy to travel with and share the fun. From my youngest child of 7 all the way to my 60 year old step father, everyone has had an amazing time with this VR headset. Beatsaber is a must buy. The only complaint I've heard so far is that minecraft isn't VR yet. 😂

As far as the device itself, I give 5 stars it is great. But I purchased this because it advertised that it came with a $50 electronic credit versus one that came with a case. This was a gift for a teenager so I thought better to have a credit for games than the case.....after opening it, when I called to ask how to apply the credit, I was told that I was supposed to add some promo code at check out. That is not what was advertised.  There was no promo code to type in! I was asked if I took a screen shot of the offer. Didn't know I should have but do now! I was told there was absolutely nothing they could do. So for the experience,  I rate it 3 stars.

If you're going for a VR headset for pc play, get the HTC Vive; it's more expensive, but it is worth every penny compared to the Quest 2.Facebook(Meta) had the big brained idea of making the link cable port the same as the charging port. Normally this wouldn't be too bad, but the cable that is used is a usb c, a connector that can barely grab into the headset while in use.Functionality, it is far worse than previous oculus headsets (poor controller tracking, front sensors, ect) The only upside to the Quest 2 over say the Rift S, is it's weight; it is far lighter than other headsets. But that is a foot note compared to my problems with the Quest 2

The product itself is awesome, no complaints. It's insanely fun and you will love it. The problem was that I purchased it under the pretense that I would get a $50 Amazon credit upon purchase which has not been the case.  Upon research, it appears that many of us are having this problem and right now especially $50 is a huge deal and could benefit a lot of people to have that at their disposal.  Very disappointed in this aspect of my purchase and had I known I wouldn't have gotten the credit, I might have opted on a different purchase or looked to buy from a different retailer.  C'mon man that's just not right to do to people.

HAHAHA it’s been another 16 DAYS since they’ve told me they will send a new headset and I should get the shipping tracking number “shortly” what a scam. Feels like they “stole” my headset.

Great for wireless PCVR as well as the standalone games from oculus. 2 weeks later the right controller started to drift, have to use contact cleaner to fix it. Air link works great, though i had to get a new wifi router (MUST be wifi 6, with high bandwidth). Link cable does look sharper though but the cable is annoying and for most games the wireless is better. It has decent resolution that is very clear (no grid/screen effect). Battery lasts for about 2 hours, with a powerbank attached It goes for way more, ~ 6 hours.Been playing both native and PCVR games and loving it, just the controller drift was annoying

Get a PC based system if you want to play immersive realistic games.Quest2 does not deliver what VR should; the graphics of the games,( I played Resident Evil, Sniper Elite and medal of honor)  remind me of the computer games of 20 years ago.

If you had the quest 1 when it came out, like me, you would know it came with a long charger and a nice case that could fit the headset with a external back strap. This one comes with a short charger that you can’t play with and a not high quality case. The new headset also comes with a Velcro’s strap fully unlike the plastic quest 1 strap. This forces you to buy the pro head strap. A case that can fit everything, and a longer connect charger. They are doing this just trying to get more money I feel

Delivery in Russia was for 8 days and it was faster, than we thought.Don't forget buy adapter for plug, if you haven't american socket and wire for connet with computer for best expirience and for work with another shops (like steam).Oculus have good picture and high quality of sound for it price.Included all, what you need and have good and comfortable box for storage.You can start play in game on computer with GTX1050ti 4GB (ONLY WITH ti!).

I was hesitant to purchase an oculus wondering if it would get used enough. Games like Beat Saber provide a better cardio workout than walking, and I enjoy the competitiveness of ping-pong. The only downside is that it should come with a better head strap, but they are not too expensive to replace.

The headset is very well done. The hardware is very well done, the item is well priced. I have not tried the headset without the Oculus Link cable yet, most of my hours are with a PC. I am giving it a 4 star though because it does require a Facebook account link, otherwise the headset is completely useless.

I wasn’t truly aware of how cool of a device I was purchasing. Trying to find a cool gift for my Grandsons birthday. Saw this a purchased & a carrying case. The only reason I couldn’t give it a five star, it would fall off durning use. It was a little heavy and uncomfortable. Once I purchased a better head attachment new foam for the face the extra devices added comfort and stability. With oculus quest 2, protection plan and all devices total price coming to $500. My grandson is now happy he can actually play with his birthdays gift.I recommend the Oculus Quest 2 just purchase all devices at time of purchase.

Headset is lightweight, easy to use and has a great cordless feature. However you can only purchase games through the oculus store. I dont know if anyone else is having this issue but the Oculus store is broken! It will not allow you to add any form of payment so you can have games to use. Also it still requires you to add a Facebook account to use it! In essence it’s a very nice paperweight and there is NO tech support!

Great headset. I do wish the graphics were just a little sharper (closer to PCVR) but it's no biggie. Only thing I recommend before buying is to have someone to play online with. Solo play/usage is cool but can get boring after a while. It's best as a social device.

This product has no parental controls whatsoever.  Within 5 minutes of setting it up, I heard strangers talking in my living room.  Went to see who was talking and it was random people talking to my teenage son through this headset.  Also do not like the fact that it still requires Facebook account to use the headset.  Bought it under the impression they were doing away with that requirement.

Been gaming most of my life. Been considering an Oculus for quite some time, to pursue my developer hobby at 41 years of age.All I can say is that it's an awesome piece of entertainment tech to have around. Coming from normal screen gaming it takes some getting used to, but, its definitely very cool. Even my girlfriend thinks so, and she's usually not very much into techy things.Minor improvements which will help make it better is improved battery life, and a way to organise all your content in some way so it's easier to navigate the interface and find your favorite stuff.

I got my oculus on August 25, 2021 and it hasn't even been a year. I've never in my life seen anything like this. It wasn't even on the charger for a long period of time and the oculus was completely melted. I need a replacement cause obviously this is not normal. I've been using this particular charger for over 3 years on my phone and I've charged my phone all night. My oculus might have short circuited or something because this can't be normal. I am super disappointed. 300$ spent on something that hasn't even lasted a year.

I bought these to watch 360 travel/tour videos, but the quality of the player was no where near what I expected. The image quality was like watching it on an old analog TV - definitely not HD.I didn't try any games or watching Netflix.My expectation was that the quality would at least be in the same ballpark as watching them on my flat screen - perhaps a little lower quality.

Save your money and get a Valve index. This headset is just a cheap money grab by Facebook. As someone whos had VR for a few years now, this headset seems about 4 years behind.Low FOV, low refresh rate, blurry at best resolution, barely able to play most modern titles unless you get a link cable.You can also get an Oculus Rift if you really want to stay in the predatory Facebook ecosystem

The movies and videos are fun, especially ""adult"" videos.The goggles are a bit heavy and can cause some issues with eye strain until you get used to it.

It can basically play all the games the pc vr's can will being completely portable. With air link or a link cable it can be connected to a pc to play pc only games. I would also recommend buying an elite strap with it as well as the original strap does tend to hurt a bit after a few hours of game time. It can be a third market one like kiwi's.

So on Amazon’s part it was very good. Arrived in 3 days. Awesome, but on Oculus’ part is.....pretty bad. Headset is really cool I’m able to get free games. But when it comes to the app and putting in my payment method to buy games it just won’t allow me. And I’m not the only one, hundreds of people are having the same issue with contacting and getting support from oculus. It’s a gamble with this thing in my perspective, risk not being able to put a payment option on the device to buy games or just simply have a good working VR to play games on. It’s very frustrating that I payed $300 for this and can’t even play good games on it.

Delivery: It was a terribly long delivery to Vladivostok (Russia). From America quickly sent to Moscow, but in Moscow the parcel was in stock for a week. Delivers by UPS goods terribly, asks the same info twice, and responds for a long time.Helmet: The mount (where the speakers)  is for some reason a bit dirty, although the product is new. Hand tracking looks good, the helmet is fast, the picture quality in games is terrible, because even such a good processor does not pull the picture well in good quality without lags, but it's still cool. The controllers are very convenient. I hope VR will continue to develop, so far this technology is quite raw, but already fun.

Literally this satisfied my itch of sword art online, I wanted to be in a game and this delivers, sometimes I lose sense of my surroundings and I'll end up hitting my ceiling fan or my tv, I recommend placing a rug or something under your feet so you dont go to far off to the sides and you stay centered. Youd think it would break the emerson but it dosnt, your brain will subconsciously recognize how far you can go without it affecting the game play at all. Good exercise to

As a streamer and gamer, my son spends a lot of time gaming and chatting back and forth with his friends. However, I would on occasion knock on his door to see if he was awake, alive(teenager on a game). Once, I gave his the Occulas 2 for Christmas, now it's a ""NONSTOP PARTY!"" It's no longer quick chats, but entire conversations, music, laughing. And he is up and moving and really stimulating his body in exercise with boxing, watching movies with friends....THE BEST MONEY SPENT! I'm getting one next.

I got the quest 2 about two months ago and it was not a bad move at all. Not only if it super immersive since it's cable free. It's also an amazing conversation starter. Not many people have gotten to try VR still, and the quest 2 is in my opinion the best device to be introduced on. I will say however, you should not get the quest if you're looking for something to replace an old console, as being an all in one system,As the battery life isn't the greatest. If your looking for an addition to your gaming collection, the quest 2 is where its at!

But the VR made me fall down. Gamed say sitting but you may have to stand to see the entire play area. Then the character moves while you don't. My head spun. Games with teleport like  resident evil didn't cause this issue. VR is fun but my game choice is limited. My wife was worse than me with the motion issue.

The item description fails to mention YOU have to have a Facebook account to use this. It FAILS to mention you have to be 13 years or older to use it because you have to be at least 13 to have Facebook. And was warning about its size not designed for younger players. It is NOT easy to set up because we are stuck on the having no Facebook account. And Facebook is not good on privacy. They sell your info to much. I wish the item warned us we HAD to have FAcebook before it was bought. Seems like false advertising. They are forcing us to get unwanted Facebook after already paying $300.

Received a headset that was previously used and had someone else logged in. Had to figure out how to do the factory reset on the headset since it wouldn’t connect to the app. After the reset it works fine. Thinking I should’ve just returned it for an actual new one since now I’m worried about how long it was used and the battery life. But it seems okay.

It may not be the most high end VR HMD out there, but for the price it's definitely the most versatile. It can play all Quest and Oculus games, SteamVR, VIVE Port, etc. Plus, you can play any Quest game wirelessly, and any PCVR game wirelessly with the correct hardware.

We have had nothing but problem with this headset. At first it started glitching so I did a factory reset. Then, it didn’t have any of my sons apps appear as purchased and any time he tried to go anywhere it went back to his Home Screen so I did another factory reset which worked for two days. Now the headset is glitching again and stays on loading anytime he tries to enter an app. I attempted to call customer  support, was on hold for 10Minutes then rerouted to a voicemail. Very unhappy right now.

Amazing product. Well made. Haven't had any issues with it. Great technology in such a small and wireless package. The oculus link feature alone makes it worth every penny. Streaming high fidelity PC exclusive VR games straight to my headset with virtually no latency is incredible. Hats off to the oculus team.  Love it. If you're going to buy one though just make sure you also get at least a 10-16ft usb C charge cable for long plug as you play sessions, and a different premium head strap for better comfort. And for glasses wearers like myself prescription VR lens from somewhere like VR Wave are the best investment, trust me.

A lot of cool things about it: PC compatible,  optionally wireless, motion tracking anywhere without setting additional hardware.This pricetag is literally a license to steal, best thing on the market, especially if you are new.One thing to note that to use PC VR, 5Ghz or WiFi6 router or Link cable (which is sold separately) is necessary, another - avoid direct sunlight from going through the lenses, this might and actually will permanently damage your screen.This brought me new experience in gaming which I didn't have for maybe last 10 years, watch out for your pets and furniture, stay safe and enjoy.

The oculus is an incredible piece of tech. My only issue is how expensive the games are. I completely understand that the game companies need to make money, but there’s a certain level where we should be able to buy the device with one pre installed game, like BeatSaber or Galaxy’s Edge, or whatever, so the Oculus isn’t basically useless until you can buy a game. The games also average from 15-40 dollars, some with add ons even after the initial 40$ price point. My only problem with the Oculus is the game costs.

I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to play VR games from computer, but with airlink I can play them easily, I am playing Boneworks right now and I recommend it. Only problem I have is if someone is using the wifi, then airlink starts to lag, so I usually play it only when I am alone at home. Also while using Airlink, you need to use lan cable on your computer, also you need to be close to your router for a good experience. It also has it's own app store and games too and they don't require any other device like a computer, you can just start your VR headset and play/use them.

It's really a pain for people that require glasses to see clearly to put on the headset. You will have to put your glasses inside the headset first, and then put on the headset on your head with your glasses together.Also, I only used the headset for a month, and there is already some scratch on the lenses, most likely caused by the glasses frame. Thankfully it doesn't affect my vision in VR at the moment, but I have to order a Quest 2 lenses protector on Amazon to prevent further damage to the lenses.

Loved the product for its immersive capabilities and image quality, but ultimately had to return due to the severe nausea I experienced every time I used it. I realize I may be a rare case, but important consideration for a $300+ device. Hoped it would get better, but after two weeks of trying to “build a tolerance”, I had to make the decision to send it back.

In all seriousness, love the VR headset. Easy to use, set up, get app running, even my 3 y/o likes to play with it. There is a limited number of free games or apps, and that’s why I say bye bye money! Once you get hooked it will be charge after charge but it’s worth it!

Great product really was happy at first. But the blurriness of the lens is causing me to strain my eyes and give me headaches.  I have a history of headaches and every single time I use it I get an immediate headache.  Unfortunately going to have to return it. If you get headaches stay away this will definitely trigger them and intensify them.

Really like this so far! Lots of good apps and experiences.Package doesn't come with headphones (doubt I can use my wireless ones without lagging sound). Stock strap is eh. The silicone/rubber interface has wrinkles in it and let's a huge amount of light through around the nose. So ordered a different silicone interface. Also doesn't come with lens covers for when not being used.

I love the quest 2 and the games that are supported  but it can be better. 1 the battery life is horrible only giving you about 30 minutes of playtime before you have to charge it. 2 if you want to buy a game you need to put in your quest pin and they only show you it once and it's through the quest app so if you forget your pin you have to make a new one. 3 if you leave the quest plugged in for a long period of time the charging port will melt. Do I recommend the quest 2? yes just make sure you have a way around all the problems listed.

Resident Evil 4 VR alone makes this thing a MUST buy! I bought one and let my friends try it and now they all want one too. My one gripe is the battery life is almost atrocious, it almost takes longer to charge the thing than playing it on a full battery and it blows but it's understandable and it has a long charger you can buy for it. Overall Playing RE4 and experiencing YouTube in like a theatre setting and playing VRChat with friends has been a blast and I'm glad I bought it, great present for a kid or dad!

Because it’s portable, supports Microphone and Audio, and works just like a computer.The games however are extremely pricey in my book and the battery doesn’t last a very long time.I would hope in the future that oculus would have a special subscription like Xbox gold.

Resolution is really bad. All your games will be blurry. I have good hardware, I played HL:Alyx via official cabel - it is bad. Also the most bad thing - the connection to the Oculus servers is always required and it is not stable.  Why do I need connection to Oculus servers for games in my SteamVR, this is really stupid idea. If connection is not stable - your game starts glitching.

Purchased the Quest 2 and it took a little over a week to be delivered which was fantastic. The device itself is better very easy to setup and once setup is done its a breeze to use. I have had the Oculus go before this and the screen door effect has been fixed. The ability to connect to pc and play steam games is awesome. the only downside to the quest 2 is the battery life with a little over 1.5 hours of normal gameplay (not connected to the pc) could be improved.

I ordered the quest 2 thinking that I could use the $50 credit for purchasing it on accessories like grips and vr covers but they don’t tell you that it’s only for items sold and shipped by Amazon.

The point is the quest 2 is great but don’t get your hopes high about using that credit to further upgrade your device cause you won’t find anything useful from amazon

You need a Facebook (Meta) account to use the oculus. VR is the future. There aren’t many games at this point. However, I suspect that the next few years will bring hundreds of new titles. The graphics are not photorealistic. As the technology develops the games will become I distinguishable from reality. Purchase the oculus 2 now because Facebook is offsetting the actual cost of the technology to get these into as many homes as possible. You will not be disappointed.

If you are looking for a cheaper jump into VR the quest is a perfect option. Especially if you use a pc link. But even without that the headset works wonderfully. But be warned, the strap is uncomfortable and the face cushion isn’t the most pleasant. I highly recommend upgrading both just to make wearability better. Also be aware with how the controllers are shaped, you will bonk yourself or other things sometimes. The rings placement just makes that happen.

While the oculus in itself was nice, it requires you to link to a Facebook account. My Facebook account was hacked about a month after I purchased this equipment and since Facebook has zero customer service, I can't get back into that account. This means the oculus is now an expensive piece of useless junk. The oculus customer service tried to help but, apparently, once a Facebook account is linked to the oculus, they can't close it and help you set it up under another account.

Plus u gotta buy all the games on top of the $300 u just paid for the oculus.  It’s pretty cool though I’ll it give that!

This is a very good step toward what it should be. However the quality of the image drops a lot during the process and it is especially very bad for real-life videos. The band doesn't allow for long usage because it leaves tracks on your face.

Great product, works. Setting up sucks especially with wifi you have to login with. And sideloading updates isn't working like all the videos tell you to. So I can't update it either way.

Great product - but delivery was a nightmare.  I ordered from Bulgaria and prepaid the import charge- However, I was then charged another 12 Euros import costs to release it from the Bulgarian import dept. It took 3 days to arrive from America, then took another 2 weeks to arrive at my house.  Granted the customer service was excellent - I even felt sorry for them.  The Bulgarian DHL service is inept.  However, the Oculus is AMAZING and I love it

As someone who has never tried virtual reality, the quest has opened my eyes to some really fun times. I recommend getting a link cable if you plan on doing PCVR, you’ll need some extremely low latency if you don’t have one. One issue I have is the pressure the standard strap puts on my head. I have to adjust the strap periodically when I play on it because it hurts after a good bit. Otherwise, amazing device!

I would have to buy a lens accessory with my prescription to use properly.I have long hair and felt like this product would just slide of my head. Imagine breaking a $300 item because it just slips off

To be honest, I was hyped all year about the Quest 2 and all the promises and features of the Metaverse, it seems something up my alley.When I got it, something felt really off. The Quest 2 squeezed my glasses, but the old ones fit? It was odd, and I hope the Metaverse team addresses this in future installments, this was a let down. This small issue is for spec wearing people like me isn't spoken much around the VR community, and getting into VR is super expensive.

After about a month it started getting in a boot loop were it just turns on, the screen stays black and then it turns off. I've factory reset it, turned it off for hours, let it battery die and it still has this problem. Tech support isn't helpful. Will be sending back for a refund or will probably just get rid of it.

As expected for a VR headset.  Lots of fun. Games can be costly - at least those worth playing. Was surprised to learn, after purchase, that the headset is only recommended for those age 13 and up - due to neurological development. You may want to research if purchasing for a child.

I enjoy the table tennis, Saber, and bowling programs. I've watched a few movies and the quality is very good. I wish I could figure out a way to upload my iTunes music to use with some of the games, like bowling, I'll keep trying. I think it's well worth the cost even with having to pay high shipping costs to Thailand, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting a counterfeit unit so I was willing to pay the extra cost. I just wish I wouldn't have waited so long to buy.

I love the price, controller tracking, and features. The games are good and the screens are great and as someone once put it, “The Quest 2 is the Nintendo switch of VR” it can do about anything, just don’t expect photorealistic graphics. My only dislike is that it is made by Facebook, but at least since it is so you can buy it for less than the hardware is worth! For my first VR headset, I’d say it’s a great introduction.

I just googled how to do a manual factory reset, so I'll update this review if the Quest 2 is defective... Batteries were in the controllers already, and all the actual Oculus paperwork was just tossed in the box. FFS.

Shooters or any games where you're constantly moving your head around cause this headset to misalign or even fall off your head if trying to crouch down to pick something up.The Headstrap is far more comfortable than the standard strap and the battery is great for the price, but the amount of times I need to adjust the headstrap in a single session grows very tiresome.

I am a VR content developer. During the work I tried a dozen models of VR headsets. At the beginning of 2022, this is the best VR headset in terms of quality and price. The only drawback of Oculus Quest 2 is the inconvenient fastening and adjustment of the straps. I recommend additionally buying the Elite Strap for Quest 2 or an analog.Delivery to Russia is a little more than 2 weeks (December-January). Thanks to Amazon.

There are glitches with the guardian boundary regardless of whether it’s stationary or room - it seems to lose tracking frequently and no amount of cleaning the cameras or rebooting it will help.

I got my Oculus Quest 2 and enjoy it. It is cool to play a game or watch a VR video and feel like you are inside the game or video instead of watching it on a screen. I wear glasses so the glasses spacer comes in handy. I highly recommend the Oculus if you want to experience virtual reality.

the quest 2 is a great product, but the issue is that the highest IPD for the machine is 68mm, while is less than mine. There will be comments online about you can use it if your ipd is higher than 70, but based on my experience it will just cause too much eye strain and there is a small blurry all the time which is annoying.Plan to return it.

The system is great and I expect that I will enjoy it a lot. However, people need to be aware that it'snot an all-inclusive system. Just like a PS system or a Nintendo system, you have to buy the software that makes it go by either purchasing or signing up for a subscription. The system is expensive enough. SOMETHING should be with it other than a couple demo versions.

It's a great piece of hardware everybody already knows this. They also know this part but I need to comment on it.  The tightening mechanism at the back of the strap consists of two plastic pieces to tighten and loosen, those plastic pieces start to dig into the back of your head after a few minutes of playing and I find myself trying to readjust it to fix it but I doesn't help.

I personally don’t care for this VR headset, I had an old oculus Rift, had no problem with it and it never gave me a headache, while as to this one, gives me a headache, it’s pointless, and the games are overpriced, so if your someone willing to spend hundreds of dollars on something that isn’t even good then be my guest but I don’t recommend this product.

I had a great deal of fun with the quest 2 for the first 2 weeks I had it.

The battery life lasts surprisingly long for what all it is running, and you can play while it charges (just as long as you have a long enough cord). 10/10 would purchase again

My 6 year old used the headset for one evening and has a rash from her jaw line to eyebrows. She had fun on it and is very upset I won't let back on the next day. Not sure if she will be able to use it at all again.

The Oculus Quest 2 is next level VR when it comes to wireless VR gaming. The native Oculus games also do very well.Downside to the Quest 2 is that the standard strap is very uncomfortable when playing for a long period, buy an Elite Strap or use a counterweight to make it more comfortable.I would highly recommend the Oculus Quest 2.

Wonderful product! It is like going to a different world.Must have for all tech/gaming/gadgets savvies .at least to experience it.I did not connect it to a powerful PC yet so can't advise on the PCVR but from what I've tried from the standalone headset - it is amazing.Can't wait to see what the future of VR will become.

I love this VR headset, you don't need a PC in order to use it. You only need the headset. As long as you keep it charged, you can get a couple hours of fun out of it, but I do recommend that you keep the charger near you because the battery does tend to drain pretty quick.

Pretty freaking cool. The only problem is if you have a tendency towards motion sickness/vertigo this thing can really screw you up. That's what it did to me. I would like to use it more but I got to get over the sickness.

* Oculus had stopped selling the Quest 2 temporarily, because of an issue with the foam piece that touches your face, which had caused skin irritation for some users.  That part now has a silicon cover, which should prevent the facial irritation issues, and now the new Quest 2 has 128GB (or 256GB) storage, up from 64GB in the original Quest 2. *The Quest 2 seems to be the best deal in VR headsets at the moment.  The previous release of Quest 2 was $399 and only had 64GB, and even then it was probably the best deal at the time.Keep in mind, you still need a Facebook account to use this VR headset; but at this price, it is worth it to just make a Facebook account.  This VR headset can be used connected to your gaming PC, or just used stand alone.We now have a 64GB version and a 128GB version, and we never actually ran out of space on the 64GB.  The kids mostly play BeatSaber and Vader Immortal, while the adults favorite game so far is probably Trover Saves the Universe (not for younger kids) .If you are thinking about getting into VR, try the Quest2 out.  It is easy enough to learn, you don't need that much space, and you can be up and running right away.  Our kids like it much more than regular consoles, and at least you get a small amount of physical activity!

Oculus, a.k.a. Facebook, lies and manipulates consumers. Tons of the features they advertise will not be available to you if you buy one of their devices. Think you’re getting a 120 Hz display? You’re not, and if you think you should be based on their advertising and patch notes, they will hide behind their labeling of such important features as merely “experimental.”On top of that, they’ve demonstrated their intent to put ads in *paid* games. There was a backlash against the first attempt, so the developer of the game backed down. But, it’s just a matter of time - they’re simply waiting for peoples’ attentions to wane and tolerance to set in. It’s Facebook, so you know games are going to be absolutely clogged with ads as soon as they feel they can get away with it.Oh, also, the face covering could mess up your face. Mine caused me to break out in a rash. When I contacted them about this, they just said “nope, sorry, it’s not a problem,” only to be forced to admit that it *had been* a problem a few months later when they issued a recall. Shady.In short, save your money and buy from an honest, reputable company before buying into Facebook’s predatory ecosystem

The oculus quest 2 is easily the best VR system for the money due to its ease of use and wireless play abilities. It can also be used as a PC VR if one has a high end gaming PC. If this is the case storage also doesn’t matter due to the fact that the games are stored on the PC. It has a large variety of games that are playable without a PC. I highly recommend it.

I purchased an Oculus and used it for 1 day before the controller broke.  Unable to get any replacement parts for 2 months now so I cannot use it any longer, they are not in stock and the support team is supposed to send one but has not.  The unit was fun while it lasted, but I am unhappy that it is no longer working after 1 day, if it was made a little better it would not have broke.  It did give me extreme motion sickness when playing games that allow you to move without actually walking.

No Replacement Parts for My Broken Oculus

This is a review of the Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 128 GB.I have never used a virtual reality device before and was super eager to try it out. I have heard good things about the Oculus Quest 2 so I was really happy to get one. Happy to say it’s pretty amazing.First of all about me, I am older and although I’m fairly techie, I have never tried VR before. So as soon as I opened the box I was a little intimidated because frankly the instruction pamphlet is not all that great for a novice and the start-up foldout only gets you connected. Following the foldout was easy - now to go on and see what this puppy can do.I immediately went to the Internet and looked up various videos because at least for me, it wasn’t all that intuitive and I was having some trouble figuring out how to use the controls and access the apps and programs I wanted. Once I saw the videos, it was easy.So how do I like it? I have to say it’s pretty amazing. The headset feels okay/comfortable and you can adjust the  lens for clarity - not perfect but fine and doable. It’s easy to set up with one problem I had at the start - the tab to pull out of one of the hand controls ripped which was an issue and we had to struggle to get it out.  Without removing those tabs you cannot operate or connect the Oculus Quest 2. Again, be sure to check out settings and the various options and  check out some of the available fan videos.The only concern I have - and no stars off for this because it’s not the fault of the Oculus Quest 2 - is that it really gave me motion sickness after just 10 minutes and I felt dizzy. I have tried it out several times to no avail - I am prone to migraines and sadly, I won’t be able to use this. I have some issues even watching movies in 3D so this did not come as a great surprise to me. My husband had the same problems I did while using it, although he too was amazed by the graphics and clarity. I did give it to my son who is in 7th heaven so it all worked out great.Lastly - you have to have a Facebook account to use this which was an issue for me because I had closed out my FB account because I didn’t want it. So to use this, I opened another one under my husband’s name with full privacy mode and no other information than his name. That’s one way to get around this I guess but do know you need that FB account.

I like the VR headset. It’s very fun. The problem is that you can only play for a short period of time. I charged it for about 2 hours and 50 minutes then it was on full charge. I played on it for about 1 hour, then it died. Otherwise the oculus is very fun to play with. I really like watching television and playing “VRChat” and “Blade & Sorcery” with my friends.

I purchased my oculus 2 from amazon in January 2021, ever since I got it I've had problems with the headset requiring multiple (10-15) hard resets to get it to work. When I turn it on, I get the oculus symbol and a buzz on the controllers but then just complete blackness. Oculus support has told me to restart the headset but this never prevents or solves the issue. Recently my Elite strap just cracked on its own. I've never dropped it and I always keep it in my hard case when not in use. Apparently, this was/is a known major problem but it is not being addressed on their website... but the headset that causes rashes is being recalled... Don't buy one of these until Oculus/Facebook figures out these issues. Also, this should be a verified purchase, but for some reason when I click to leave a review from my order page, I get a ""This page is missing"" message. Some shady shade going on here.

I think that most everyone reading the reviews will already be aware that (for some ABSURD reason) a facebook account is now REQUIRED in order to use hardware. Although this is very unfortunate, especially considering that the founder of Oculus promised that we would never need a Facebook account in order to use the product, it is forgivable I guess.What is not forgivable is that if you have lost access to your old Facebook account (that you never use anymore) then this might brick your Oculus. Not having access to my old Facebook account, I thought, ""Oh well, I'll just create a new Facebook account so that I can use my new Oculus."" NOPE! Facebook instantly locked the new account I created and gave no options to fix the problem. I contacted Oculus customer service and they claimed that I had to contact Facebook directly and that the Oculus team could not help. (They said that Facebook will probably get back to me in 5-7 business days.)After trying to 4 different ways to contact Facebook to get my account unlocked, I was unable to contact anyone. When your account is locked, you simply see a screen that says ""Help us confirm your identity"" with a ""continue"" button that is grayed out so you cannot continue. I tried logging out of Facebook to contact them about this issue, but when you try to submit a support ticket, guess what, you need to log in in order to do so! Great! Facebook sticks you in an infinite loop of not being able to solve your problem. I tried submitting a general ticket two weeks ago, but never received a response or any indication that they even received my support request. Now I have a $300 paperweight sitting on my desk that I cannot use. I tried contacting Oculus support once again and their best suggestion was for me to return the Oculus back to the retailer at which I bought it. Great customer service! I think I will take their advice.I remember when Oculus was so cool and inspiring. I really, REALLY tried to give the new version a chance (despite hating Facebook and wanting to avoid it at all costs). But when you brick the $300 hardware I just bought and make ZERO attempts to remedy the issue through two different customer service brand teams, I am officially done. I will never spend another penny on a Facebook/Meta/Zuckerberg Meat Smokers product ever again. I can't wait for Apple to release their VR and put Oculus out of business.Beware friends!

BUYER BEWARE - FACEBOOK WILL BRICK YOUR HARDWARE

This is my very first virtual reality (vr) headset or even trying vr. I am blown away at how far we have come in technology. I must say that this device is bringing out the geek in me. However, there are a few things that needs to be addressed. First, as everyone has mentioned that if you want to use this with comfort at all you must buy a new strap immediately. The strap that comes with the headset is useless, it's uncomfortable, leaves you with impressions on the forehead, pressure on forehead, hard to adjust, snags your hair, and constantly slips down. I have no understanding as to why they decided to put such a disastrous strap on this device. It's like let's buy a Tesla without the ability for the car to drive itself.. that's one of the main reasons people buy a Tesla!! I had to go and buy a elite strap but no I did not buy the occulus elite strap because it also seems to have its shortcomings based on other reviews. Come on FB get with the program and stop trying to undercut quality. The other thing is the battery life of the headset.. 2 hours is just not enough. Sure I could use a power bank which I have the ability to do but again the point of the matter is you shouldn't have to. Back when I played regular gaming consoles I could play for a good 6 hours depending on the game...(this is just to prove a point) Increase the battery life on the device to at least 5 hours and then we're talking. I was in the middle of a game and it was just getting good and bam shut down, battery died. Who really wants to have a vr headset on their head, earplugs, and a power bank all attached to play a decent game time. Also the lighting in your room plays a factor in your ability to use the headset.. What!! I don't always like to keep my lights on during gaming and even moreover if I'm looking in the headset it shouldn't matter. So here is my opinion on that.. put a light on the headset so it will see in the dark for your barrier or provide some type of neon glow in the dark strips that you can place around your barrier and the headset will be able to pick up the uv without extra lighting because again it's wasteful to just have a light on so your device can see if you personally don't need the light. Also, add a game to download for free since we are given such a crap poor headstrap to begin with. Buy a 300 dollar headset just to have to buy 6+other accessories to make it comfortable and usable is not a good deal. I personally bought several additional items such as the elite headstrap (not from occulus), a link cable, a storage case, controller grips, rechargeable batteries, ear bud holders, noise canceling ear buds, anti-glare lenses, and a power bank strap. Honestly, the only thing I appreciated was the included glasses spacer insert. Therefore, I spent upwards of $600 to make your headset worth it to play including 2 cheap game downloads. This headset needs to be cheaper or add some higher quality accessories to it to even out the cost of what you will need to buy to make this worthwhile, comfortable, and enjoyable. For all this, I could have just bought another console and it wouldn't have been so cumbersome because really all I would have needed is the console and a game or 2...done no other accessories required.

I have tried various VR headsets, from those you have a mobile phone attached to a headset, another is the Oculus Go, which I have had the opportunity to do research for the mental health industry and also train those in the industry on the use and potential of the technology.But today I am testing the recently released 128GB version of the Oculus Quest 2, which was released by Oculus, a brand owned by Facebook.The virtual reality headset was released on October 13, 2020 as a 64GB model priced at $299 and a 128GB model for $399. On August 2021, the 128GB model dropped to $299 and the 256GB model was released for $399.The latest version featured a similar design to the original Quest while lighter in weight, updated specifications, a higher refresh rate and resolution and updated Oculus Touch controllers.So, I wanted to see for myself of how I felt about the technology and its improvements since 2019.The headset comes with a head strap, the two Oculus touch controllers each with a AA battery and a USB-C power adapter.After charging the unit, I went ahead and set my headset to my wireless connection and connected it to my Facebook account.It's important for everyone to know that it is mandatory that you MUST have a Facebook account for this device. The account is profile-based, and you can not set multiple profiles. So, those used to a console such as a PlayStation, XBOX or Nintendo Switch who are used to having multiple profiles, this is not possible. If you have several children, they can either play under your account profile or you will need to purchase each person their own headset.And then can setup your virtual environment from the currently eight offered and then get acquainted with software like First Step (which is an entertaining introduction to the how VR is with the unit and will impress those who never used VR before).You can setup your ""Guardian"" which you can see your space and making a ring around you, to let the unit know how much space you have for gaming, so you don't hit the wall or any thing that you have in your room.But then it's time to check out the apps available.  Most will want to try the free apps offered.  But then I was ready to purchase and test out games from numerous genres.The first game I decided to test out was one game that many people have put high in their ""must-buys"".So, after doing research, I wanted to test out the system completely in the following genres.   For rhythm and dance games: ""Beat Saber"", ""Audio Trip"" and ""Synth Riders"".  And two games from Japan, such as ""Kizuna Ai - Touch the Beat!"" and ""Beat Arena"".For shooter, I decided to try ""Population One"", ""Pistol Whip"", ""Blaston"" and ""Larcenauts"".  For sports, ""Golf 5 eClub"", ""Top Golf with Pro Putt"" and ""ForeVR Bowling"".  For fighting, ""Thrill of the Fight!"", ""Ironlights: Ultimate Update"" and ""Holopoint"".  For adventure, the three episodes of ""Star Wars: Vader Immortal"". For social, I tried VRchat, vTime and AltspaceVR.With the rhythm games, each of the three games provided an entertaining and fun workout.  Featuring cool music and most importantly, companies releasing inexpensive DLC music packs is a plus.    Each have a similarity in choosing skill factor and ability to select different music and go at your own pace.  Have only ten minutes to work out, then dance to three songs.But what I like is the workout aspect.  You are going to dance as you crouch or move to the left and right to avoid barriers.  And the better you get, you can set your skill higher for an even more intense workout.For the two Japanese games, ""Kizuna Ai - Touch the Beat"" is no doubt for the anime fans who want an easier pace and the fact that the makers put on live events (announced on Twitter on FB) to coincide with their device is a plus.  While ""Beat Saber"" allows you to play drums, guitar and bass and strumming or hitting the drum to the beat/symbol.  But I see the potential, for the Japanese market to really capitalize on the growth of VR as many established, may it be anime,RPG or sports games from Japan can be suitable for VR.The golfing on the Oculus Quest 2 is absolutely awesome.  I was surprised of how my swing was actually emulated quite well on the Oculus Quest 2, from driving to putting.  And the fact that you have golf enthusiasts playing and competing is a plus.  While I tested ""Thrill of the Fight!"" and the boxing mechanics were quite awesome.  Again, the workout involved in quick punches, jabs, etc. and the training in the gym, makes for another wonderful reason to get a VR headset.But games such as ""Holopoint"" is one of those games where you will need adequate space.  When purchasing a game on Oculus, you will receive a warning that the game is meant to be played in a larger setting.  Of course, a few people may guesstimate that they have adequate room and may have 5.5 feet when they game asks for 6.5 feet from all sides.  So, please do your due diligence in researching the game and how much space you need.For shooting, this is where I could only do ten minute sessions.  You have to shoot, move, crouch and prepare for intense combat that you are often in motion. If first-person shooters on a console doesn't give you motion sickness (as I play a lot), a shooter on VR is a different story.  You have to think quick, move quick and while ""Pistol Whip"" and ""Blaston"" was easier, I realized that shooting games that require a lot of movement will take awhile for me to get used to.  I tried to do an hour of ""Population One"" and I was nauseous right after and even the morning after.But the first game that made me love gaming on the Oculus Quest 2 was ""Star Wars: Vader Immortal"".  I love how the game was immersive and the first moment when you come into contact with the Empire, what a memorable VR experience.And last but not least, the chats available.  I think that as I partake in the various VR chats, many have adopted life for a few hours in the VR world to be exciting, especially during these times.  The people you meet all around the world and conversations are quite enjoyable most of the time (and yes, like real life, you can see drama especially during the discussion of politics and religion).  But for the most part, the VR social community opens up a new way of communicating much different from ZOOM and for people who have anxiety or feel awkward about their personal appearance, many have said they took up VR for that purpose.So, for the most part, the Oculus Quest 2 has managed to change the lives of many people.It's important to note that I also tested out the Oculus Air Link which allows you to hook up to the your laptop wirelessly, so you can play VR games that are installed on your PC/laptop.  And you'll need to purchase a USB-C link cable for the Oculus Quest 2 separately, if you want to transfer files and also for those who want to run code on their device.  One of the things I do is I record my gameplay and I transfer the video to my computer.And for me, it has changed my life because the inability for me to feel safe working out during this time, I like the fact that I can work out but be entertained.  For nearly two years, I have been working out indoors and to be frank, while things worked out fine for the first few months, I grew tired to the point I stopped working out because it became more routine.  But on VR, you can workout because its more immersive, you can compete solo or with others and be immersed.Unlike a console game, you are working out your muscles through full body movement.But VR also opens the possibilities for many, especially for those who may have a disability, there are games that you can partake in, as long as you can use the controllers or even hand movements and of course, see the visuals.  I also have read about athletes who have been injured and can no longer compete professionally, who have found a second life through VR, they can train and partake in competitions through games.But also for one's mental health for those who want to be more social but are not yet ready to be with a group of people, but are able to do it in the virtual world.  And I like that many mental health clinics have services to provide special programs for those that need help.Now, you probably can tell what I've wrote so far, that I'm quite positive about the headset.  But is it perfect?Now as for the hardware itself, if there is one thing I do miss, while you can add spacers to wear glasses, the Oculus Quest 2 has three settings by moving the Oculus lenses to obtain the narrowest at 58mm, the middle setting at 63mm and the widest at 68mm.  In the past, you can easily choose and  manually set a variety of ranges to suit one's vision, so if you wanted 60mm, you can't do that.I did replace the headset, you can purchase the Oculus Elite headstrap or other similar headstraps that are more padded and a better fit and are easy to adjust.I also replaced the facial interface, because I sweat a lot and so I wanted something that handles sweat much better, but if you have friends over, I can easily switch out foam with replacements, so multiple people can play and I can introduce more people to VR.  I also purchased universal disposable hygiene covers as well.I also added a skin for the headset and the Oculus Touch controllers, more for protection and I don't want staining or my device to get dirty.But I also purchase a special mat for VR gaming, so I know when I'm moving too much and I can tell when I feel the ridge of the mat that I'm moving to far that I may hit the wall, the couch or getting too close to my aquarium. Because while the Guardian on the headset will show you that you are leaving the safe zone, because you are immersed in the game, sometimes you just fail to pay attention and thus, the mat really helped out with gameplay.Overall, I feel that now is the time to get into VR.  The number of people who are becoming VR gamers and also taking part in the VR community, may it be through a social platform, competitive gaming, etc. has grown.It's changed my life to the point that I look forward to donning the headset at the end of a workday and I have to work out and visit the social community later in the evening and communicate with others.  For adults, this is a wonderful, innovative hardware to own that can be a life changer for many.But like any technology, many adults use it for competitive gaming, casual gaming and social chatting.  And as I know many parents will purchase children headsets, thinking it's another pass-the-time gaming, the problem right now is that certain VR social platforms and even certain games will have children who will talk, cuss and there are few who try to ruin one's experience or those who try to be involved in adult conversations where it's not appropriate for them to be part of.But for the most part, owning the Oculus Quest 2 has more positives than negatives.The Oculus Quest 2 is fantastic, and while not perfect, the improvement in VR technology these last few years and the growing number of things one can do in VR makes the Oculus Quest 2 one of the best investments one can make for 2021.Highly recommended!

My wife purchased the Quest 2 for my birthday not realizing it was a Facebook/Meta product. A Facebook account is REQUIRED to use the Quest 2, which is an absolute dealbreaker, so we are returning it.I work in data science and know exactly how FB can abuse even just the metadata from this device. I will never, ever, EVER allow a Facebook device with black-box software, cameras, and sensors into my home—and neither should you.Update: Returned. Good riddance.

Oculus, a.k.a. Facebook, lies and manipulates consumers. Tons of the features they advertise will not be available to you if you buy one of their devices. Think you’re getting a 120 Hz display? You’re not, and if you think you should be based on their advertising and patch notes, they will hide behind their labeling of such important features as merely “experimental.”On top of that, they’ve demonstrated their intent to put ads in *paid* games. There was a backlash against the first attempt, so the developer of the game backed down. But, it’s just a matter of time - they’re simply waiting for peoples’ attentions to wane and tolerance to set in. It’s Facebook, so you know games are going to be absolutely clogged with ads as soon as they feel they can get away with it.Oh, also, the face covering could mess up your face. Mine caused me to break out in a rash. When I contacted them about this, they just said “nope, sorry, it’s not a problem,” only to be forced to admit that it *had been* a problem a few months later when they issued a recall. Shady.In short, save your money and buy from an honest, reputable company before buying into Facebook’s predatory ecosystem

I now own 2 Quest 2's, though one I immediately gifted. I got my first in November of 2020, and ever since have enjoyed it immensely. It's not just a gaming headset, it's a media device, it's a relaxation tool, a workout device, and of course a solid gaming headset. There's more to it than just playing games, which is why I can recommend it to so many kinds of people. Let me explain why that is.The Quest 2 is first off, a lighthouse free device. No set-up of little boxes to see the headset in the corners of the room or on the ceiling. It uses Cameras on the headset, and a virtual boundary that you draw when you start up the headset. You do have to confirm the boundary or re-draw it every time you turn it off and back on all the way, not just let it sleep, but that's a minor issue. Tracking is not as solid as a lighthouse VR like a Steam Index, HTC Vive, Etc. but very usable. There are times where it's a problem, mainly sniping in games like Hotdog's Horseshoe's and Handgrenades, but that's a minor issue. Plus many slight imperfections in tracking are being accounted for by game developers such as Anton of H3VR to make the experience with Camera tracking better for more precision with less precise tracking methods.The media playing of the Quest 2 is very good. You can pull up 3 browser screens at once surrounding you in normal Quest mode with tabs open in each one outside of the active tab. I've had no issues related to compatibility between the Quest 2 Browser and any site, especially when you can request the Mobile or Desktop version of the site if it doesn't work on one. I have not tried putting files directly onto the Quest 2 for playback, so I can't speak on that. The screen on the Quest 2 is very crisp (though not 4K by any means) to where I don't have any issue watching a movie on it with the normal resolution.Comfort wise, I think this is one of the main drawbacks of the Quest 2. The stock strap is good, I used mine for a long period, and still go back to it for certain use scenarios. However, it's not as secure as I want for movement intensive games like Beat saber, even if it won't fall off. Ever since replacing the strap, I've had less headaches with the Quest 2. It also can strain the eyes, but I personally have less issues with that than most. I've played on a Quest 2 for 10 hours straight, and my eyes felt slightly bothered. Not saying everyone can do that. They also recently added a Silicone cover to all Quest 2's or the ability to request one for your Quest 2, which feels much better than the foam alone. The foam to me felt like sandpaper after only a short period, and that cover feels like what it should have been before. Some people will have issues with the Quest 2 using a 3 position IPD, which will change how well you see the lenses. It's a ""three sizes fit most"" type solution to IPD adjustments. Some people will fall outside of the range of the IPD, or even in the right range won't be perfect, but I've had no issues in the default 2 position it is shipped in. It's also easy to set that position, just slide the lens left or right. Controllers feel good, and should fit most hands, they also only use 1 AA each and last for over 10 hours easily.For gaming, there's 2 different answers to how well it does. I'm breaking it up into two sections as a result. If you're not planning on using your Quest 2 for gaming, please skip this entire section.By itself: The Quest 2 is solid, though it has many limitations. It is not a replacement for a gaming computer, but it can operate many games completely stand alone. SuperHOT VR is one I personally play only on the Quest 2 by itself, and it's been out a moment. You can get many solo VR games on the Quest 2 app store, but some will have graphical downgrades over the PC versions. One example of a game doing this is Onward, a Military Sim shooter, which had to be graphically downgraded on Quest 2's to be compatible to play on the system, but still be capable of playing with true PC players. Many may also look to play VRchat on the system, while I recommend the experience, Quest users on the game are unable to see PC avatars or go to PC worlds, which is a shame. Understand that by itself, the Quest 2 is limited somewhat by it's capabilities, but many developers are designing their games around it, or for compatibility with it. It will be a good amount of time before the Quest 2 becomes an unsupported standalone system.Oculus Link: While the Quest 2 has problems running many games by itself, or have to be downgraded to deal with the processing power, it doesn't have to stay that way. Oculus and aftermarket companies have Oculus Link cables which are USB-C charging cables that are designed for high data transfer rates for a smooth experience. They are also intended to connect your computer to the headset, to use the computer's processing power to play games, rather than the Quest's. As a result, this allows you to play all PC VR games on the Quest 2. However, this hinges on your computer being able to run VR games at all, and at a smooth enough rate to make it a worthwhile experience. VR ready PC's are not cheap, but if you're already trying to play the latest intensive games at high resolution, your hardware already is likely up to the task to play in VR. Even some less powerful PC setups can be fixed to make the experience better, rendering then upscaling to the desired resolution, or other methods. This can make a game much more smooth, less taxing on the hardware running it, and more enjoyable. What you will need to run the games is far beyond the scope of this review, and you may want to consult someone who knows about computers to ask if your setup is powerful enough to run VR. Also, the Link cable needs to be secure, one tip I have is to use a strap, usually included with VR cables, and strap it to the side of the headset neat where the charge port is. This will keep the cord from dangling straight down and occasionally disconnecting the link. Also with the stock strap, run the cable through the middle of the headstrap, then to the charge port then use the individual strap, so the cable runs down your back, not your side, helps to keep you from being twisted up. One other downside is the Link does still use battery life with many setups due to the power being sent to your headset being lower than the usage, still can get many hours of play at full charge, and able to go again the next day for just as long. I don't know much about using Air Link or Virtual Desktop for wireless Link connections so, I can't comment. I tried, it didn't work very smoothly for me.Final conclusion or a TLDR: This headset is likely one of the best headsets for entering VR, for any reason. Watching movies on a big giant virtual screen can never get old to me, or meeting friends ""face to face"" on a game using the Link function, or hitting blocks that fly past me to a song's rhythm in beat saber to exercise a little in doors, whatever I use it for, it works, and well. It isn't the best VR headset out there, but it is the current best Standalone VR headset to date. Capacity wise, 128 GB is fine, but with too many games, you may run into storage problems, but seeing how everything on the Headset is digital, things are easily deleted and re-installed as needed. Resolution is nice, comfort is acceptable with some issues but minor, and the quality of the build is good. At no point have I ever thought I wasted my money on this, if anything, I wish I had gotten it sooner. Oh one other feature I want to mention is that due to it using cameras to see the outside world for tracking purposes, you can also look outside of VR without ever taking off the headset. Through passthrough, you can see the outside world in Black and White. Very handy feature that I believe all headsets after this one need to include. For the price, this is an easy sell, highly recommend buying this headset, and going from there. If you're looking for the best of the best VR PC headset, this isn't that, but it is a great entry level PC headset, that won't steer you wrong. Mine hasn't let me down, and shows no signs that it will.

I'm new to VR, aside from playing with some Google Cardboard-like devices.  The instant you put this on, it's astounding!  It's like stepping through the looking-glass, Alice.  They're smart enough to have to sit down to go through the setup routine, but there's really no dizziness.This is presented by Facebook, so you do have to have a Facebook account.  If you don't have one, signing up is easy, and no one will be getting into your private life.I found that I had a little trouble keeping focus; you have to keep it strapped tightly to your face to maintain optimum distance.  Also, there's a little bit of a light gap around my nose, but that's quickly forgotten.  There are a number of free games and applications to get you started.  I sprang for the 256Gb version (More is Better!) so as not to run out of storage in the future.  Some of the controls are a little confusing at first, but again, you get used to it.  The tutorial is good at teaching you how to do things.  It's a lot of fun, in fact!  Luckily, it runs on rechargeable batteries that eventually wear down, or else I might keep this strapped on all day long!

My husband got this for our family as covid continued to stump our less than motivated selves from gym time.  We opted for this rather than buying another piece of exercise equipment as it seemed like the most adjustable way for both of us to get a little cardio in and make the kids move.I've now had the headset for 4 months, and I still love it.  It is still working well.  My kids still play with it, but not as fervently as when we first got it (think family schedule, begging, trading, and bargaining for extra time).  Now I get it out on days I don't have other exercise planned, my husband gets it out 2 days a week when the weather is crumby and my kiddos get it out 1-2 times a week to play their favorite games.I still love it.Friends - Everyone who comes over wants to use this.  The kids have us hide it when friends come over as they don't want the friend to stay on the headset the whole time.  It is simple to set a new boundary up and prompts you when you are in a new area to do so.  They even have stationary area sets so you wont injure yourself (or your stuff) in a small area.  We take it when we travel and have friends and family play with it, for all of our amusement.  Also because quite a few folks bought earlier tech and had bad experiences, that just don't know that it can be quite this good!  When the dog or cat enters the zone the headset warns us to check to make sure the playarea is still ""safe.""  We can choose to ignore it right then (like during tai chi) or act and put the dog outside or get it a bone to chew so it doesn't get karate kicked in the face during more energetic games.Motion sickness.  I have severe issues with motion sickness and am VERY glad that the shaky cam movies that made me have to sleep off a motion sickness bout are out of style.  I can't sit as a passenger in a car, even the front.  I can't ride roller coasters or ride an amusement park ride more than once before I look like I've been binge drinking.  I can't play Portal and many Spiderman games as my brain just can't handle it.  It's embarrassing and affects me daily.  I was MOST worried about his when we got the headset.  I was surprised that when I adjusted the headset to adapt to my pupillary distance (hold the sides of the lenses and push appart) and made sure it was lined up (move the headset up and down till it looks like you are just looking through glasses then twist back strap to hold in place)... it was ok.  I do this adjustment every time and it takes under a few seconds now.  No matter who is wearing it (kiddo or man with  giant head).  I started easy with a few games that just wanted me to look around.  I moved up to beat saber and even got into supernatural.  There was one game that was a complete spiderman experience that had me hugging the floor and down for the count, but one out of the 30 games we tried.  I have a list of fitness options that don't make me ill, and get me cardio, and are fun enough that I have to ""take turns"" with my kids.  They get a little fitness and don't even notice.  I get a full sweat work out.  I have dance cardio, I have boxing, I have tai chi etc., any time, no excuses.  We even bought an extended battery pack to make sure.. no excuses.  My husband sprung for the attached heart monitor.Talking about size of the headset, I have to buy my husband hats at the bighead store.  Literally a store for folks who have heads so large they can't get baseball caps, construction hats, visors, sunglasses and other hats to fit their gigantic heads.  I myself am very tall and have to usually wear men's hats, and had no problems fitting this on my head (or more importantly my husband's huge gourd of a head).  I find with my larger forehead that I have to make sure my pony tale is not under a strap to place it correctly so I don't get any blur.As for pupillary distance, I was curious when I read the reviews about this, because man.. it is able to move quite a bit to accommodate what folks need.  I noted that pupillary distance (wikipedia posted the army study of 6000 people, mind you) noted that distance beyond 72 was more than 99th percentile.  So it is possible, to check if you have a distance more than 74mm between your pupils you can use a rule in a mirror, though honestly not sure on the sets max pupillary distance and just noting the popular review on here noted he had unusually far distance from one to the other so trying to help folks check their size (though 99% of the time should be fine).  So it is very uncommon for people to have eyes and pupils that far apart that would need the headset to move even further out, but we are human.  But it is easy to measure, take a ruler and a mirror and see how far apart in mm your pupils are.  There are walk throughs online for folks who order glasses.  If you need to make absolutely sure, but again 99% of the time it's not needed.Kids - some games are super easy for them to pick up.  Especially the games that have no set endpoint (like the work games where you can replace an engine with a potato to try and get it to run better).  Some games are a lot like the ones they play in roblox (like hole in the wall, where you have to move to be a certain shape).  Though some games you need to go into options and set to the height of whomever is wearing it.  We now have 3 games which are their favorites to go back to and 2 or 3 that they played through and are done.  The first week we had to have a schedule to play, but it has relaxed to getting it out for family time.  This is best done buy having a phone linked to the headset that allows OTHERS TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING.  We put it up on an IPAD and get to laugh along with the person playing.  It also helps for ""turns"" when someone doesn't want to give up the headset.  There are even games that allow other's to join in the silly by playing WITH the person with the headset on, they play their ipads WITH the headset person.  It is all quite silly.Facebook - I don't recall linking it to anything at this point, but we've had it for months.  If you hate that idea, use a fake profile.

I ordered 2 headsets for family fun.  Setting up an Oculus App account on my phone while waiting for delivery.  This also requires Facebook registration. Facebook just disabled my account, immediately.  They want my telephone and photograph?  Really?  Sorry, I just ordered two headsets and to be treated this way is ridiculous.  Steam, Origin, Microsoft, Sony, and other gaming systems/services don't ban anyone or require as much to join.  If you remove Facebook requirements from the Oculus, I may reconsider, but I will  never forget this treatment.  I had no idea how awful Facebook really was until my first contact with them.

Enough has been said about the Oculus/Facebook stuff, but it is truly atrocious. I've been using my Rift for years, long before the account merger debacle. I bought the Quest 2 because the hardware looked great, even though I was worried that a problem merging my Oculus account to Facebook might bite me if I ran into problems with it. Long story short: it did, and I've spent an insane amount of time dealing with useless tech support, just to let me log into an account that I've already been using for years, on the same PC, with the same hardware (my Rift) that's sitting right next to me, all of which was utterly bricked because of their poorly implemented merger.I think the Quest 2 is a great piece of hardware. But the decisions the company has made, which can potentially make your devices unusable, is infuriating. My next headset will be from absolutely anybody else.

 Cons1) be prepared to spend ALOT. I spent about $600 and I still need to eat the order to play steam vr.2) battery is necessary! 2 hour life if you don't have the battery packs.3) you have to have Facebook (if you are too tight to give out your information don't get this, they are pretty invasive)Pros1) you can cast it to your smart TV and there are active games for the entire family. I have never spent this much time in the living room with all 6 of them!2) I've been spoiled by ps5 and 4k, do not expect this level of graphics. However, the graphics are very good, I've found myself flinching in game.3) I have not run into anything yet, guardian pro program is great. When you step out of it you see the whole room in greyscale.  Please ensure everyone knows you are playing boxing!I knocked my daughter out!4) ""wander"" is essentially Google earth in 3d, this is AWSOME!!!5) Beat Saber, if you grew up with guitar hero like me GET THIS!!!!6) thrill of the fight, if you need cardio GET THIS!Had it 2 days and my arms hurt, haven't used my heavy bag (I need to switch out, no real resistance on the game and my knuckles will get weenie!)7) my last shout out my wife plays angry birds on her phone like constantly. GET IT ON OCULUS!She's not the video game player but she was on it for hours!Overall, for our actual family entertainment, thus purchase was extremely worth the 700 I will put into it overall. I'm a horizon and elden ring ps5 guy (pre-orders already paid for) but this thing ROCKS!!!!!!With the added benefit of keeping my ps5 clear when those two games come out over the next 2 weeks!!!!

The Oculus Quest 2 itself is a fantastic device. I was even using it almost every day to work out with Supernatural. Loved that it is wireless and there's tons of content for the device.The unfortunate problem is that one's Facebook account is used to log into the device and the app.Facebook suddenly decided to suspend my account, and will only ""consider"" reactivating it if one uploads a driver's license or passport.If I don't provide highly personal information to Facebook, I will no longer be able to use the Oculus or all the money I've spent on games for it.I was aware of this risk, but decided to buy the device anyway, because my Facebook account only has posts of my garden and food. I did not think it would ever be suspended, but there you go.

I had this for two months. I was really enjoying it. I bought some apps. It became a near daily recreation retreat for me, until... one day it wouldn't open any of my apps because it said it couldn't confirm my ""entitlement"" -- basically, that I had purchased the app. I went to the Oculus app on my phone to check my account, and oddly, it had logged me out. It asked me if I wanted to log in via Facebook... sure, that's what they made me do when I created my Oculus account. It said I didn't have an Oculus account, and asked me if I wanted to create one. I said yes. Big mistake. Now I've lost all my purchases. Oculus support knows this is an issue with ""some users,"" and they say they're working on a fix, but they don't have one. It's been two weeks. I'm not hopeful at this point.When I buy something, I expect it to work. If a platform like Oculus wants to check my purchase licenses every time I open an app, it better work reliably! It's a good thing these folks don't make phones or automobiles. At first I was understanding. Now I'm upset.[UPDATE: The outage I'm describing occurred on March 8, 2022 and was resolved on March 22, 2022. I'm keeping my review low because (1) this never should have happened, and (2) the company didn't issue any official communication on the matter until March 22, after the issue was resolved. Beyond that, this is a pretty incredible platform. The biggest potential improvements I could see would be to use a screen technology like OLED where blacks are truly black and add peripheral vision (though I'm not sure that's possible). Also, I don't think it's cool how they're rebranding from Oculus to Meta. It's kind of stupid because Oculus as a brand has a favorable reputation, and all the existing games and apps are branded as Oculus.]

This is awesome. Take your gaming up a level with this! I promise, you've never used anything like it and you aren't even going to want to go back to traditional gaming systems. It's perfect for adults and kids. My 9 year old and 5 year old have no problems using it.There's a ton of games to buy and you can even watch movies!This comes already charged but you'll want to charge it as you set it up and it updates. Then, you log into your internet and Facebook and you're ready to go.The only downside is that you have to connect it to a Facebook account. I don't really like that aspect but because this is so much fun and so easy to use, I won't take off any stars.They are always uploading more games and the app is easy to use and navigate.You can also get a Chromecast so that everyone can watch what you're doing on the TV, which definitely ups the experience.

The Oculus Quest 2 is undoubtedly the best entry into VR for the price of $299. You get a sharp display and powerful enough hardware to be truly immersed. The headset doesn't require a PC so you can take it anywhere with you. It's like carrying a 80in TV with you wherever you go. There is a ton of content to keep you entertained for days. My main uses are watching my shows on the Oculus while my wife is watching her shows on the TV and gaming through Steam VR. There is a new silicone wrap for the headset included in the box to address the issues that people were having with the foam around the headset.TECH- The basic set comes with the Quest 2 headset and 2 hand controllers- The screen is sharp with 1832 x 1920 resolution per eye. You can still see the ""screen door"" effect but it is minimal.- 72 Hz default refresh rate but can be set all the way up to 120Hz. The downside is higher power usage and faster battery drain.- USB-C port on side to connect to PC through Oculus Link to access SteamVR- AirLink feature works well if you have a WIFI6 5GHz with a solid connectionERGONOMICS- The headset itself is front-heavy. You can adjust the horizontal strap to get a tighter fit and the vertical strap to align the headset to your eyes. I didn't get tired of wearing the headset but it does fog up on occasion when you engage in strenuous activity.- The controllers are lightweight and comfortable. The buttons are ergonomically positioned and very responsive. The tracking was near instantaneous, never once did I feel a lag.APP STORE- Many VR apps and games, but you will need to hook up Oculus Link to gain access to what I consider the premier titles on SteamVR.- Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, Showtime, ESPN, MLB are represented here. The majority of these apps are just ""theater"" apps, where you are sitting on a couch and there is a screen in front of you where you can sometimes change the size. More content providers need to get their wares on this store, there should be no excuses.PROS- Price is $299 for 128GB and entry into the world of VR. Nothing else comes close to the Quest 2 specs and price.- Very portable entertainment center to take anywhere with you. Effectively replaces a game console, a large screen television and your streaming device.- You can use your hands in place of controllers, the gestures are intuitive but the hand tracking needs a little more work to be more accurate.CONS- Facebook requirement is a deal-breaking decision for some. Having an Oculus account serves the same social networking purpose to link users but Facebook wants to tap into your entire social network. Luckily you can set your privacy settings now, but for how long is anyone's guess.- Missing many apps in its ecosystem to make this a no-brainer purchase.- Requires Oculus Link and high end PC to tap into the best titles in VR gaming- Eyeglass wearers might find the headset to be restricting

I've had the Oculus Quest 2 for a couple months now, and I really like what I've seen. It offers a highly immersive and fun little escape. I'm not much of a gamer anymore, so I haven't played any of the hardcore games that the Oculus Quest 2 offers. But what I have done, is play A LOT of the PokerStars VR game! That game is free and a lot of fun.Some drawbacks that I've ran into with this system is that it's directly linked to your facebook account. Without an account, you can't do anything. Also, when facebook's servers went down a few weeks ago, the Oculus Quest 2 went down with it. There's the battery life too, which isn't that great. Usually after 1-2 hours of gameplay, the Oculus Quest 2 needs to be charged. Lastly, my wife can not use this system because only after a few minutes it will cause her to experience nausea, so just a heads up with that!All and all, I really like this console and even though I haven't used it to it's fullest potential, I can definitely see myself playing this thing for quite a while. I also believe that the tech will be a game changer in the future.

I love everything about this VR set except for the fact you need a facebook to use it.If you forget your fb pw?: No more vr headset.If you get banned off of facebook because of your ""Far right extremism"": No more vr headset.If facebook ever shuts down: No more VR headset.Facebook has down time?: No more vr headset. This has already happened once to me since ive had this.Facebook needs to learn boundries and self control. I'm not a fan. I like my privacy.Aside from the nasty facebook problem, I love this VR headset. My expectations were actually lower than what I received. I just wish they had a superhero game like hulk, spiderman, batman, or superman. Something like that. Or a gta 5 type of game. Some of the games are a lot of fun, but Id love a bigger and more diverse game library.Im actually kind of overweight and this gets me moving more and is way better than the console.One other thing that varies depending on the person is that it takes a while to get used to the vr experience. Some people can feel a bit woozy or have a headache after using VR. My wife gets it bad while I get it very lightly and my eldest son doesn't seem affected at all.

I recently cancelled my Facebook account due to the well publicized issues with Facebook and privacy issues. When I did it they cut off my Oculus.! How can they even legally do that.? I found the headset way too small for those with glasses even with the extension. Constantly blurry, and reception issues. Just try to get in touch with them to express your complaints. Impossible.!

I enjoyed the selection of games and exercises and I played them often, till my headset kept shutting off and eventually never turned back on. Okay, fine. I’ll get a replacement, I thought. Once I got in touch with a CSR they said try some troubleshooting tips. I did. Then they said  they’d get back to me within a few days. Huh? So a few days later I reached out again and repeated I needed a new headset. They finally gave me an address but said they needed days to receive the product. But my tracking number showed they received it days ago. Anyway, it’s been nearly two weeks and I still don’t have a shipment date on my new headset and they have not provided an update on anything. Great selection of games  and exercises. Terrible communication and customer service.

I bought the Oculus Quest 2 only after watching the meta.com web presentation by FaceBook seeing all the things I could do with the unit. My main goal in buying the VR unit was to play Beat Saber to work out and have fun while doing it. Of course, Beat Saber is not the only game for the OQ 2. I found many more I would like to play and did buy another, Rez Infinite (a very good game by the way).Before I could play I had to set up the device and I will admit this took about three hours because I was stupid and could not find the power button on the sid the right side of the unit. I kept punching the volume buttons. Please do not take this to mean this is a bad unit due to this it is not at all. Now the one thing you will need in terms of software is a FaceBook.com account and you can only get the OQ 2 to work with the web membership. If you hate FaceBook do not waste your time trying to get around this issue you cannot. There are other VR system units. Also, there is an Oculus account you will need to set up after hooking into your WiFi and you will have to link this account with your FaceBook account and there is no going back. This action is permanent and FaceBook makes sure you know this fact.You may ask why. The reason is simple you want a permanent record of the games you buy so you can have them in case something happens to your unit. Now that you know this there are a few things that are amazing about the OQ 2.One, the controllers, are very easy to use, and even with your headset on and just getting ready for some game time the OQ 2 tells you which is right or left. In time you will be able to do this by feeling alone but this is a nice feature. An important point that is very good is the controllers take AA batteries and come with them just pull the tabs when you are getting started in fact you have to do this.With every gaming unit, there are issues. One that cannot be gotten around with the OQ 2 that I personally have found is this: watching the images and games through the headset can strain your eyes after about 20-25 minutes to the point they hurt. I find I cannot play without a rest period of at least 10 minutes. Another issue is that if you need glasses there is an extender for the headset that can be put in easily but using glasses is still hard. Now the good news is there are companies that sell VR unit contacts that go over the lens fit to your prescription avoiding this issue. Now, this is not an ad for them. This is only a suggestion to deal with this problem with the OQ 2. One of a few.Wrapping up on this long review and I appreciate that you have read this far the OQ 2 is a very good unit for the price. What games and things I have seen such as roller coasters POV video on YouTube is great. Then there is the fact you get what I consider a lot of battery time, 3 for apps and 2 for games as an average. As for my personal favorite, the head straps holding the headset unit to your head are very well made and very easy to adjust to any size. And one last thing: you do not need headphones or earbuds to hear the sound. The OQ 2 has built-in speakers that do a great job and the headset vibrates along with the controllers. A very nice feature.I hope your experience with the OQ 2 will be as good as mine has been so far.

There is a well known drift problem with the joysticks on the controllers, and with regular use, they WILL become very difficult to use due to this inside of the two year warranty.Getting Oculus to stand behind their warranty is one of the worst warranty experiences I've ever had.  Be sure to keep your original box - there is a number on it that they need for this, and they'll also need your original receipt or invoice, be sure to keep that as well.  Learn how to take and upload video because they need that also, to see the problem.  They need all kinds of serial numbers, a drop of blood, the soul of your firstborn child, etc.It shouldn't be that hard - you guaranteed this to work for two years, it didn't.  You send me new controllers, I send you the worn out ones.  They know they will wear out inside of two years and they're banking on the hope that you haven't kept the box, receipt, or that you will get tired of answering endless emails during the replacement process.UPDATE: I am now changing my review to one star because getting them to stand behind the warranty has been one of the worst customer service nightmares I have ever been through.  The controllers stopped working over two months ago - they stalled for almost a month before telling me to send them back.  I sent them back, and they sent ONE controller to me, and it has now been ANOTHER month and they have yet to send me the other controller.  ""Customer service"" just sends me emails telling me that they are working on it.  I can not recommend buying anything from any company that cares so little for its customers.  I honestly feel like they don't care about their customers or their warranty after they've taken your money.Update 2:  It has now been three months since I had working controllers.  THREE MONTHS.

This thing becomes useless if you get banned by Facebook censors. I bought an Oculus last year, then my FB account got suspended for three days, so basically it became a brick. Fortunately, this happened during the return period, so I returned it for a refund. I also permanently deleted my FB account and haven’t looked back.The arrogance of the people at FB is amazing. They think they can sell you something, require you to sign up for a FB account and then use their arbitrarily enforced community guidelines to make your Oculus useless.

I've had mine for over a year and the games haven't gotten any better. They only have indy games which should be fine but there are basically 4 categories, Shooter, horror, productivity and jump scare. Where are the AAA titles? Where are all the ports? Instead we keep getting what seem like demo's and just more of the same. Also, this thing is heavy on your head. It is not comfortable and the passthrough feature is like watching potato-cam footage. I would not buy this again. I didn't want to write a bad review of the Quest 2 but I lost interest way too soon and now I don't really care if the platform is abandoned, Facebook was not the best steward for this type of tech. They should have paid for more titles but they didn't or if they did, they only bought garbage, cheap android games.

I had tried a friend's Oculus Quest a couple of years ago and was really excited about the opportunity to own one myself. While we can geek out on all the capabilities, processing speed, and resolution the magical part is that quickly after putting on the headset your brain takes over and you just accept the new reality. That said, these really are a pretty amazing piece of hardware with essentially a whole computer you can wear on your head.FaceBook did a keynote not long ago where they talked about the fact that they are doubling down on virtual reality as a key part of the ""metaverse"". The good news is that if there was any question about if Oculus was going to have support from FaceBook their parent company they have made it clear that under the new company name ""Meta"", Virtual Reality is a big part of their vision. They also answered some questions about the future or the product with some ideas like at a future date you will be able to use Oculus without a Facebook account and you'll be able to separate your business virtual reality from your personal one.For playing games, the Quest is an amazingly immersive experience and I love that it is active. I regularly build up a sweat playing games on the Quest.The one experience I feel like the Quest isn't quite there yet is media consumption. It is awesome that there are apps like Hulu and Netflix on Quest and the idea of having a virtual screen the size of a movie theater is incredible. If you are in a situation where you don't have access to a TV, it would be a great way to consume media. For most people, it is likely that they are using their Quest in the same room as their television and you'll have a better picture just watching your TV than using the quest.Overall very happy with the ""Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 128 GB"". It is a great experience and definitely the future of not just gaming but many asp[ects of life.

If you've never tried VR before THIS is the way to start!The Quest 2 is an amazing addition to the library of VR options available these days. First off the device itselfIts VERY lightweight! When I got the box I was curious if it actually had a VR unit in it. It did obviously! The device is very modest in size and weight. Don't let that fool you, this is a very powerful machineSetup is quite easy. Most will require an update and depending your internet this could take awhile. Also be aware there is a required facebook account (which is obviously free) which some complain about but personally I don't see why all the gripe since its a device designed by facebook.There are several options of customizations for this. From straps to face covers etc, making you're quest easily able to fit your needs.Graphics are superb, competing with high end very expensive units. The resolution and refresh rate is even better than some high end pc VR units!Best part is the quest 2 can easily run WITH your PC. An excellent feature enabling you to (with some additional software) play games that are PC based, ON your quest 2 with the higher refresh rates. THIS is awesome because with again, the right software you can play wirelessly, making VR VERY immersive!Given this DOES require a high end PC and wifi connection.Gaming library is expanding nearly everyday! Some games are just gimicky like alot of vr titles these days but several high end games are coming out. I wont mention any but they are easily researchable , and strongly suggest checking out the libraries available.Battery life is 'ok' at roughly 2 hrs of gaming, but several options available allow increasing that, from battery pack addons to corded play.Durability is okay, just obviously don't treat it rough cause it IS a high tech machine.Onboard sensors are the best part for you don't need any external sensory devices like other VR devices out there so its purely a true standalone device. Easy to just pick up and play at your convenience.Also built in with a guardian feature which allows you to set boundaries preventing you from destroying furniture and or things like your TV depending where you play LOL.The controllers are VERY comfortable! And the battery life is amazingly epic. The power stayed at 100% for days of playing before it started dropping. Compared to other devices which batteries may last a few days I could see these puppies lasting weeks if not longer. They are very sensitive controllers and the quest 2 now features 'hand recognition' so with some apps and games you don't even need controllers!If you never have tried VR I strongly suggest starting with this hardware. Its not very expensive but very high end on the spectrum, and it will be a good investment assuming you are into gaming and VR gaming.Seriously check this out if interested in VR. Whether new or looking to check out new hardware, totally worth it and one of the best priced hardware's I've seen.

This is the new Oculus Quest 2, which is basically exactly the same as the older Quest except that it comes with half the memory, 128Gb of inbuilt storage rather than 256Gb and is priced $100 cheaper than the 256Gb version.The Quest 2 is the perfect entry level headset to find out whether or not you like the VR world.  Some people don't  like VR for various reasons including vertigo and the feeling of getting sick, neck pain as the headsets are fairly heavy on your head etc.  Other people love it and spend hours on it.For your money your will get the headset itself, a fairly comfortable elastic strap to attach it to your head, two controllers and a charging cable.  Setup is fairly simple. You connect it to your phone using bluetooth and just follow the prompts.  You will need a Facebook account to tie it to and this puts some people off (I understand why) but the majority of people already have a facebook account anyway.The Quest 2 has 2 1832x1920 LCD screens. Not quite 4K but a higher resolution than HD.  For the money this isn't bad, especially considering the higher resolution Rift S is double the price.  The eye pieces are slightly adjustable to 3 different positions, dependent upon the size of your head and space between your eyes.  One great thing about the LCD display is that you can adjust the frame rate.  I have mine set to 72Hz which I feel is much smoother than default 60Hz setting and this makes me much less prone to feeling sick.  There is also a 90Hz refresh rate however for PC gaming that is too high unless you have a seriously beefy graphics card.  Note however that you do not need a PC to use this.The headset also has 3D capable audio built directly into the headset.  The sound quality is OK but nothing outstanding. As such a lot of people also wear headphones when using the Quest 2 and there is a built in 3.5mm audio port to hook your headphones into.  Personally, the sound is good enough for me and I prefer using it without the added weight of a pair of headphones.The headset is quite heavy and although the soft elastic strap that comes with it is adequate, I would highly recommend purchasing one of the Elite, hard backed straps that you can find on amazon. These do make a lot of difference in distributing the weight, making wearing the headset much more comfortable and you can wear it for longer.The Quest 2 has hundreds of apps and games available for it, from watching netflix and shooting games to fitness and boxing games.  Even games such as boxing do help you to get in shape as you quickly find yourself ducking and weaving as well as throwing punches as you get immersed in the gameplay.  These games are stored in the 128Gb of memory in the headset and aren't that large so even with 128Gb you should have plenty of room for a number of games and apps.You can also attach your headset to your PC and play VR games on your PC.  To do this you will need to buy an Oculus cable. The official one comes in at $80 which is very pricey.  You can find third party cables that do the exact same thing for much less.  I love to play DCS and Flight Simulator 2020 on my PC with the Quest.  The immersion takes it to a whole other level, however in order to do so you will also need a fairly beefy PC to handle the graphics.  My PC is a couple of years old, so its not powerful enough to turn up all the textures in Flight Sim to Ultra, but it is good enough to play with reasonably high definition.  Honestly this is the main use I have for the Quest 2.  At somepoint I will probably upgrade to the Rift S, but a new PC is in order before that.So if your interested in dabbling with VR or don't have the budget to buy the Rift S then I would highly recommend the Quest 2.  This 128Gb version, coming in at just $300 is well worth the money and I very highly recommend it.

I have been playing with this for a little less than three weeks now (so that I could deliver the most thorough and accurate review possible). And, overall, I am really pleased. Now, this is not my first experience with the Oculus: I did have the first gen one. And, a lot has changed for the better (which is truly impressive).Foremost, this is way lighter than the first gen Oculus (which is great). And, the battery here has a longer life as well (which means more play-time without a break for a charge ... and I love that).Now, unlike the first version, the ""focus range"" here has preset numbers instead of the range that was available in the first gen. So, there are larger increments which may mean very slightly less overall clarity.This is truly so much more comfortable than the first gen version. The first one was very front-heavy (which we would sometimes counterbalance with a little weight on the back). Here, you don't need any mods at all: it has great balance. (And that is the absolute best!)Overall, this has great hand-tracking which allows you to operate the Oculus without any controllers at all. And, that will always amaze me!Beat Saber looks great, the game is great, and there is even a 360 mode which this Quest excels at (since there are no wires unlike the Valve Index).Likewise, there are so many free videos that you can enjoy! So, much can be watched without further investment of money (which is great for those with kids who are always seeking something new). And, many of these freebies are educational: you can learn about history, take tours of various landmarks, explore overhead views of cities, etc. You can even have a 360 experience on the moon! It's very cool!You can add Oculus friends and play games with them (which is really great for those who are maintaining their ""personal bubbles"" right now). Love that!In sum, it is 100% worth upgrading from the first gen version to this one. It's a fantastic starting point for VR! Very highly recommended!

As I've already been enjoying virtual reality games and apps since 2019 with my Oculus Rift S headset, picking up the Oculus Quest 2 was a no-brainer for me. Unlike the Rift S, which requires a wired connection to a beefy gaming PC, the Quest 2 has no such requirements and all I needed was my smartphone to set up the Quest 2 and quickly get started playing. Yay to no more twisted and tangled up wire that I have to unwind once in a while to remove the annoying kinks. 👍As a result of being freed from wires, I can enjoy my games in more environments and I no longer have to pack as much stuff when taking it to friends' houses; carrying a 10-lb gaming laptop and its heavy charger is no fun.Being free from a powered PC, of course, means a shorter continuous playtime since you're limited by the built-in battery size and life. There is a way, however, to extend your playtime through a device such as the 
X-super Home Adjustable Elite Strap with Battery Bracket
 - by strapping on a powerbank to the strap, game time can be extended for a couple more hours. Such a setup adds some weight but I consider it a worthy trade-off.My favorite VR game is Beat Saber and I was disappointed to find out that I had to purchase it again ($29.99). Due to the great exercise it offers, though, I purchased the game again, and playing it on the Quest 2 is just as fun and accurate as playing on the Rift S.Unlike my Rift S, the Quest 2 came with a silicone cover inside the box which was a pleasant surprise.Just like the Rift S, the speakers on the Quest 2 are so-so. I recommend watching shows & playing games with some quality headphones jacked in to up the feeling of immersiveness.At $299.00 (as of 2021-09-15), the Quest 2 is priced like a regular game console (e.g., Nintendo Switch) and I think it's fairly priced for all the high-tech VR you can experience and a library of quality and fun titles that are available. It's a 5-Star Win!

I bought my Quest2 4 days ago, and I can't get past the headset screen with the password # on it...Phone will not connect with FB on the Oculus APP. Many customers have same problem! Here are some of my solutions that Oculus does not give you!  1.Headset hand controls are supplied with AAA batteries  2.  User must have a FB account  3.  If user adds an Oculus account, it must be merged with FB acct  4. Smart phone must have certain 'level'  5.  Phone and Headset must both be using the same WifI account  6. Phone must have Bluetooth turned on  7. User must know the WIFI password  8.  Do not buy a USB-c cable unless your PC has a port. Many new Dell PCs have no USB-c port.  If your PC does not have a USB-c port, you can not connect to PC option for games (My brand new Dell laptop does not include a USB-c port.)  9. RESET YOUR HEADSET AFTER ALL OF THE ABOVE DIRECTIONS ARE COMPLETED!

I’ll start off by saying that this was my first VR headset, and with a price tag like that you really can’t go wrong with the quest 2. The 100% wireless feels really good, and although I had to buy a 20 dollar app at the time to playing games on my pc wirelessly as well, that also worked better than I expected. From what I can tell, my headset has been absolutely limited and plagued by the OS of the headset. After about a year with this headset, the UI bugs out like crazy on the regular, my “guardian” boundary is basically unusable at this point in lower light situations where as it was fine when I received the headset. Even with a spotlight on me, its a roll of the dice whether my headset will be able to set the guardian so I can access my headset in the first place. Even after just a few months, even in the oculus menus, the display will freeze as you’re moving which has made me sick on a couple of occasions. However, once I get past all these hurdles I cannot say it isn’t an enjoyable experience. If you don’t have a PC and want to try out VR, this is a must by. Based on my performance issues, if you have a PC and plan on utilizing it with your headset as well, it may be worth buying a different headset if your wallet allows for it.

I have heard a lot about virtual reality devices but never got a chance to experience what VR was and decided to give the Oculus Quest 2 a try.The device itself is nicely made but very intriguing. It is a pretty big unit that sits right in front of the eye, it is not too heavy but definitely carries some weight but is tightly secured thanks to the strap.The set up was quite easy as all I had to do was download an app on the phone which then communicate with the Oculus.I get motion sick very easily and was a bit worried I would not last long with the device but the library of apps and games is extensive and contains many options that are not zero gravity and are ground based.I started with the virtual visits of places around the world and I have to admit that it was an amazing experience as I felt that I was really visiting the country. I also tried a few games and it is definitely a huge difference over the console games I am used to as it really made me feel that I was inside the game.All in all, I have to say that I found the Oculus fantastic, I never thought that it would be this realistic.  I am glad I finally got a chance to own one and it goes with say that the Oculus Quest 2 gets a perfect rating from me.

I honestly didn't know if I'd even like VR, but the Oculus Quest 2 and the game Beat Saber (which you need to purchase separately) changed all that. I never thought of VR as an ideal place to get a workout. Beat Saber, which is a must purchase for the Oculus, gets my blood flowing and body sweating more than working out at the gym. The headset comes with an optional silicone covering which is very helpful as I can't believe just how much I sweat using this thing. I also purchased The Thrill of The Fight, which is one of the toughest and best boxing games i've ever played. Beyond games, I've enjoyed exploring VR worlds on AtlspaceVR, Facebook's Horizon's and VR Chat.I really like how the Oculus Quest 2 defines the playspace, there are options for both a fixed guardian and a custom guardian so you can define your play space. They also have the option of adding your couch and computer, so you can add both into your home VR Space.The Quest 2 has held up pretty well with one notable exception, the wrist straps aren't awesome. This can be easily remedied with an aftermarket controller wrap, which can add a much helpful ant-throw palm strap, which I greatly prefer.

Pullitzer and Hearst never had anything like the total control Facebook and Twitter have over our entire society. Because you could choose to just not read the newspapers and you wouldn't have your real life family and friends pressuring you to read them and feeling personally rejected if you won't. That's power you can't buy. Speaking of things you can't buy, anyone who is banned from Facebook for political wrongthink because they made an effective argument that could have changed the course of an election against Facebook's preferred candidate can't buy the Oculus Quest 2 because a Facebook account is required.

I bought this product to share with my nephew, after using it for about a month they got really hot and cold on fire and burned to the side of his face. They sent me a new one which was obviously refurbished. And now that they’ve merged with Facebook they’ve raised all of our passwords and email accounts and will no longer let you get on there regardless if you have your previous information or not. I said on the phone for four hours tonight trying to get this figured out and I got nowhere. I would buy a pair of binoculars and ducktape damn on my face and play Nintendo before I would go through again. I received nothing for my nephew getting burnt in my house almost catching on fire.

First for Amazon…I actually bought this at Target so sorry you can’t verify my purchase.Now for the review…this system is a ton of fun and definitely worth trying just for the experience. It’s disorienting in a really fun way and you can cast what you are seeing to a tv for others to sort of participate.Set up was a problem for me. It would not detect Wi-Fi no matter what I tried. I looked online and found it was pretty common. I tried connecting with support but there was a crazy wait time. Luckily I found the factory reset and that fixed it, but I may have just returned it if that hadn’t worked.The battery lasts 2 hours which I thought would be fine, but you spend lots of time just looking around at different apps and handing the header back and forth with friends so the time flies by. We bought the elite head strap with battery for another 2 hours of game time but that added $100 to the cost. Definitely worth it, but anyone buying should expect they will likely need that as well.Before buying any games I would recommend playing free demos. There are not many out there but enough you can get a feel for what you like. Some games, like Creed, I didn’t like enough to buy, but playing in demo was a really cool experience that I would recommend everyone tries at least once.Lastly, the games are mostly around $30 so just be prepared that you will likely spend a couple hundred more than the initial $300 to get the accessories you want and the games you want.

Don't buy Oculus! Get a vive or valve product. Facebook is an Advertisement based tech org. They historically have stopped supporting all their previous products when the upcoming release of the next product line is close. This is predatory! I have a Rift S that simply has a dented Display port end and I cannot get another cable. The entire system is useless and they wont sell me a simple cable. They want me to purchase a completely new product.Go with a vive, they still sell parts for their original product lines via a third party broker. Don't let Facebook corner you like they did me expecting that I purchase a new entire product instead of supporting the unit that is less than a year old.Also, if you are buying games, get it on Stream if you can. If you ever jump headset manufactures, you will still have access to your games on steam. If you buy from Oculus, they are no longer accessible once you jump brands.

I thought it was a gimmick, so I waited a long time to get into it, but truth be told - it's pretty unreal. Blew me away.It's good to know that if I'm every permanently disabled, or bedridden or something, that this thing exists. I can see myself rockin' out at 95 with one of these.A few points:-The VR game selection is a bit limited at this point, as the technology is still in it's infancy, relatively speaking. That said, there's still bound to be something that you'll like.- You can hook it up to a computer, and experience any of your games and programs on a virtual screen, in front of you. It's not much different from using your computer anyway, but it's good if you want to chill in a chair or something w/ your computer across the room. Get the cord, tho.- ""Adult entertainment"" has made it worth the price of admission, alone. I'm not kidding - this is next level stuff, here. Do yourself a favor and just grab a fleshlight, too. Dont forget the astroglide!In closing - it's well worth the 300 bucks.  I've experienced things that I never would have, before.The 128 gb has been fine for me, that's more than enough room to install whatever games. As far as entertainment goes, you can stream all of that. There is no reason to actually download movie content, and if you really want to have a backup of movie content, you can surf to the site on a PC and download it to a drive for safe keeping. Transfer it to your headset if you ever need it.Just do it

This is your gateway drug into the metaverse.  When you wear it replaces your real environment with an artificial one.  You draw a circle around yourself to create a safe area for you to move.  When you approach the boundary a virtual wall shows up.  If you cross it the real world replaces whatever you were doing.  It is extremely well-executed and necessary because you are entire, I debating using a lesser word than entirely but it fits, transported to somewhere else.  Even if the experience is lowres as some are the kinetic realism of immediate feedback to movement and how you move your body and head pull you in.  What you experience is total immersion in a generated environment.  The experience alone is like paying pong  40 years ago.  It was fun but mostly we all knew that pong was just a start and this was going to change the world. This is not pong, it is way past that, but the experience is so complete that while things are going to get better and better the overall encapsulation of your senses is already happening.  Until we just plugin, which is what this feels like except for the brick strapped to your face that in 5 years will be glasses or something more reasonable.  It's not hype and I feel old given how advanced this technology is and that I had no idea of what is going on.  You will need a better strap and a USB battery that has a type C connector to plug in the headset to extend it on time.  You probably have all that for your phone and other devices so the smallish battery on the unit is not a big deal.  I feel this is a mush have experience if you want to be up on where things are and will be.  I bought mine at Cosco because if Costco is selling this I know it is mainstream and I didn't even know it existed.  My mind is completely blown at this point.  If you live in a small space this will create a huge world in it, like the tents from Harry Potter that are small outside and enormous inside.  It feels like that.

I bought an oculus about 6 months ago, back in may the facebook email 2fa system started to not send emails. I have since been locked out of my oculus and facebook account with zero line of support.I no longer have access to my library and have to make a new account just to turn the thing into anything other than a paperweight. I have support tickets open since june that the most fruitful thing to come from it was an autogenerated message from facebook.Such a massive amount of money to waste because of garbage facebook security. I can only assume since during the pandemic IT companies production have improved for the most part and since it seems I can't get one real email from facebook in 4+ months I can only assume that Oculus + facebook is still ran by one douche in his garage.

Just a very ho-hum thing.  Terrible ergonomics, horrible UX, incredibly low resolution (you will be distracted by literally seeing the pixel RGB components), horrible latency, very poor quality graphics if you don’t use a link with a decent PC (think like a not quite as good as an old Nintendo Wii), no rechargeable batteries in the controllers, no eye tracking, and on top of all of that you must have a Facebook account and share all your telemetry (read everything you do, all information that it’s cameras see, audio it processes, locations it’s used) with “meta”, and then have to pay additional through a store for the anemic VR offerings available.If you were a kid who liked to go up real close to your tv and see the separate RGB pixels then maybe you won’t mind being distracted by that with this, but that’s what you’ll see, it is not a sharp hi-res experience the actual separate RGB pixels though are distracting as anything to me, I can’t really se the image through the when it’s this low res.  Sadly this is an area that I had expected to improve since SIGGRAPH 15 years ago.  It hasn’t.The refresh rate and general latency/lag is also horribly nauseating, it seems that the screen refreshes at a higher rate but still has flicker at the edges of your eyes.  Like being under fluorescent light constantly, maybe it’s the LED refresh rate in combo with the screen, but it’s bad.  The tracking seems to be running at a different refresh rate too, you can really see it in the setup moments where you get to see the camera output.  It looks like maybe it’s refreshing at 15fps.  Either way it explains the very high latency.The fact that it can’t eye track means it can’t focus track either.  So everything in all the games is in focus at all depths.  Not so great but also every other aspect related to the eyes is bad.  The adjustments (3 positions only) manage to not quite fit anyone, the field of view is like looking through 2x lenses, focal plane is painful and convergence is so bad that it’s like doing those awful stereograms that were a hit in the 90s where you have to cross your eyes to see anything.  A few minutes of playing with this and once you take it off you’ll feel very messed up for half an hour or more.  I can only imagine the damage it’s doing to peoples eyesight.Outside of the core element being really incredibly poorly done the rest is nasty too.  This weighs down on your face, specifically you feel it tugging and pulling down on your cheeks of all things!  It’s not that lightweight, better than the ones in the 90s but not by that much.  There’s gapping around the nose area letting in light for me, the straps when lose make things worse and when tighter are just plain uncomfortable.  The padding around the face is no-where near enough for comfort, you feel it digging in, adding the optional rubber cover makes it irritate your skin.  The balance is very poor they could have brought a lot of the weight closer in, and honestly ditched most (all) of the onboard processing, they just want you locked in to their ecosystem.Speaking of there’s no way to use this without registering via Facebook.  The hell that is Web 3.0 and a lack of online compartmentalizing your life rears it’s ugly head again in the name of “consumer convenience”.  There is nothing here that you would want to share with Facebook (meta), nor should be forced to.  You basically feel violated the whole time using it and far less inclined to do darn thing with it, not that the experience doesn’t already dissuade.I honestly am having a hard time finding something positive to say about this mediocre product.  Maybe beat saber is mildly amusing for 20 minutes or so.  But that gets old fast.  It’s very uncomfortable and fatiguing (not to mention nauseating) to wear for longer periods, thankfully the batteries are eaten up fast which will stop you from extended sessions unless you use the link to keep it powered on but then you have cables.The only reason I have this thing is for software development because that’s what companies want right now.  Despite every developer I know being absolutely uninspired and depressed as hell about having to work on this pointless series of products the next generation of which will be ever more horrific violations of your privacy and moral code than you can currently imagine in the name of seizing control over the nascent NFT market by large corporations (that’s the direction in app transactions are going in already, which is the whole point of the metaverse, see PS Home and Second life for the templates of this, as well as the presentations by various tech bro CEOs, trust you will feel pressured into trying to get on that gold rush early so you too can be a millionaire from owning emperors new clothes, it’s cynical as anything), and making a more fancy but in practical use miserable privacy invading version of zoom.  So yeah, sorry guys I won’t be making the world a better place (quite the opposite), but I will be making bank off this junk.The price is good, it’s heavily subsidized by FB to get you in.  But the components aren’t great.

 I’ve had a lot of fun with this device. I really think it’s the best vr experience you can get especially for the price. I have looooved beat saber, job simulator, and super hot. Any game we get on here is a lot of fun. However I also don’t like it needed a Facebook account to set it up and if you get banned from Facebook you loose all your games. Luckily I haven’t done anything to get banned on Facebook but that doesn’t really seem fair, and that’s part of the reason people are against this push for all digital and no physical copies of games because you never truly own the digital games. Also oMeta is a creepy company and I don’t really enjoy being a user. I think changing the name from oculus quest to meta quest was a bad marketing decision and I’m never going to stop calling it oculus. Anyways though this thing has made me get my much needed exercise and realize I actually love brown a lot!!

This is the second time I've bought an Oculus headset.  I sold the first, and now I remember why I did with this second one.  It is amazing at first.  The technology works very well, and it's a surreal experience.But once you've played with it for a week or so, it get's very boring.  The content is low grade video games, and the resolution is not very good.  The headset is heavy and hurts your face.  The people you interact with inside are mostly children and nerdy adults.  Lots of time being wasted, and ultimately you realize you're waisting precious hours of your life that you could be using to do real things in the real world, which far surpasses any digital nonsense going on in the Oculus and Zuckerberg's deranged dream of a virtual world.Save your money and buy a surfboard or something.

I bought this in January after reading an article in the NY Times about a cool new workout app.  I figured, what the heck, I like tech and could afford to lose a few pounds, so let's give this a try. Now, after having 3 defective devices (and waiting 2 months for a 4th), I honestly wish I could just get my money back.  It's not worth the headache of having to deal with their customer service.  My most recent headset (my 3rd one!) died in less than a week.  I had to wait a month for them to ""authorize"" the return and then had to wait another month to get them to actually ship a replacement.  Granted, this is THIRD TIME it has broken, so I'm a bit more than frustrated that it's been broken more than it's been working for the 10 months I've owned it.  Oh but wait, now they sent me the 4th one, and guess what?  It's missing controllers.  And a charger.  Thanks Oculus!  Well done!  Can I get my money back now please?

This product is a brick unless you have a Facebook (Meta, whatever) account, and will become a brick once more if you lose access to your Facebook account (or if it is banned, blocked, deleted, etc.).

Have to set up Guardian every time I turn it on because it can't remember me drawing the area the last 100 times I drew it.I had the Rift S and ""upgraded"" to the Quest 2 because it listed as having a better resolution while being wireless.  That turns out to be completely false.  It's resolution is crap unless you use the link cable and run it as a Rift, which makes it almost as good as the Rift, but still worse than the Rift S and not wireless.If your face is shaped like a chimpanzee's, you'll find it to fit well, otherwise, there will be a huge gap right below your eyes even with the strap tight enough to leave marks on your head.It constantly crashes, displays a black screen, while playing or browsing menus.  I do not know why, my Rift S never did anything like that.If you wonder why other makers VR sets are twice the price, there's a reason.  Oculus is dollar store quality with the added benefit of Facebook anti-privacy.  Don't waste your time, I've done that for you, get an HTC.  I did get the Cosmos, works great, fits great.

I love new technologies and it's been awhile since I've been watching VR tech.I've tried the original Quest from a friend and I was impressed with the immersive experience you get whether you're watching or gaming.Now with this Quest 2, the resolution is simply much better magnifying the immersive experience one gets on a VR headsetSetupI'm wearing a glass but I found that I don't need to wear one to use the Quest 2. My friend who wears a glass said it's still comfy to him while wearing the set.Initial setup is pretty easy. The 2 controllers are already connected and it asks to adjust the lens as needed.Account sign on - Many people (including me) are turned off of the way Oculus requires an FB account to log in. For me and I think for most, it's a privacy issue and FB is not that known to be an advocate of that. What I did, is I created a separate fresh FB account and that's what I used to log in to Quest 2. So far so good.Here's my favorite games that I play: • Super Hot • Beat Saber • Eleven Table Tennis • Vader Immortal 1-3I occasionally browse youtube VR contents, watch Netflix, HBO Max moviesWatching Youtube in VR is a different level of experience.Optionally, you have an option to connect this to a VR-ready PC to take advantage of the vast PCVR games only available to PCs.This allows you to play much more selection of games via PC. There are 2 ways to connect, one is wired via Oculus Link cable (purchased separately) and another is wirelessly through Virtual Desktop app from Oculus store. There's a number of sites discussing the how and the requirements, just google or search Youtube.I'm able to play Star Wars Squadrons, Half Life: Alyx, Powerbeats.In case you're not aware of the news that some users reported having a rash, the box already came with Quest 2 silicone cover. I've read in the news that the incidents only happen to a very small percentage and I personally have no issue using the default face plate and I've used it for like 30mins or so per session.In my opinion, it's kinda icky to use the default face plate if you're trying to use it for extended sessions especially with games like BeatSaber or Powerbeats where you'll be sweating a lot. The default one is made of I think high quality foam that can absorb sweat. I end up using the included rubber face plate that's easy to wipe with water/alcohol every after session for better hygiene.Mixed reality VRI've discovered this awesome feature just recently. It means you can put yourself inside a game and it doesn't need a green screen! There are more and more games being added. You can search Liv and mixed reality in Youtube for the how to videos.Overall I'm happy with Oculus Quest 2. Technologies change every time and I think it's the right time to jump on experiencing VR whether for workout, gaming, watching movies, explore different places virtually. Life is short. The immersive experience is just worth it. =)

This is a great buy for a stand alone vr system. No need for trackers, not even for a computer. You can use the vr’s storage to download games to your device and play without needing to connect to your computer.That said, make sure you buy the one with Enough storage for your needs! Airlink absolutely sucks… Do some research into your connection and router, to determine if it would work properly for you. In our case it’s super laggy and unplayable, so we’d need to buy an 80$ cable, get a separate router for internet dedicated just to the oculus etc. Not going to happen, so we download our games instead to the device.The headstrap is not very comfortable, so you will want to eventually upgrade. Again, don’t get sucked into buying the elite strap, plenty of people will tell you they will break fast. Save your money, join oculus Facebook groups and look for real experiences with the different options of straps before you decide on one.The headset is a bit top heavy with the original strap, my kids found that putting a tshirt under it before putting it on, helps the discomfort…I would recommend getting an extra battery, it does die pretty fast (especially if shared between 2 people).Otherwise, great buy. Gets you moving, it’s fun and easy to set up. Make sure you have a Facebook account.

I have been using a HP Reverb G1 for a while and it is fantastic.  However, I think I may have found a solid replacement.  Clarity is similar, but I believe the Reverb is probably slightly better, but it is too close to be sure.  What has really surprised me is the temperature of this headset.  I was expecting the battery powered display to better hotter than the Reverb, but it is actually much cooler.  My first headset was a Rift and I sold it immediately because it was too hot.  Then I bought a Samsung Odyssey and it was a little better and ultimately settle in with the Reverb which gets warm but is bearable.  I was shocked when I put this on and realized it was cooler than than previous headsets even though it has an active processor and battery.  My main reason for buying this was to see if it was a good solution for wireless VR and I can confirm that AirLink works perfectly with Steam VR.  I did buy a better facial interface and an AMVR TPU back pad to help distribute the pressure of the strap and I really like no longer having a bulky piece of plastic behind my head.  I can lean back and it feels soft when I hit my head against the back of my chair.  Lastly, I have to give FB credit, even though I hate them in general, I was able to walk into Best Buy and pick this up for $299.  Having a product at a good price and in stock is definitely an accomplishment in 2021.  I can't think of any reason not buy this if you want to try VR.  It is a pretty cool experience even if you are trading the crispness of a PC Monitor for a somewhat blurred view, you gain much more depth and control of your view.  I think both 2D and 3D have a place in my gaming library.  Games like Elite Dangerous are perfect for VR while other games are better suited for high definition displays.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.

Its really really fun.  Tough to get set up because you need a facebook account to get an oculus account to get the occulus app to get the...next...next...next.  But, once it is going, its addictive, unless it makes you motion sick, which is very possible.  I was blown away by the graphics, expecting pixelated stuff from years ago, but nope.  I got the VR Hot game, and its a good workout, just make room so you dont accidentally punch people.  The game Moss was amazing, kinda short, but great and you can play it sitting down.  For the kids, Acron!  OMG its so fun.  Because the littel kids hands cant reach all the triggers at once, most games are difficult, but Acron only needs the one trigger button, so we all take turns, and it is co-op with everyone else who can use the cell phone or tablet app.  If you have kids 6 and up, I strongly suggest that one.  Battery life is pretty good, but get a back up stand alone battery for long runs if you dont want to be tethered to the charger.  Fits nice and feels good on the head.  Dont use the rubber 'eyeglasses' thing unless you need to, it locks in moisture and can fog things up and heat them up.  All in all, efverything you need is in the nice box, you can even store it in there, its that nice.  Im really happy with this.  We play at least once a week. And yes, you can cast to most devices so people can watch what you are seeing.

I really enjoyed and still am playing with the oculus, specially with high res latest content but FB (meta) track record is not promising▶ Quality & DesignNice slice white finish, really well made and surprisingly light. The remotes are also ergonomically made and compliment the design of the headset. The straps on the head set are comfortable and easy to adjust▶ SetupAs you probably aware you will need a FB account. It's pretty useless without one, so if you get kicked out or banned from FB and unable to come back you get yourself a nice piece of nothingness... isn't that greatOn the other hand the setup was pretty seamless and fairly quick. The tutorial is helpful to get the know the system and its limitations. It's nice that you can set a safe zone in your view so you wont hit any furniture or other obstacles▶ UsageHigh res stuff look pretty awesome and you probably won't get dizzy or nausea but lower res content is no fun and motion will hit your head and limit your usage as you quickly get disorientated. The remotes are very responsive and the tracking and visualization on your headset works great with minimal lag✅ Pros: Newer content, comfortable, easy to use❌ Cons: Fb account needed, lots of old lower res contentOverall, if you don't mind been bound to FB this is a really great piece to technology

Appearance:Sleek headset that can adjust to your head size.  The handheld wands  blend with the appearance of the headset.Assembly:This is plug and play.  Take it out of the box and start exploring!Installation:Only downside is that you have to use a Facebook account to log onto the Quest 2.  That is the only way this will work.  You'll also get a good number of software/firmware updates for the unit, so be prepared to wait a little bit after turning it on for the first time.  It is worth the wait though!  Pull on the headset, adjust the straps to your liking and adjust the lenses to move slightly in or out depending on how your eyes are positioned on your face.Thoughts:Man, this thing is awesome!  The graphics are fantastic and you can truly get lost in the environments.  Even the Oculus lobby is breathtaking.  Software setup is super easy.  You set your physical playzone up and the headset will track how close or how far you are from the edges.  There is also passthrough which will allow you to see the physical space in front of you, albeit from an alternate universe-type view.It's a fantastic piece for gaming, exploring (check out the ISS from the inside!), and almost anything else you can think of.  Personally, we play a lot of Beat Saber in this and it is just so much fun.  The games are fairly simple to browse, the app store could use some user experience work, but it's definitely good enough.It does get a bit warm inside the face area, so if you're playing a very physical game, be prepared for some sweat.  It might be a good idea to invest in a face mask protector so the foam portion isn't getting all wet.Overall:I love this system.  I would happily buy it again

I want to start with the issue I had with the store. Before I got this headset, I had an Oculus Rift (original generation) and in the PC store, I purchased multiple games. When I got this headset, I thought that those purchases would transfer over, but unfortunately, I was mistaken. It turns out that certain games require you to re-purchase games for the Quest store, even if you already bought them through the Rift store. Now, I was informed that developers need to specifically engineer their game to the lower-performance platform, but as a consumer, it doesn't feel good to have to re-buy a game just because it's on a different platform. I thought they would at least offer a discount on the game if it was already purchased through the other store, but apparently not. There is a way around this by using the Quest Link (or Air Link) to basically play off the PC you would usually use but with the upgraded headset and inside-out tracking, which is what I ended up using for games I had already purchased on Rift.Store issues aside, this headset is so much better than VR used to be in the early days. The ability to play without wires or backpack PCs is amazing and it's hard to imagine going back! Especially with the workout apps, or full-room movement apps, no wires is the only way to play and feel fully immersed. The screen-door effect is also very reduced when compared to the Rift. Air Link is still in Early Access, so it doesn't work without issue, but when it works, it's a great way to get the full graphics processing power of a PC without any of the wires, tethers, or tracking system setup that both the Rift and Valve Index require. Of course, there are some trade-offs, but overall, I am very happy with this headset.

Couldn't register the device because of Meta/Facebook's incredibly invasive signup requirements and broken website signup process. Need a fb account, with your real name, with phone number, photo upload verfication to be able to use the oculus 2 at all. Are you f k kidding? Are you the IRS? or a bank? You need all of my personal info so I can use your 200$ plastic device? Nah, I'm good. I'll find my entertainment somewhere else. Be careful who you give your information to.

It doesn't need any wires or a computer; you just strap it on and voilà, you are ready to play.Realism:It was realistic lemme tell ya'. Yes, creed does look like a game and not real life, but that is because it's a game and not real life. There was a giant dude with huge muscles on the other side of the arena, and we were playing a real boxing match! (though I didn't feel it). Guess what is there in real life… A wall.Motion sickness:I never experienced motion sickness while playing until I got to the game star wars: tales from the galaxies' edge. I played for about an hour with no breaks and began to feel nauseous… like I was going to throw up. That is my fault though because meta themselves say to take frequent breaks ""about every 30 minutes of play"" to rest for five minutes. I took a 30-minute walking break outside after that and things seemed to have gotten better.4 stars:Taking into consideration the motions sickness, it goes from 5 to 4 stars. I know for many people, they get motion sick not even trying. For me, it took more, but it still happened.The oculus quest two is overall a great console, it's cool, realistic, and new. I think it's amazing, and will go far in the tech industry.

I'll start by saying that my only negative is the fit. It's really hard to get a decent fit, so the words aren't blurred at all. Could just be my head shape. It does have adjusters for the width and length, as well as the eye glass part can move inward or outward.Super easy to connect and get started. Does NOT have any preloaded games, you have to buy them separately, but there are a few samples on there. We bough beat sabers with an expansion pack and a roller coaster shooting game.Note, if you are prone to motion sickness, certain games you will not be able to play....I can't stomach the rollercoaster one, but beat sabers is fine.Volume is great. Can connect to our computer screen, so others can see what you see.So far, no issues at all.

PROS.I really like the idea of mapping your area. Few years you had to use sensors. With the Oculus Quest 2. You can go to your backyard and use the handset to draw out a area that warns you if you are getting to the edge. Really cool feature.I like the idea I can put them on and have different themes. Like having a bigger office. Or a plush living room. The 3d space coaster was a real blast. And a few other things. The down side of the, like Microsoft, Google and Apple. You have a store to purchase apps. And there not cheap.Cons.IT DOES REQUIRE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT.For me? That's a Mexican Standoff! I hate social media. Against my belter judgement...I created a Facebook account. Which took a hour to do. Not to mention all the numerous things required for me to , ""Acceptance"", to go forward.I wanted to use it with my computer. Watch movies. Have a virtual desktop. So I could have 5 or 6 monitors to work with. I was able to see the computer. By just using my phone charger cable. Facebook wants 70.00 dollars for. When I can get the same for 20.00 dollars on Amazon.You can not focus the lenses. I have prescription glasses I wore when I put the headset on. No change or improvement.Some of the graphics are great! But it looks like it's 720p.At 300.00 dollars I was expecting to much. And that's what I got. Anything over 100.00? Is way to much.

I am using this with Xplane with the intent to help training as a Pilot.  I have spent hours and hours configuring and troubleshooting and it is still not right!  While the 3-D aspect is great I have struggled to get the image sharp enough to read the airplane gauges (which is a requirement to use the Xplane)Forget actually turning the virtual knobs in the plane.After spending lots of time making many adjustments and fixes, I got the resolution just barely useable.  But the Oculus refuses to recognize a USB 3 connection.  The oculus software tells you the connect is USB 2 and too slow, but ultimately the problem is the Oculus.  I have bought new USB card, cables, looked at multiple message boards, try various suggestions nothing works.  To add to the frustration the menus and steps to interface are not intuitive.  I regret buying this.  It might be ready for some techie or someone who just want to play around, but for me it has been a bomb.

I received an Oculus as a Christmas gift. It worked great and then an update came through. After the update there were all of these weird rainbow ghosting lines in the headset. I have been working with Oculus customer support for over a month trying to have them replace it. They are now telling me an additional 12 days and they will send me a replacement that is going to be a refurbished headset. The product was fine when it worked but just hope you never have to contact customer service for anything. The headset is still under warranty and I can't seem to get anywhere with them.

The Oculus 2 IS fun, however, it will NOT hook up with your Playstation 4 or 5.  It also doesn't hook up to your computer until you have, first, paired it with your smart phone or android phone with an OS of 5 and above.I am returning the one I purchased because I was under the impression that it would be compatible with playstations and it is not.  Which is quite a shame, it IS a lot of fun, I did manage to get it hooked up with my cell phone.  But I want my family to be able to use it, too, not just me.If I did a lot of traveling, I would love to keep this for playing during down time in a hotel, Beat Saber is my jam, but again, everyone wants to be able to use it, so I returned the one I purchased to get a Playstation VR so my whole household could have fun.If it's just for you, it's fantastic!  Or if you don't mind people borrowing your phone, to link to it, great!  :-)  It really IS fun.  But, sadly, if you want it for your playstation, you'll need the playstation VR.

I've been a VR enthusiast since the first HTC vive and have been watching the technology evolve closely, and I think we're finally at a point where it's worth jumping in for mainstream audiences.I admit that the facebook account requirement is philosophically annoying (I don't understand all the details but I gather that facebook/meta being able to access our use data is part of the reason why this thing is as cheap as it is), but nothing else on the market is this user friendly or powerful. In my best estimation, you'd need to have upward of $2000 into a PC and VR hardware for a setup that meaningfully exceeds with this can do.With all the potential VR has for educational experiences, social interaction, and immersive exercise, there's something to appeal to basically anyone. Some of the games can and do cause nausea and headaches with prolonged use but that's pretty avoidable. The most popular software is designed to avoid the motions that throw most people off, and you can learn pretty quickly how long you can comfortably immerse yourself.

I am just blown away by how amazing, smooth, well thought out this device is.  I am a software developer so I know the tech at a lower level than most and I am extremely amazed at how well it works.  Also the hands controls work flawlessly with the unit.  The hand controls are part of what makes this device a 10/10 in my book.  The special audio is also amazing.

I got the 128gb version of the Quest 2 and I absolutely love it. I used to have the Oculus Rift but ended up selling it because I no longer had a good room to set it up in with all the sensors, cords, and my PC. With the Oculus Quest 2 I no longer have these issues and can use the headset anywhere in my house (that has enough room) without worrying about where to setup the sensors and PC. The picture quality is good and I had no issues setting it up on my first use. It is pretty neat that you can connect it with your phone to show others what you are viewing within the VR headset. Overall the quality of the headset is great and it is so much easier to setup than the Oculus Rift.Pros:Wire FreeGreat trackingGood quality displayBuilt in audio is pretty good (and you have the ability to connect your own headphones)Good amount of games to choose fromAbility to connect to a PC to play more demanding gamesCons:Headset could distribute weight of the headset better (better options can be purchased)Not all previously purchased Oculus Rift games can be played on the Quest (a lot of them transfer over, but not all can be played unless you have the cable to connect it to a PC)Battery life isn't great for longer play sessions

Our device arrived back to them almost a month ago, there was supposed to be a 3-5 day turnaround for the replacement to be sent.  A month later and they are finally saying they are conducting an investigation into what happened to my device.  I asked if they could just send out a replacement, since the investigation isn’t my problem.  They said no I have to wait for the full investigation to play out.

My son in law brought this be headset over for the holidays. We got it working and it was neat to play with, but still felt like a gimmick than anything by revolutionary or next gen or high quality.The controller is nice and comfortable, and the head tracking is very responsive. But the resolution felt pretty low and the screen was blurry and hard to focus at different angles, even with adjusting the eye hardware. There is also a very limited number of games and apps currently that utilize the potential of the vr technology.I will say that there is a lot of untapped potential in vr technology, and I am excited for the future. But as it sits right now, it’s best to sit back and wait for a couple more generations of technology to really elevate this into a must have product.  If you ever tried the Xbox Kinect back in the day, vr right now feels very similar. More of a neat trick to experience, but nothing mind blowing or awe inspiring. Just kinda neat.

I won't repeat all the details you can read elsewhere, but I will say as an owner of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, this setup is so close for most users and activities with better clarity (as long as the IPD adjustment works for you), that this is a no-brainer for anyone interested in VR.  Yes, evil Facebook account required, but who cares you probably are already leaking privacy with everything else you have these days.The only negative is the failure of tracking behind your head, but so rarely do you do this in 99% of VR it's meaningless as a negative.  I will also say the wireless VR link to a PC to run Oculus games is a snap and works well provided you are within say 15' of of a 5G router for both devices.That being said as of this writing the Oculus Connect 2021 is on October 28th which is highly rumored  to release a new headset so you may want to wait for a price drop on this unit or get the new one which is rumored to have face and/or eye tracking and maybe even a degree of full body tracking.

We have an issue with our right controller, which is a known issue that affected many of the systems that were sent out. Essentially the AA battery in the right controller is loose and does not make a solid connection with both terminals. This is not an issue with the left controller, as one of the terminals in the left controller is spring-loaded, keeping presure against the battery to prevent it from moving back and forth. That is not the case with the right controller; both are stationary.I contacted Oculus Support multiple times. The first time they asked me for a picture of the new and old battery in the controller. Done, sent that.Then they asked me to send me a picture of the old and new batteries next to each other. Done, sent that.Then, they asked me to submit a video that shows how I insert the battery and that it is loose. Done, sent that.I'll update this review if they ever send us a new right controller for this known issue (Google it).

I'll admit I didn't care one way or the other but just a heads up for those who did, the FB requirement will be going away.For me it doesn't get better for the price, there's absolutely no better introduction to vr. What they've been able to do with the hardware compared to the specs you need in a gaming rig is impressive to say the least, at a fraction of the price. Easy to set up, decent battery life, if you decide you're infatuated with VR after and want to drop thousands of dollars to get there, it's _still_ nice having a quest.2 cons1. not having game licensed transfer between rift and quest is terrible2. The library is and will continue to be the biggest limiter. As far as what this wireless, mobile version of vr needs to be, it's pretty much there already. We just need user/dev adoption, and it's a chicken/egg situation.

I purchased the Oculus Quest 2 (256gb) locally at the advertised price of $399. plus tax, etc. No shipping delay experienced, and I had it in just a few days. Purchased as a gift for my grandson, and determined to ensure it would work, I felt compelled to check it out. Because of my immediate satisfaction needs, I had it up and running in practically no time at all. And although I had needlessly downloaded everything to my gaming laptop, I was surprised to find Quest 2  worked perfectly without a PC. It was simple, even for me, to set it up. And I find the VR to be nothing less than absolutely stunning. Loved it so much I immediately ordered another for my grandson. I’m keeping this one for myself. Haven’t yet determined how to change the touch controller batteries though. Discovered that a nitwit could do that. Glad I'm not one, though.

I purchased the Quest 2 after the Rift S PC connecting port broke after less than 2 months. After merely 3 months and less than 20-30 hours of total use, the display for the headset of the quest 2 has died. I have tried trouble-shooting with the official support site, but the answer I keep coming back to is to return it and request a new one. This is the poorest quality of equipment I have ever paid this kind of price for, ($600, bought the 256 GB).The Oculus truly became the worst VR option after it was acquired by Facebook. Please take your business to a company who actually cares about the product they produce and isn't just using it to gather more user data to sell.

The device itself is great so far, knock on wood, but their Customer Support sucks.  Just Google Oculus Support Reviews and read them for yourself.  You can only chat or email with a rep and there is no escalation point.  They will seem helpful during your first chat and they will open a ticket for you, but good luck after that on getting a status. When you try and reach out via email, no one replies back, and if you reach out again via chat for a status they will give you the run around and tell you to wait for someone to reply back to your email ticket, which no one does.  I still have no update to a ticket I opened over 3 wks ago to fix/add an account id to our expensive Oculus.  Rate the device a 5 and support a 0.

A lot of my friends have been raving about the Oculus and how it's a must have item during quarantine. After having owned one and playing it a couple of times a week, I agree. This is a great product if you’re interested in exploring the VR world.Pros:Set up is super easy and quick, you don’t need to be tech savvyYou can easily connect with other friends that have an OculusThe user interface is easy to navigateThe actual system is very well builtLarge game library and they’re affordableCons:Not the most comfortable thing if you wear glassesInstalling the glasses spacer isn’t really easy. I’d recommend watching a youtube video to make sure you’re not removing a part that shouldn’t be removed.Headstrap isn’t the most comfortable

Oculus requires that you have an active facebook account to use the product. In attempting to activate an old deactivated account of mine, I learned my account had been hacked and taken over. After 4+ weeks of going to Facebook Help Center (which is a strange loop that leads to nowhere) and being turned away from Oculus customer support--I had to return the product without ever having a chance to even play it. I repeatedly requested a phone call to resolve this issue and was only given the same links to the help page and the same copy/pasted responses from Oculus customer support.

I purchased the Oculus Quest 2 as a Chirstmas gift for my Grandson. He was excited about it and everything started out great, but around the 4th week it became very glitchy and then ended up over-heating, not connecting, etc., etc. until it finally wouldn't work at all. My Grandson was very disappointed, as he really wanted this for Christmas. Honestly, I would think very long and hard before purchasing this product.  Personally, I won't be purchasing another one.

Got Quest 2 as a Christmas present, and I am awestruck by the visuals. The device was made better than I expected, but for one thing... the head strap. IF you REALLY want to enjoy this product? BUY the Delux Headset or (better yet) the $100 Elite Strap w Battery.The strap it comes with actually harms your ability to get quality visuals, right out of the box.Next, have a PC that you can connect your O Q 2 TO, and download Steam. Steam VR is all you need to GREATLY increase your library of games, WITHOUT taking up the (linited) space in the headset.I would suggest this for MOST adults, ALL gamers, and mature young people (do NOT get it for your 6-10 year old)..Can't wait for Quest Pro and Quest 3.

I bought 2 of these for my kids for Christmas. 10 and 12 year old Girls. First (after 4 hours of play) a controller trigger broke. It sticks in and doesn't pop out. After 1 hour on Occulus Customer service chat (which was a nightmare) I was told to mail it back for a ""refurbished"" controller (not a new one).  Then 2 days later the other head set had a chip malfunction and got stuck on a load screen. Then it gave a computer chip icon..overheated and died. It died in such a fashion that it wouldn't turn off !!! .. It became so HOT you couldn't touch it. Almost a self destruct mode. So if you want your kids to be sad that their Christmas gifts broke..Get the Occulus. Otherwise, Stay away from Zuckerbergs junk product !!!

It does require Facebook account but I don’t use Facebook much and didn’t need to do more than just login to FB, and don’t see it as a problem.What surprised me the most is that I bought it as a VR headset for my PC and only later realized that Quest 2 is a full gaming console that doesn’t require a PC and can be traveled with or carried anywhere without relying on a PC. All the games are downloaded directly to Quest 2 and played on the device, though some additional games may be available via Steam account installed on a PC. So you can play PC VR games optionally. Other than that, my whole family is having fun playing golf, boxing, angry birds, shooting and action games, etc.

It does come with a cheap thin “glasses spacer” that goes inside the foam, but still fails tremendously as it’s not at all effective. The foam pushes the glasses against the  head and is extremely uncomfortable after just a few minutes or so. It’s a massive design fail on Oculus’s part. It’s as if the designers did absolutely no testing on those that wear glasses.The HoloLens does a much better job as nothing pushes against the wearers face. Oculus needs to copy their headset design as HoloLens allows the wearing of glasses with no issues and no pushing the frames against the users head.Definitely returning. Can’t say much about the experiences and games since I can’t even see anything.

It has full range of motion like the HTC Vive or Valve Index, without the need for those little tracker cubes that you have to place around the room.The headset could wirelessly connect to your PC with a click of a button, and you could play Steam VR games on it, or watch downloaded videos.It has a large library of games in the Oculus Store, and there are also a lot of VR videos to watch in the Oculus Explore page.If you have been wanting a VR headset, then this is the one to get.I use it almost every single day to watch videos, and sometimes I would play Half-Life: Alyx on it.

I bought the Quest 2 because I fell in love with games presented on Youtube such as Boneworks, Blood Trail, and Blade and Sorcery. Although, most of those popular games are only available on PCVR and the developers excuse is they couldn't optimize the games on regular VR, which is just a bs excuse imo. And there are no alternatives and/or nothing similar for those games either. That is sad. However, you can still have fun. There are other fun games available on the Oculus Quest 2 and it's an excellent experience for families and fellow gamers. I must admit that I have a lot of fun. I 100% recommend it despite my opinion. But you will never have the same awesome experience as those with a PC. It's unfair in my opinion.

It’s been 10 years since I’ve owned one. When I put this headset on, if I were to have to make a guess as to how much money it cost, The number would definitely not be $299. If somebody told me the number was between $2500 and $3000, I would believe them.

My brother’s birthday is in November, in 2021 he received his Oculus Quest 2. After trying his new present, I asked for one for my birthday in December of last year, since I have been hooked! I purchased a Nintendo earlier in the year, but I got bored fast, and I wanted something different. The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that is an all-in-one console where you can download a variety of games, talk to people, and play with friends. Everyone who has played on my oculus has loved it and I love sharing it with my friends and family, I play almost every day. The oculus is one headset with two remotes, it comes in a simple box with tabs that direct you on how to set up and open your new Oculus headset. It’s a very simple gaming system with minimal difficulty in setting up, it makes it easy for people of any age to play and it is directed towards a very wide audience. The oculus is very secure on your face and there are almost zero worries about it possibly falling off, it is adjustable to fit almost everyone. One pro to the oculus is online gaming is free unlike competitors like Xbox or PlayStation consoles. You don’t have to worry about subscriptions and accidentally forgetting to renew your subscription. That way you don’t have to worry about spending extra money or missing out on playing with friends. One negative of the oculus is it can get hot in the headset when you are playing and sometimes it can irritate your face or even leave a red ring on your face. When it gets hot in your headset it can make it uncomfortable if you play for long periods of time and in some cases give people rashes. I would recommend the Oculus. It is fun and a new exciting activity for any age group. It is definitely the best gift I ever received.

Now it is the buggiest piece of electronic equipment that I have ever owned. Constantly the screen goes black without warning. It often happens during boot-up, but can happen at any time. The only way to remedy is to take the headset off and put it back on about 3 to 5 times, or to reset it. Sometimes it goes black, but the guardian outline is still visible. Sometimes it goes black and just shows three loading dots. Multiplayer games are out of the question. Returning this piece of s___.

Oculus discontinued the Oculus GO headset and then turned off the VR function on the headsets making them useless within a few years of roll out. This was not just my experience, their Support forum is filled with people have the same issue within the last week and I'm sure that thousands more will have the same issue once they realize that there is nothing that the owners can do to resolve it. I submitted a support ticket and was advised that they are ""not trained to handle this type of issue"" and then ""I will be closing this ticket, please do not hesitate to reach back out to us again in the future for any questions or concerns that you may have we are just one chat or email away and we are available 24/7. I wish nothing but great things to happen in your life."" If you buy it, expect that you will be throwing it out and be force to buy another. Oculus acts like a drug dealer getting you hooked and forcing you to continually buy more. I'm absolutely disgusted that the tech world finds it acceptable that two years of use is all you can expect.

The lenses fog up soon after wearing it and take long time to clean up. This causes blur vision.2. I normally wear glasses but you cannot use it with glasses nor it has vision correctness feature.

This is my second quest 2 headset. I would recommend getting a 3rd party replacement headstrap with a battery pack holder. I think this is the best bang for your buck headset. It can operating independently with phone like graphics, or hook up to a PC. Overall Facebook keeps on adding new features, I like the use without the controllers.I had to go to a few hardware resets setting up different accounts with app sharing, but it was all working in the end. There is a limit of sharing of apps to only 1 headset, and the app owner must have the main account. The owner of the apps must use the other headset.  But playing cook out or mini golf is much more entertaining with a partner!

This is the best value for money device I have ever bought; we currently have 2 Quests 2s and 1 Rift CV1. I use it daily for media consumption as a giant screen (videos, live streams, movies, etc), for PC gaming (wired and wireless) and for stand-alone gaming. Also, having guests at home is never boring; priceless first time reactions from people of every age trying this.While many people have no comfort issues with the stock elastic strap, for me the Elite Strap (with or without battery) or a similar alternative replacement of the stock strap, is a must. I use an alternative strap with a power bank velcroed to the back for additional hours and better weight distribution on the head. Plugging in some over-the-ear headphones, I can lay back on my recliner for hours, not bothering the rest of the family or the other way around :)An important note for the older generation... unlike your phone or your tablet, you don't need reading glasses with the Quest. Also, if the 3 fixed IPD settings give you a blurry image, you can move the slider in between settings for better clarity. I have set mine between 2 and 3.It is definitely worth mentioning that the device capabilities, features and functions are constantly and, would say, pleasantly, being upgraded while bugs are being ironed out. Excellent work, thank you Oculus/Meta!Favorite, mostly played game: Eleven table tennis (the best simulator of any sport on any platform, ever).Unforgettable, must play games: Half Life Alyx, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Lone Echo, Vader Immortal and, of course, everyone's favorite: Beat Saber.

My son received one of these as a holiday gift. After having it for a couple of weeks, I put it on one day to see how it worked and immediately noticed a few dead pixels in the left side of the display.It's definitely not the end of the world, annoying, yes, as my eyes go right to them, but I thought for $300+ this shouldn't be the case after just a couple of weeks.I've contacted customer service and they've passed me off between two different people over the past two days, giving me the run around and asking for the same tedious information (serial numbers, addresses, etc... over and over).They are now insisting that I stick a camera in the display to shoot video or capture a still image of the dead pixel. It sounded absurd to me, but I tried it anyway and found it to be an impossible request. They won't proceed with helping me unless I'm able to do this. I can't believe it.

It’s a whole new world. There are games for everyone, from puzzle, fighting, simulation. Prices are fair for the games when on sale or in a bundle. It does lag a good bit, and can load slowly. The cast feature (to stream the head set to your tv) is very slow, sometimes won’t even come up on my phone, rarely will it connect to my built in chrome cast android tv. Also my 4 year old can’t play some games like job simulator bc he’s too short. You can adjust the floor of the boundary but how to adjust the height? Some presets for young kids would be helpful. Hopefully some updates will help this. Overall great for the money.

I absolutely love my Oculus Quest 2!This is the best VR headset in the market, hands down. One of the best things about it is that it is tetherless, meaning you do not have to worry about tripping on any cables while you have it on your head. This makes it very mobile and easy to transport. For example, it is a breeze moving between living room to bedroom and vice versa. In addition, it makes it easy to transport to your friends and family's homes.The build quality and screen quality is excellent. I'm surprised by how comfortable it is to wear compared to other VR headset models. It's not heavy at all and there is a soft foam cushion on the front to block out any ambient light into your eyesight as you use it.It is truly a remarkable experience trying out the Oculus Quest 2 for the first time. It is hard to explain. The moment you put the headset on, you'll feel like you are in another world. One of the things that really impressed me was how realistic it feels and how responsive and accurate your head and hand movements are reflected in the 3D environment. If you play long enough, you might even forget about the real world :)The sound quality is also very clear.The headset has a feature called ""Passthrough"" which allows you to see the real world even while you have the headset on. This is because the headset has cameras on the outside that project pass through video onto the screen on the inside of the headset. This is an amazing feature as it allows you to orient yourself in the real world while you have the headset on. It is also used to configure safety boundaries before you play any video games.There are so many video games on Oculus Quest 2 including Beat Saber, Superhot VR, Ping Pong, Boxing, Population One, Escape Room games, Star Wars, Resident Evil, etc. Horizon Worlds is a free VR online game that allows you to create, explore and play with other people online.I highly recommend going through the the Quest 2 tutorial where you learn how to pick up objects with the hand controllers, throw objects, punch objects, use one or two hands on objects, dodge objects, crouch and slide from objects, push objects, dance with objects --- it is really limitless the amount of things you can do with this VR headset.Additionally aside from games, you can also explore 3D artwork narrated by creative artists and even watch movies in 3D or 2D if you choose. It supports a web browser and even youtube viewing. Overall you can also burn a lot of calories from it. I highly recommend the Quest 2!

I will say that this unit is amazing when it works.  Ours had one of it’s controllers go down within six months and we had to send it back, received a refurbished one back and it also did not work.  After chatting with the company and having to jump through some ridiculous hoops, they decided to have us send back the main unit.  Not a huge fan of having to send a $300 piece of equipment back to the company only to receive a refurbished unit back!  If I wanted a used one, I would have bought one on Ebay and saved money!  At any rate, they’ve had the unit for over two weeks and can’t tell me what’s going on with it, if they’re just sending me a refurb unit, why would it take this long?  Only way you can contact them is by email and chat which is ridiculous.  I will say that they would respond within 24 hours by email which is great but back and forths like that still take days.  Also the last few of my emails have gone unanswered.  Spoke with them tonight via chat and got less info from them then I even did a week ago!  I will say that this process that began back in June or so is partially my fault because it was summer and we weren’t using it as much, so I mistakenly put it off, but the main jist is that it worked for five months, takes days upon days to figure out what the problem may be and a long time to get the issue dealt with.  Having a technical support number would be a must you would think!!!

This is my first VR headset and so far I'm really loving it. I've downloaded Beat Saber, Supernatural, Eleven (table tennis), Super Hot, Premium Bowling, Tripp (mediation), Creed (boxing), Racket and Blade & Sorcery. The last one will take me some time to get the hang of, but I love the rest. I've always been very sedentary and have weight to lose, so even low-level activity in these apps cause me to break a sweat and I feel great afterwards. I actually look forward to my Supernatural workouts every day! The best $299 I've spent in a long time. Definitely recommend.

What is this device we have here? It looks like goggles you would need to go through a sandstorm or a snowstorm. “Virtual Reality” I did not know technology could excel this quickly. I am from another world, and it looks like I am from the past from just seeing this stuff, but I came from a year that is higher than your’s? It’s 2022 at your time, but I came later. I am from 3000, it looks like your technology was more high tech then my own universe I came from. Interesting. We are close to something like that. We have the View Makers, but they aren’t like your View Makers. They are used by people to view their surroundings that are invisible to the naked eye. From my universe there are people that hide from us, and we use these to find them, or find where they were.

Definitely DO NOT recommend.Worked great for about 10-15 hours game time then the grip button on the left controller got stuck. Sent my controller back in to support as requested. Once it’s in heir hands they tell me there is “a bit of a backlog” with no estimate on repair time. Now I have a $300 paperweight. Definitely would NOT recommend as it seems to be an ongoing issue.UPDATE: Coming up on a month from sending in the controller for RMA replacement. Facebook has acknowledge receiving the controller but will not give any estimates on the replacement shipping, simply saying they are working on it. The documented email support conversation says 3-5 days for replacements to ship.

I have one that I purchased and my son loved it! I say loved (past tense) since when someone Hacks your account and changes your email address, password and phone number you are done! No support and they run you in circles as the account holder although they recognize you've signed in on TWO different devices so enter your password, ""you have entered a wrong password but we will send it to you"" (The Hacker because everything has been changed!) I Uploaded my License as asked when I went to their site to prove my identity but still didn't work as it was easier for the Hacker! My young son is upset since all of the games I purchased for him (several hundred dollars) were from his achievements at school. BEWARE! If it happens to you, you're only option is one of their outside firms, the Class Action that is gaining momentum, the flyers that some in-store employees are handing out to parents (at least the non-commission ones) or just protect yourself better than our 14-24 password with upper, lower, characters galore and nothing to due with a name or birthday or pet or anything else.

So I received my quest 2 this evening.  Seems to be well packed and the opening /unboxing experience left the impression that this was going to be awesome and fun... And then I turned it on. Couldn't get past the pairing screen the left controller wouldn't show up even though my phone app showed that it was paired. Got on the support website followed all the troubleshooting steps to fix the problem... No joy. Used the support chat. Followed the directions of the tech including a factory reset and still the device doesn't work. I am told the Tech will email me with what to do next after he takes a bunch of personal info. I am left waiting for an email and no idea what the next step is or how long to expect it to take. After a few minutes I get back on support chat trying to find out how long this process is going to take and find out that I am supposed to wait 3-5 days!!!!! Seriously? I just spent over $400 on something that doesn't work and I can't use at all and you expect me to wait 3-5 days for a response to try to solve the problem???

This device is a good way to immerse yourself in the VR world to take a break from the harsh reality.My main concerned is the FB requirement.

This headset would be 5/5 stars all day, if it didn't require you to login with your Facebook account.  Aside from that, this is the perfect headset for anyone wanting to get into VR, but don't already have a high-end PC.  Heck, even if you do have a high-end PC, you can use this headset WIRELESSLY to play your PC only VR games.Oculus are constantly updating the firmware for the Quest 2 and unlocking more of its potential features.  For what you're getting the $299 price tag is better value than any other headset on the market.

First of all you need a facebook account to even use this thing, which is by itself one of the worst issues about this headset. Second, the app is buggy and trash, and not to mention a lot of features on games such as VRchat are not available and requires you to buy a link cable. Another issue is the lenses aren't great and the graphics are very sub par when compared to its PC headset counterparts. Plus there's no motion tracking besides the basic headset and controller tracking. My advice would be to save up and pay for an HTC Vive or a Valve Index. Best thing I can say about this is it runs sub par iphone games

When playing games, the right lens goes dim at random times. I reached out to oculus support and they wanted to send me a refurbished unit. I had just paid $400 a month earlier so getting a refurbished one was not something I was ok with. After requesting a new unit to replace my faulty one, I have not heard anything from them in 2 days. The games are fun, just hope that you do not get a faulty unit as you won't get a new replacement.

I have a couple of VR headsets (Pimax, Odyssey+) and the Quest 2 is my favorite to use for VR games. I like showing friends and family the Quest 2 because it’s easy to get setup and use.Anyways, we had family over for Christmas and I turn on VR Drunken Bar Fight and let my cousin have at it. She was having a great time but went around the room and almost punched the TV a couple of times so I had to stay behind her to guide her. Long story short, she turned around and clocked me in the face! My face is fine, just a small bruise and scratch but I was surprised the controller was fine!

So I couldn't find a spot to review on oculus website. I didn't purchase this item on Amazon I picked it up at target. It's fun a d the experience is amazing. But what I have learned is the foam on the head sets gives a rash on the face. I looked up and saw other reviews for the same issue. Not once did it say on the box may give skin irritation. I got it yesterday and played for an hour or so and woke up this morning with my face burning and swollen. It eventually got really bad to where I had to see my doctor to get a shot to calm it. After I looked at reviews they recommend a silicon cover for the foam. I notice I do have one that came with the box. It's painful and the $299 isn't worth it when you go threw this. Do your reviews and take the chance if you would like. I'm so glad my kids didn't play on it because it would be terrible for my kids to go threw this. Be careful and if you don't listen then be prepared if you get the same reaction as me. It's not fun anymore.

I got this as a gift, and it's one of the stupidest things you could ever own. You might play around with it for a few hours, just figuring out the mechanics, or going to a ""virtual concert"" in a chat room, but in very short order, you're just yearning for a normal joystick, or keyboard and mouse. The technology just doesn't seem to be there yet- it feels obvious that we could do so much better, and that we're falling short of the dream. Please don't let me lead you entirely astray, it's fun for like a second, but perhaps just as a gimmicky new technology, it simply doesn't work well enough- it's like if a car could only drive 25 miles before it sputtered out or responded incorrectly to your turning of the steering wheel. Definitely not worth the price overall though- shame on Oprah for pushing this product on me, which is owned by Zuckerberg, and was sold by Bezos.

Well the gaming is fun as long as it works and you don't need assistance. Google ""reset unlocking pattern"" and you will find many have been locked out of their oculus.

this vr system is great yes it has some flaws like first the strap can be discomforting after some time but with some paddijg it makes it better also with people that have a big nose or smaller face the lenses tend to fog up and that will be annoying the speakers are pretty good and it will take some time to get the sweet spot on the lenses so you can see clearly. once you have it it's a great out of this world experience but before you buy read this many people don't talk about how you feel. well the first day using it you may feel kinda off or dizzy that will go away with sleep but after the first thru the 5th day some people will feel like sh*t it can make you get a headache and stomach ache and make you dizzy and delayed all day that just because it is throwing off your equalimbrium once you get used to it you will be fine with no problem but this very cheep and good VR is great and definitely recommend

Great quality. Great games. Completely worth it.A few problems I’d like to address (for other customers, people reading the reviews…):- A lot of people are complaining about a Facebook account being required. You’ll spend hundreds of dollars on a headset, and you complain that you need to create a free account? Just do it, dude.- A while ago, I had an issue where the tracking kept making me redraw the boundary. I saw a comment about this. Simply hard restart (not just turn off) the headset, and it’ll be fixed.- Some people say that it is blurry/low quality. Adjust your headset so it’s tighter on your head and adjust the eye things on the headset (by pushing to the left or right, depending on the positioning of your eyes) and it should be alright. It’s great quality, usually.

Game play is pretty cool and some of the VR worlds are pretty amazing but all that is shadowed by its need to link with facebook now meta accounts. If the privacy part of that isn't an issue which it wasn't so much for me its the high probability you may get stuck in a login loop as it tries to link your Facebook account to the oculus account. This by the way is not an option it requires it. Definitly Google the Oculus Quest 2 login loop of death. After 4 different tech support failures I was left to the forum world to assist.

Got the Quest 2 for my son. Got all the bells and whistles, including the different mask sizes, the extended battery, protective case, etc. worked great for the first couple of months then froze. Returned it after researching and finding that this was a known issue.  Waited about four months for FB to send a refurbished unit. That one worked for less than a month before the fan went out and it stopped working. Returned it again and here I am thirteen months into ownership with only three months of functional unit time. Got an email a few weeks ago saying that they are sending the replacement unit. Still waiting and not holding my breath. I guess rushing to make the cheapest VR headset means cutting some corners.

Honestly, I bought my Quest 2 off of a limb, I wanted the PS5 but at the time it was hard to acquire so I ended up impulse buying a Quest 2, I do not regret it one bit! I think one thing that I overlooked was that you have to try to fit the glasses in the Quest 2, which is difficult for me because I wear a large frame, or wear contacts. Initially, I used contact lenses to see while using the Quest 2 but after a while it bothered me that I always had to put my contacts on every time I wanted to play because I don't like wearing contacts. One day I was doing some google searches for an alternative and VR WAVE was there to answer my questions! I sent in my prescription for VR WAVE lenses and I have been playing nonstop since! They give you a whole kit to test the blue light through the lenses they send, a card with your prescription on it so you know its your pair, a case for safe traveling, and lens cleaners. They were as much as regular glasses and I don't regret the purchase.

You would think they would be better at this point with customer satisfaction but everytime I do what they ask and it fails the come up with more things to try, really video record the problem by looking into the eye port so they can verify the same thing day after day. Why? Most likely won’t get anything else from Facebook after this.

I see a lot of people complaining about not being able to play all the VR games out there. Well you can. Add a VR capable PC and plug in and play. There are also a few apps out there you can put on your PC or Android phone, hook up the link cable, create a free oculus developer account, enable developer mode on oculus headset and play 10000s of games.

I bought the oculus quest 2 so excited and when I got it, it was the best thing ever really it was. For 2 whole weeks, I loved the thing, the content, the structure of it, it was all great and then it started crashing, then it started kicking me out of games, then it started not letting me start the games. After about a week I contacted oculus support, they are absolutely horrible. They take forever to respond. I finally got someone to start a replacement order. He send he started the replacement order on Jan 26. and I didn’t get another email until Feb 4. and get this there still processing the replacement request. So to sum it up, I wouldn’t say don’t buy a Oculus if you really want one, but just consider the risk of getting one like mine and knowing that it will be a long long ride trying to get a new one

My right controller mysteriously stopped working after about a month or so. I did some research and found out that this happens to nearly every headset at some point, its a factory defect. This would be fine if Faceboo...Meta had replacements, which they don't, or a system in place to enable repairs in less than a month. When I called they literally told me ""we'll get back to you in a week"" lol. In many cases tech support appears to not even be calling or messaging people back. I can't use my headset, its an expensive paperweight. Sure, its cheap but be warned, this is almost guaranteed to be waste of money.

I bought this after my vive had been broken for years and I wish I had done sooner. I've had it for two weeks and I can hardly put it down. Airlink for pcvr games works amazingly well with no latency issues to be noticed (on a 5ghz network of course, dont expect wireless pcvr to work well with average wifi.)All in all it's amazing, but I had to give it 4 stars for the horrible IPD fitting and extremely narrow fov. I get a lot of eye strain reading text and it feels like I'm looking through scuba goggles. Ultimately these are very minor problems I have with the device.

Spend the money on a new age console instead. The simple fact that you need a Facebook account to even play games on it is ridiculous.

When I contacted support, they point to the FAQ where you can add 3 accounts.  I read this before I purchased but this is highly misleading.  You can add 3 accounts to device #1 or device #2.  You cannot add any accounts to device #3, without disabling app sharing on device #2.

It’s fun and good at first but after 2 months I noticed that there’s dead pixels, terrible tracking. Bad battery life, and a bad strap. I get headaches after playing for 1 hour. Speaking of using it for 1 hour that’s how long it lasts after a bit of using it. The controllers are good are comfortable. The strap and tracking are the worst. Also it gets very blurry sometimes. They need to work on things that will help the oculus rather than add things that make it “cooler”.

The hardware for the quest 2 is great. However, everything about the experience is ruined by the complete ineptitude of the software developers. Doing anything with the headset is an enormous pain due to the buggy, poorly thought out, and often inexplicably complicated interface. Even something as simple as changing a password requires a complete factory reset of the headset. I would recommend literally any other vr developer.

Headset is awesome, and the wireless experience is truly unbeatable but this headset is INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. The headset essentially has a miniature console plus screen attached to the front of it, only way to offset the weight is to strap and tighten it around your head with 50,000,000 newtons of force.

This is a great product and insanely fun. I have always played Xbox growing up and in my opinion this is the new way of gaming. This product literally makes you feel like you are in the game instead of seeing it on a TV or monitor. My only bad thing with this product is that you have to give your head and eyes time to get use to it. for the first few days my eyes felt heavy and I had a slight headache but as days went on I was able to adjust to it.

The occulus is an awesome machine and plays well and fits alright and really should be a great purchase. Except if you EVER have an account, billing, or game issue the company will do absolutely nothing to help you. I'm out almost 200 bucks because of it and will never give Occulus another dollar. Make sure you pick a company that actually cares about customer needs, cause Occulus sure won't.

Hate that my kids are REQUIRED to have a Facebook account to use this gaming system.Additionally, one of my son’s hand controllers stopped working and we have spent the last month getting the run around from customer service. There is NO WAY to reach them so they DO NOT honor their warranty. They just keep saying they are working on it. Horrible experience for an expensive system.

Parents, be aware. These are being used to traffic humans. The kids talk ""live"" to someone, thinking it's someone their age. A 23 year-old man coerced a 13 year old girl to meet him, took her out of state, and they found her in the back of a semi-truck in Utah. Please watch over your children!

I contacted oculus support and they asked for the serial numbers, which I provided. I also provided proof of purchase from amazon.

As long as you’re not a over analytical tech nerd (no offense) you’re going to love this thing. Anybody from kids to grown adults. It’s an absolutely vivid and immersive experience. However, if you’re easily prone to motion sickness, I advise stay away from games that make you move around to much and try out stationary games like “Physics Hand Lab”.

After reading so many FB comments *I barely go on FB* I convinced myself I would never be able to figure out how to get it to work when it arrives. Doom, Gloom and a lot of Zoom - if I couldn't figure this out by myself I was out a lot of money! By the way, has anyone else notice the huge price comarison of the Quest? Anywhere from $299 - $699 for the same Oculus Quest 2? Anyway, jus sayin...Today - It finally arrived and boy was I terrified opening the box. I stared, should I send it back - can I do this... well, a long time later I did it, I tore the plastic and out came my Oculus Quest 2 with two cool controllers.Within 15 minutes I was hooked up to WiFi, FB and playing tennis. I got tired and did meditation for 10 minutes just floating in space. The realty is - its plain awesome! It looked so real that I found myself suddenly afraid of heights!  Then it was time to charge the quest - which took around 2 hours.Yes, it was that easy!!! I love it! So, lesson to everyone - if I can do it all by MYSELF you can too - because you are awesome! Especially if you reading my review. Thanks!A quick note: You have the option to move the eye piece to make you vision clearer.  The eye piece does not rotate. You must take your thumbs and slide right or left.

This headset is amazing. The display is nice, it’s comfortable and overall is great for people new to VR. The only thing that really gets me is that you absolutely need to have a Facebook account to use it. (unless you plan on jailbreaking the system) It’s honestly kind of scary to me, knowing that so many social platforms are trying to get as much data on people as possible. Anyways, great headset. lol.

I have wanted one of these bad boys for a while. Finally they're back in stock, so I bought one. So far I like it and can tell I'll be using it a lot for games and... Other things.It came in simple minimalist corporate packaging like everything does these days, mostly paper (Yay Earth). It came undamaged, but I'm guessing whoever tested it slammed into a wall with wet paint because there's a blue scratch on one of the corners.Pros:Relatively AffordableGreat TrackingCan go Mobile if you wantCons:-Headstrap Sucks-3 Lens Settings, Couldn't get it quite right-Facebook now has a live 3D view of my disgusting room.It's pretty much good enough if you're like me and just want access to VR. I will update after further testing if anything important happens.

Update:For people who wear glasses. Please get a pair of insert prescription lens, it gives you a new VR world.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Things I like:All in one VR, you don’t need to do any cable connection, everything could be connected by WiFi. Oculus provide air link to your PC(still beta version),  so IT WORKS on YOUR STEAM ! But it may disconnect occasionally.Things I DON’T LIKE :(1), it takes time to wear because I have a glasses. So I need to put VR on, adjust my glass to a comfortable position until I can see clearly. My current glasses has large frame, which doesnt fit into the VR, so I have to use my old glass that has smaller frame to fit, which still make me feel super tight when I put VR on.(2), All in one device means the processor will generate heat. I don't think this device has cooling system. So if you play the game for a while, your head will feel hot and sweat.Overall, I still recommend it.

There will always be VR ""enthusiasts"" with boatloads of money that brag about their bleeding-edge VR headsets (like the Valve Index, which is over 3 times more expensive than this headset, AND requires a gaming-quality PC to boot). But, in terms of value, there is absolutely nothing better on the market than this headset.Even the previous 64GB iteration (for the same price) was still great value, so this updated version (which also addresses the facial irritations caused by the old face pads) is a no brainer. If you have even a HINT of curiosity about getting into the VR world, this is THE headset to get! You won't be disappointed!(Side Note: The ""mandatory"" Facebook integration, while a negative to some, is actually a good quality ""appstore"" interface, that's quite easy to log into and use with your existing Facebook account. Any digital storefront in the world requires some sort of ""account,"" but letting me use my own Facebook actually simplifies the process even further.)

Honestly, the best thing about this sort of VR is that there's no wires to deal with. Turn on, sign in with Facebook, and done.  Also, Beat Saber is pretty much the greatest thing ever. Just...yeah... Beat Saber is life.I know there's something to be said for ohnoes!, - Facebook has more data! Honestly, if they want to see me flail around in Beat Saber, knock yourself out, Facebook.I did pick up the Elite headband/battery/case, and that finishes off the package, but it's by no means necessary - just nice to have. Overall, loving this thing. Yes, the resolution could still be (a lot) better, but for convenience and fun - this is where it's at. We've come a long way from the PSVR days and the crazy setup process and cabling.Excellent stuff, - and great value in its new 128GB configuration. 4.5 out of 5.

More immersive sound and reactive responsiveness. Picture quality also much closer to high end.One star off for not making it abundantly clear that games from prior unit could not be retrieved directly from my already used by me Oculus account. It appears that you must upload to a PC first, then download to the Oculus 2. A direct from account download would have made so much more sense but likely would have raised the price point of $299 definitely the sweet spot for this unit.I truly could not decide if I should buy this (They double storage and kept it same price as it was during first release of the Quest-2.). For those who have asked if we're aware that the price for these units  runs from $299 on PRIME to  $699 (from some individual sellers), here's the deal. Originally released at $299 with 64GB storage. Then units were discontinued due to issue with head straps. Oculus team reworked the head straps but the units weren't available for awhile. So those who purchased them decided they would sell their remaining units for more than twice the Prime price w/o the extra storage. A lot of disgruntled users who apparently didn't stay current on the Oculus news of this item paid the $699 because they didn't realize same unit with more storage was being released by PRIME for the original $299. Oh well.

Amazing quality image, fluid response, truly a mind blowing experience. Super fast delivery too. So all good on the quality and supplier.BUT! Facebook locked my 16 year history account just days after registering my oculus quest 2, and I have no way of clearing this with facebook as no channels in place for this. Check Reddit - many many people in same position. I now have a useless $300 Oculus Quest 2 and wasted 100's of $$ on apps that I no longer have access to. TOTALLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT until Oculus stops the need to associate a facebook account.

I have always loved the idea of VR and I have tried it a handful of times through store kiosks and local arcades that have them. But I was never able to actually own one myself because I never had a PC powerful enough nor the room space to be able to use it effectively. But I recently got a new apartment that is huge and I finally scrapped the extra money together to buy the quest 2 and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I love that it does not require any cables to be able to use it when it is charged so the freedom inside the games feels even more immersive. I also love the picture quality, I was nervous at first seeing as how it is not using a PC to be it's graphical power source but I was wrong, it is gorgeous and I literally feel like I am in another world. I will also say for anyone concerned (I didn't give a crap at all btw), it was just announced yesterday that a Facebook account is no longer required to use this device, so if that was a deal breaker for you then you're in luck! So far I have played Superhot, VR-Chat, Arizona Sunshine, and Vader Immortal and they were all breathtaking experiences and I was in my glory the entire time. The controllers are super accurate and feel great to hold, every button is perfectly positioned on the controllers. I also found that the 128gb model is plenty of storage for how small most of the games are install size wise so I feel there is no need to spend an extra $100 on unneeded storage. One thing that may be an issue for some is the head-strap built onto the headset itself. I had heard from a few people that the (sold separately) strap extension is a MUST for people with even remotely bigger heads, I find as someone with a big head that the default head-strap is completely fine for me. Luckily I opted to take a risk and not buy the separate strap extension because it would have been a waste of money for me. You may want it if you wear glasses though which I do not. But, obviously no device is perfect so I will say what I do not like is how short the battery life is but I suppose it is a good thing because it forces you to give your eyes a break so it is what it is. All and all, I would highly recommend this device to everyone. It is amazing.

This is the virtual reality device I have been dreaming of since the mid 90s. I am primarily a PC gamer, so I wanted something that would work with my PC, and I was not all that interested in the standalone functionality. I was amazed at the quality of the standalone quest 2 games. The virtual environments are much more convincing than I expected. It really feels like you are IN these games. The controllers do a great job of mimicking real life hand use, and the haptic feedback can make it feel like you are actually touching/pressing things (example:  saving your game in Resident Evil 4 VR really feels like you are typing on an old mechanical typewriter). The first time I took the headset off, I had to spend several seconds processing the fact that my living room was indeed real. You can also use this to watch shows and movies, and even meet up with people this way. I delayed buying one for years because I was worried I would regret it, but instead it's better than I dared to hope.

Very pleased with the Quest 2 as a replacement for my Rift S. I primarily play DCS and MSFS and this headset works great. I purchased the Oculus link cable and with some tweaking I’m seeing excellent results. The clarity is significantly better than the Rift S although not as clear as the HP Reverb G2. But the ability to use a single cable for PC gaming and then go completely wireless for other games is awesome. The headstrap is sufficient and I didn’t feel like the headset was going to fly off my head. But I opted for the Elite headstrap for added comfort. This thing is incredibly comfortable for extended use. The adjustable IPD is fantastic and there seems to be a pretty large sweet spot.I have only two complaints. One is that there is a slight gap around your nose so you can see light. This is actually beneficial in DCS where you still need keyboard commands but it can be annoying. Secondly is that even while using the Link cable, your battery will die after about 1.5-2 hours. I have mine hooked up to the motherboard of my PC (Asus Rog Strix x570-e) and it doesn’t charge while gaming. That’s a bummer but you’re pushing a lot of data through that cable anyways.Overall I’m happy with the Quest 2. Going from a display port cable to a single USB-C was a big concern for me. But I still get excellent FPS. I can actually read cockpit instruments and labels without putting my face 2” from them like with the Rift S. This isn’t the best VR out there but for the price it’s hard to beat.

Headset 9/10My cousin had the first Oculus quest and when the second came out I wanted to get it. When I opened the shipping box the Oculus box was wrapped in bubble wrap which I liked and everything was clean and brand new. The shipping was crazy fast like 2 days. 1 day early. It came fully charged and ready to use. Took me a few minutes for the software update and the setup but after that everything was easy and simple. One thing I disliked was having to manually adjust the eyepieces and they don't go as far as the Quest 1. Another thing is the base strap. If at all possible get  a new head strap as the one it comes with has very little adjustments.Controllers 10/10The controllers feel amazing and they feel very immersive. Furthermore they are extremely comfortable and fit my hands well.Games 10/10There are many different games on the quest store with one for any play style. I personally downloaded Pavlov beta. If you are looking for a FREE immersive first person shooter (FPS) I recommend Pavlov. The guns look great and take actual skill to use. It's not like call of duty when you press a button to reload but you actually have to learn the weapons and how to operate it. But enough about Pavlov. The app library is easy to navigate and simple.In conclusion I recommend getting this %100

The oculus is great.  Amazing quality and vr for the price.  Only issue I have is that it should at least come with one game like beat saber.  But it includes no games at all. Just a tutorial.  In addition if you are female you must wear your hair down or in a really low ponytail because the mask strap goes straight back over your head leaving no room for a ponytail.  This sucks when you are doing workouts and sweating.  So sweatbands and some adjustments will be needed.  Otherwise it is a good product.

This is a total blast.  It's a good quality unit and I have no real issues with it.  It's so nice to not be tethered to anything.  That's a huge feature in my opinion.  Makes it completely portable.  The sound that comes out of it is actually better than I was expecting.  I've also plugged in earbuds when I need to for extra isolation and better bass.  It now comes with a silicone cover for the foam face cushion which is great since I guarantee you will get a bit sweaty wearing it over long periods so it's easy to wipe down.  I also bought (and highly recommend) getting their fancy headgear that has the extra battery built-in.  We play for a lot longer than I anticipated so doubling the battery life was well worth it.  I also got a chromecast to stream it to a tv which makes it fun to watch someone do it.

So Here goes :Pros :- It's cheaper than other VR I know about- It's pretty light- easy to setup- portable, you don't need a base or camera for it. It's already built in on the headsetCons :- You can easily got motion sickness if you not used to VR- Battery life is super short, like about 2 hours- It's pretty uncomfortable for people with glasses- absolutely need FB ACCOUNT << I literally need to make FB account for thisIt's all good for me, till I got motion sickness and vomiting my entire guts and almost destroying my bath sink. But well, NO REGRET! 8 out 10 will play VR again(For likely just 2 hrs cuz the Battery sucks).

I've wanted a VR setup for years, but was intimidated by the hardware requirements and the hefty entry cost. Enter the Oculus Quest 2, which delivers great quality standalone VR experiences at a fraction of the cost of other VR headsets (which also require you to have a high-end gaming computer). I've enjoyed every moment with this device and will continue to do so, no doubt about it.IPD being locked to three settings is definitely an issue that I can understand other reviewers being upset about. I lucked out by having my IPD exactly match the 3rd setting (68 mm). Make sure that your IPD is within the Quest 2's provided range before purchasing.To all of the people that are freaking out about needing a Facebook account in order to use this headset, there's a very easy solution: Create a Facebook account under a fake name using a junk email address (of which you should already have several). Use that Facebook account with the Quest 2. Done.

I bought this as part of my New Years resolution to move more and get into better shape, and it has certainly made it easy to reach my goals.As a woman closing in on my sixth decade, I don't feel comfortable going to a gym, so I needed something to keep me motivated at home.While the documentation that came with the Quest was sparse to the point I had to go to you-tube to figure out how to set it up, once I had it configured it was fun and easy to use.I need reading glasses, but found that I can use the headset without wearing them, and still get crisp visuals.I've been sticking to rhythm games like Beatsaber, Synth Riders, and OH-Shape to start with, since I do not want to commit to a subscription service that charges a monthly fee, and it has been easy to spend hours moving without realizing how much time has passed.Very happy with my purchase.

I have been buying console games since my daughter was 5, she's 32 now. I brought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and I had to try it. I go back to the days of the arcade and putting hundreds in quarters in the machines and the advent of Atari. I'm 65 now and in spite of my opinion of Mr FACEBOOK (Zuckerberg), the metaverse is coming and it reminds me of my excitement when I was waiting for ""The information highway""😏 This was a name that they called the ""Internet"" before it came to be. VR is going to be the next ""big thing"". The graphics will improve, the interface will be better and in twenty years, who knows what it's potential will be. I played Pong on Atari and was fascinated and just because I'm 65, doesn't mean that I have to lose my enthusiasm for science and the marvels of it's creations. I am going to buy a Oculus for myself and I will be seeing Mr FACEBOOK in the metaverse 👍

Quest 2 is the best thing to happen to VR gaming. It finally makes the hardware accessible for the average gamer.  No base stations, no high end gaming computers (unless you want), amazingly easy to use, and a selection of VR titles to satisfy any gamer.It is highly recommended that the strap that comes with the device be replaced with something that offers more rigidity.  This will improve your comfort and user experience quite a bit.  The device has about a 2 hour battery life, so a strap with a battery toward the rear will provide dual benefits.  The extra weight of the battery also helps counterbalance the front heaviness of the device.The two controllers each run on one AA battery which last a surprisingly long time, but I'd still recommend a battery pack for controllers or rechargeable batteries.Most people also find that replacing the foam facial interface with something third party increases comfort and blocks out the little bit of light that leaks in around the nose.There is a huge third party accessory market, so find customization options on Amazon is a breeze.Pair this guy with a capable gaming laptop and there are some very nice AAA games out for VR like Half Life, Fallout, Walking Dead, and a whole library of games available on steam.Great fun for the whole family, and not a cost prohibitive price for entry.  If you're on the fence, just do it.

 What can I say it's the future? I'll tell you one thing though I wouldn't have bought half the electrical devices I did this year if I knew then about this. I got a 60 inch and a 33 inch flat I bet tv that is now useless cause I can throw these on and I'm in a 200 seat movie theater meeting friends. The only dark shadow I see and it's a big one is it's ties to Facebook and how if you get banned from one your banned from both a scary aspect for conservatives like me who are always telling the truth I learned in army Intell work and have been flagged almost monthly and had everyone overturned because they know I'm right and smart ill quote my references and everthing. So it's almost enough to make me not want to buy it because of Facebook's war against the truth and conservitives. And if you think I'm paranoid ill send you a pick of my blocks on Facebook and what for once for, sharing a link advertised through Facebook itself about a new show on inc disccalked child killers and I shared the link with a friends saying looks like a good show Facebook banned me for 30 days. Luckily I was able to get a second opinion and get it overturned like the rest and the same thing is happening to a lot of people just look how few conservative groups there are left on groups and to be honest I think there really moderated by liberals for all the rules they have on posts which add to you just can't make posts on there group. So if your a real American who stands up for what they believe in on Facebook you might want to think twice about purchasing this. I'm just going to leave Facebook for good been taking to.kuch memory for a while now.

This VR headset is amazing, it is by far the best VR you can buy for the money! The build quality is very nice and solid, and the unit feels like it's high quality materials.Screen: The screen on the Oculus quest 2 is very nice and clear, it has a resolution of 1,832 by 1,900 per eye. It also has a 90Hz refresh rate.Quality: The unit itself is very well constructed and doesn't feel cheap at all. It has a nice weight to it, but is not so heavy as to feel clunky on the head. The controllers are built well and feel nice in the hands, they don't feel cheap and plastic like.Operating system: The Oculus quest 2 uses a Qualcomm 865 processor XR2 variant and it runs very smooth. I have not had any performance issues so far and the unit has not shown any signs of slow down or throttling.Apps and games: The Oculus quest 2 has a decent amount of content, they have quite a few games that are a lot of fun and they also have streaming apps so you can watch your favorite shows and movies on the headset in VR. I Love the rollercoaster game and the Star wars: Darth Vader game is worth the price alone.Overall, this is a worthy VR headset. It is at a great price point, it is of great build quality, it has fun games for the whole family and it is portable. I can't say enough about this VR headset, if you are on the fence about this headset, just get it already. You will love this VR headset and your family and happiness will thank you!

I had held off buying any VR headset because I never wanted to have a cable attached to the headset, and wireless lag was a real problem. The Quest 2 removes both of these concerns by having its own processor and running the applications directly on the device.This is one of those situations where I can say something stereotypical like ""if I could give this more than 5 stars, I would"". But in this case, it's no exaggeration. The device is so mazing it makes me rethink the criteria I use to evaluate other products for 5 star reviews. If 5 stars is perfect, then 5 star reviews should be more rare. But I'd still give this 5 stars.This device has literally changed my life. In the month I have had it, I have lost 10 lbs. due to the exercise apps, and have turned an episode of depression completely around. I am happier and healthier, and I can honestly attribute that to the purchase of the Oculus. I was not prepared for how completely VR tricks the brain. I am prone to seasonal depression, and going outside during dreary winter months is not really helpful. But my brain reacts to spending time in sunny VR environments just as it would to real summer days outside.Over the past 5 years or so, it has been harder and harder to motivate myself to exercise. Running on a treadmill or even jogging outside can feel like such a slog. But VR exercise is fun. So fun, in fact, that I have to force myself to take breaks so I don't hurt myself. It's a gamified workout that actually works. I've never enjoyed exercising more than this, not hiking, mountain biking, or any other type of activity.The device and software architecture, I feel, are spectacular. Some people with more experience with VR headsets have said the graphics are not as good on the Quest due to the mobile processor, and I am sure that is true. But for me, the graphics are fine and also kind of beside the point. The experience of the applications does not suffer due to the lack of PC-quality graphics, in my opinion. The level of immersion more than makes up for it. I am sure if I was already a PC-VR-gamer, I'd notice it more. But going from no VR to this, I am often stunned by the quality of the graphics and more-so by how little the graphic quality matters compared to the other parts of the experience. It's hard to explain.Since getting my Quest 2, I have gotten 8 other people to get them just by being honest about how it has changed my life, and letting them try a few basic apps. And they are all also loving the experience. I honestly cannot even believe they are able to sell these things for this price. If you are on the fence, just buy it. I promise you there will be no regrets.

After some research, I settled on getting the Quest 2 as a headset.  The successor of the Oculus Go (which itself was born from Samsung dropping their support of the Gear VR as far as I know), The Quest line is a standalone headset - that is, you can just put it on, turn on the unit, and go.  This is opposite of the other type of headset you'll hear referenced - a ""PCVR"" headset, which requires a computer to use - and happens to be the type of headset I wanted.But first, some more information on the headset - the Quest 2 has some impressive specs for it's price point.  Firstly, it has a 100 degree field of view.  A bit more restrictive than some other headsets, but from my experience, it works.  You can set one of three positions for spacing the eyepieces apart (push them together or pull them towards the edges of the headsets with your finger) - this depends on each individual's face structure.  The default FPS (refresh rate) is 72Hz, but you can set experimental refresh rates - just as a heads up - it may not be compatible with some software, and your battery life will absolutely decrease a bit quicker, but that's the tradeoff.  Lastly, unlike higher end units that use separate devices to track the unit, this headset - which lends itself to being standalone - has what is known as inside-out tracking.  This means the device itself uses the small cameras scattered around the headset to determine where you are, and how you are facing.  The only drawback is there should be sufficient lighting.  The good news, however is that these cameras use IR light - similar to how the Wiimotes used two infared lights to track movement - so if you purchase an inexpensive IR flood light, you can easily use this headset in a dark room.  As for why you might want to do this.... keep reading.Before I get onto my experience, let me also say this: the device, despite being standalone, supports being linked to your PC via a Wi-Fi connection or with a USB C to USB A cable, giving you a PCVR experience.  This is a really good perk, because not only is this cheaper than the Oculus Rift S, which is a PCVR headset, but it just so happens that Meta backed out of the PCVR space - so it's not like you can just buy the Rift S (and if you did, it's not like you can get support if something breaks - something that apparently was common with that headset), and it's oculink cable is incredibly expensive.  Once connected, the headset loads the Rift VR environment so you'll enjoy an experience not unlike the Rift S.Here's my experience with the headset:It's really solid.  Many complain about the Facebook link, but it is what it is.  If you're dead set against anything Facebook or Meta, don't use it.  If you're heavily anti-data selling, don't use it.If you couldn't care less because you barely use facebook, or if you already have a facebook account?  There's no real reason for you to not buy this if you want an affordable (and high quality) VR experience.  Is there better?  Absolutely.  Is there anything as cheap while providing an equivalent (or even mostly equivalent) experience?  No.Standalone mode runs a modified Android OS (then again, so does most anything these days that isn't a PC or Apple).  It works great.  It's butter smooth, and haven't had a single issue.  Games that are made for this mode might be a bit lower quality than a PCVR title, but you aren't using a high end GPU - you're using an android device.  Most games look good no matter what, and the loss in quality is probably not going to be noticeable unless you're eagle-eyed, or you just have a tendency to notice these things whether or not you want to (like I am... I hate it lol).Once you connect to the PC, the experience is mostly good.  As you're no longer on a closed system, you're at the will of your PC.  Is it an older system like mine, with a decent GPU, and a many-years old Intel Haswell i5 CPU?  You're going to have an experience that reflects that.  Sometimes I get stuttering.  Sometimes not.  I haven't tested Wifi streaming, but quality is spotty so I won't be testing it, just using the usb cable.  I've only used one (already reviewed it), but your mileage might vary depending on the quality of said cable.  Generally, it worked fine for me.  Any apps for the standalone headset that I've used (Beat Saber, VRChat primarily) definitely look a bit better on PC, as one would expect - those titles need to be optimized for the weaker hardware if you aren't running off of a PC).The controllers are really good, and are decent at detecting when you are touching a button or the thumbstick, and detecting when you actually press them.  The experience has been great.  They aren't Valve Index controllers, but this isn't a $1000+ headset.  This is a $300-$400 headset (depending on your bundle/capacity).Regarding my mention of how the device tracks movement/direction and the like... the reason I like using the headset in the dark, is due to the physical construction of the headset.  To accommodate for any head shape, there are some gaps where light can come in.  Depending on where you look within the headset, you can see outside of it - a bit.  It's honestly minimal and I often don't notice it, but times when my brain wants to focus on any little detail, turning off the lights allow me to only see what's in front of me - think of it as you're watching a movie at home with the lights out, but there's a light coming from a room nearby - sometimes you can ignore it, but it might distract you - this is what I deal with at times.  To sovle this, an IR flood light lets the camera still track the room without an issue, while you can enjoy the dark around you.All in all, if you're anti-Meta/anti-Facebook, this will be a terrible device and it'll be the worst thing ever.  If you can look at the device on it's own or don't care about being linked to Facebook, it's a rock solid VR headset, especially for it's price.  I'd love to see this broken out of the integration with Facebook, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.

I have been excited about Virtual Reality since the 1990s, when it was just a thing in science fiction books. I bought a Quest 2 headset a few months ago, and am SO glad I did!VR is just.... fun. The experiences are amazing, there are hundreds of games for every taste, and there really is nothing like it. Many people do enhance and expand their experience by linking to a PC, but I use Quest 2 standalone, and it's amazing.Quibbles about Facebook and ""The Metaverse"" notwithstanding, the Quest 2 is a great purchase. Play games, interact with friends and/or strangers, workout, watch movies, or just kick back and do something chill. It's all there. Super easy to set up and use.Note that for most games you will need a fair amount of clear floor space to play in. I have a space in my small house that's about 6' x 12', and it is on the verge of being too small for some of the more active games. But I make it work!There are continual software updates to the headset, and tons of new experiences and games coming out all the time. I have added a few accessories, like grips for the controllers and prescription lenses, and although the stock head-strap fits me pretty well, I may add another strap for enhanced stability and comfort. But really the Quest 2 headset arrives with everything you need to get up and running right out of the box, and a lot of games are free, or have free demos you can try out.Oddly, I hear from a LOT of parents who are buying Quest 2 for kids who are as young as 3 years old. To each their own, I guess, but I wouldn't do that. For one thing VR is not recommended for kids under 13 for developmental reasons, so as far as I know there are no parental controls built in, and a lot of the experiences and games are way too intense for kids. I would think the headsets would be too heavy for a kid anyway.All in all VR has been a game changer for me - literally. I have never regretted buying my Quest 2 headset.

This is my first VR since my Gear VR. Has come a long way since then. If you have a powerful PC, this also doubles as a PC VR for the better quality games like Half Life Alyx. The stock headstrap is not very comfortable but with an aftermarket Elite strap clone ($30) it.is amazing.I recommend getting a strap that supports a power bank, otherwise you will.only.have about an hour of playtime before charging.The 90hz native refresh rate and the experimental 120hz refresh rate really helps with motion sickness.Even though it's mostly plastic,, it seems durable and controller batteries last roughly a month with moderate use before replacing.The integrated speakers are plenty loud but lack depth so headphones or earbuds are suggested. The Quest II supports Bluetooth so a wired connection isn't required.This is super fun, but be warned, you need a good amount of space to get the most out of it.

There are big problems with making this VR headset work with a PC, I recommend you do a quick netsearch before purchasing.Edit: it took a couple days to wade through Oculus tech support.  The problem was on my end, obscure, and of my own creation (interesting system config over here) so I can't in good faith say this is a bad product.  The mandatory Facebook login DOES add unneeded complexity, and it will be a problem for some.  Bear in mind tech support is a touch slow but they were very thorough and patient and the headset is probably worth it.So, I award five stars for a 4.5 star headset because I was previously one star mad because of my own impatience.

I like this unit. I wasn't the one that did all the research for which VR to buy, that grunt work all came from my son-in-law. He did a GREAT job recommending this to us. I like the games and the experience is great (so real I discovered I get motion/car sickness). I took a star off because of the fit. No matter what I do, no matter the adjustments I try to make, the headset must sit low on my nose in order to get a perfect picture. It makes it harder to breath.

After adjusting Inter Ocular Pupillary distance countless times, the View remained consistanly Blurry and with Low Resolution. After writing operating Instructions for the most simple and most complex Analog and Digital Devices as an Engineer for many years, I've concluded the Oculus 2 takes the Booby prize as the WORST INSTRUCTIONS EVER FOR BOTH THE MAIN DEVICE AND ITS CONTROLS!!!! By forcing the buyer to open a Facebook Account whether they want to or not, and purchase overpriced Content, IMHO the company will fail in both their obvious intentions of  inducting new customers into its clutches and create the obscene profits their Content demands.

First off the idea behind the oculus is awesome. It gives a cool VR experience. However, the picture clarity is just ehh. With 4K, qled, plasma TVs I would have expected more from this device especially for the price! On top of it all the games with good reviews are $30 + dollars a piece and you can’t even demo them before purchasing. The first game I purchased was onward and it was fun but because the clarity was ehh and the picture was fuzzy I kept getting dizzy and I don’t easily get motion sickness. This device is just a 360 view Wii device. I don’t believe this should cost as much or the games should be free.

This IS a much much better HMD, not only in the quality of games available, but the magnitude of the optics is far superior so if you are interested in viewing VR180/360 or 3D videos, this is the HMD to get ATM.

Works with VR on Steam, works well by itself.I'm giving three stars because they require me to have the app on my computer to play non oculus games. Then they sell me games on the computer oculus app. But none of those games you buy on the computer app can be installed on the headset. You're going to have as many as three separate and uninterchangable oculus libraries

Love this VR. I have owned the PSVR for years and this blows it away. It’s comfortable the wear and not too heavy. I love not being attacked by a cord to a console. The graphics are amazing. I love the ability to draw your play area and also switch between standing and sitting depending on what you are playing. Games can be a little expensive but you get what you pay for. Wish I would have bought this sooner.

I am a senior woman so not killing zombies, but tons of adventure non the less.  I love the fitness program Supernatural, the travel program Wander seen so many beautiful areas can not afford to go to. Love the games moss and other escape room types and the social areas. Also love mini golf and the table tennis. Love the movie watching of my Amazon movies in the VR theater.  Tons of fun. Anxious to start exploring the new updates with office too. I bought cute accessories for mine here on Amazon of skin, purple and head piece made it mine but it also protects it from finger oils and more comfy.

By far the Quest 2 is the best overall VR headset and it's popularity on Steam proves it. There may be other HMD's that do one thing better but nothing on the market right now does everything as well as the Quest 2 does, plus it's entirely wireless. You can use it as a standalone wireless VR headset and have a blast. Or you can connect it to a PC and play PC VR games with better resolution. it will take a few accessories to unlock it's full potential (like a new headstrap and a link cable) but nothing is more versatile.HOWEVER and this needs to be said. it requires a Facebook account to function. Some people will find that to be a deal breaker.

My 8yo son saved up his money to buy this and loves it.  There's a couple down sides from a mom standpoint.  He can't see when he's wearing it and is hitting walls, oven, baby brother etc. No matter what room we put him in he's running into stuff.  It could be that he's overly active while playing it.  Also, he's allergic to something on the headset itself that touches the face so the majority of his face is broke out in a rash. We put the silicon cover on it to protect his face and it doesn't fit very well,almost like it was stretched out  Otherwise he loves it. For the price it would be great to get some kind of basic carrying case for it as well.

I'm a console gamer. VR gaming won't ever change that, but I do quite enjoy 'exploring' in VR,  whether it's games like Myst (I still have my Sega Saturn version from 1995 though), or tours of VR cities/environments. I adapted to VR pretty quickly; I haven't experienced motion sickness, and my eyes don't feel strained after playing for a prolonged period of time. I'm disappointed there are only 3 ""locked in"" settings for the lens width though, as odds are one of the three are ""close"" to what you need, instead of being exactly what you need (per your IPD).

My son saved up to get him a VR set for gaming, he’s 14… We bought this, because apparently he didn’t do enough research to realize it does not work for PlayStation’s. Other than that looks really awesome, the packaging was amazing, they lost the first one, immediately gave us a refund, sent the next one out. We sent it back once we discovered that it does not work for the PlayStation and they gave us a refund.

Got this for the family to play. Easy to set up and had a few free options to get started. The head strap stinks, first thing I’m getting is a better one. Also got some grips coming. But the game play itself was super fun for ages 5,9,11,12,19,41,55. The controllers are to big for my 5 year old to hold and press the buttons at the same time so hopefully the grips will help, but everyone else took right to it.

Just the free apps already provide an immense amount of content to explore and experience.  Be careful as you get started as maintaining balance can sometimes be an issue (especially when first experiencing Jurassic park movies). Make sure to read the instructions about nausea, my only experience with is was when I got the walking dead, but there are work-around, and you can get used to it.

Finally VR is available at an acceptable price for me. This VR headset is truly a versatile device.  From playing games to watching moves and even educational experiences, I've used this every day and I'm enjoying it immensely.  I'm getting more exercise than I have in a long while since many of the games require vigorous movement to play them well.  I suggest getting some accessories to improve comfort and durability including the following:  A pad for the headband, silicone grip covers, and blue light filtering lens covers.  My first one had a defective controller so I returned it for a replacement. Still it gets 5 stars for the awesomeness.

This is a great vr system to get if you don’t wanna spend 800 plus for the high end vr systems. It does everything it more expensive competition does at a fraction of the cost. You can play it’s games wireless or hook it up to your pc to play the more demanding vr games. Battery life is ok but would recommend purchasing a battery with it. This is the Swiss Army knife of vr systems. They also allow you to share game purchases with other quests in your household. Overall love it only draw back is battery life is about 2hours.

Once you put all of the upgrades onto the Quest 1 it is pretty heavy. Using similar upgrades (headband, facial vent, plastic cover) the Quest 2 still feels significantly lighter than the Quest 1.In the Oculus app on PC you can unlock the highest res and use that for computer games and steam. Using that res compared to the stock res on the Quest is an incredible difference.If you are familiar with the Quest - moving to the Quest 2 controllers instantly feels ""right"". The button placement is much better

I was worried about how long my kids would stay interested in this because no matter what I buy they always go back to the consoles but this has been a hit. Someone in our family plays it everyday including the adults. I really wish it had more games but Beat Saber is my favorite and my youngest loves Echo. I highly recommend this. It's absolutely worth the price. I would buy a more comfortable head strap and rubber face mask though because the ones it comes with aren't incredibly comfortable after a while.

Must admit I was very apprehensive to buy this and made sure it had the free return possibility. That said, I am happy with the purchase and must admit a bit amazed. I have never really spent much time with video games simply as I just didn't personally find them interesting. There is much more to enjoy with the Oculus product and indeed I have found a couple of interesting games as well. The immersive video is great and being able to link to street view in the Wander app is fascinating.I agree with many of the points in reviews that found critical elements. The straps are definitely a bit cumbersome and I really have some second thoughts about any link to facebook as indeed is required here. I am sure there is more than meets the eye (VR or otherwise) with the facebook connection.All in all I am happy with the purchase and glad I bought the unit. They have kept the price good for what I think you get and there seems a decent variety of experiences available with the unit.

I have to say that I have used VR before this in VR arcades, but it is truly a different experience when you have it yourself.1. It was comfortable, the silicone rubber and the faux leather material are very nice, it does get irritating after 40~ mins. The weight is minimal compared to the Valve Index and HTC Vive so that is very nice, and no, wires!2. The strap, sometimes uncomfortable after a little while but it offers just enough support for me not to go out right away and buy a different strap. The adjustment on the back is very annoying but I got used to it, top adjustment is very nice. I might buy a third party strap like the bobovr one3. The graphics were amazing, I could barely see any pixels and the resolution and 120 Hz is very nice, my only problem with it is how my perephial vision is excessively blurry, there is not enough persice lense adjustment for the diverse human species. Overall very nice but not flawless4. Audio, nothing much to say, standard surround sound, crisp audio without that much bass. About the same if not a bit better than internal TV speakers.5. Controls were easy to use after learning how to use them for 30 minutes, nothing else to say6. There were a few good free games on the store, many of the nice beta games are not listed unless you search specifically for them. A lot of the good games are over 20$ which for some of the games I might say is a bit overpriced, like Population One, which I don't think qualifies as a game worth 25$, more like >207. In conclusion this VR headset competes with other headsets verywell, expecially in the price to performance area, wish it had better cooling and whatnot, but overall it was very great. My PC only runs on a 1050 Ti so I could not run Air Link stably. Hope to be able to buy more games on the Quest 2 (Lookin at you Oculus)

Bought this for a birthday present for my 11-year-old, and quickly things turned from excitement to frustration, as I was not able to connect it to my PayPal account in order to purchase games, partly due to a confusing registration process for someone like me that doesn't have a Facebook account. Issue was eventually resolved, but I find the whole process way too complicated. BTW, the technology is a lot of fun!

My favorite part about this item, is that I can control it from my phone. So when my daughter plays it, I can see who's talking to her during the games, control how long she can play on it, and what games get downloaded on it, and what can be purchased.We love the new experiences on it and I have been using some of the workout games on there. It has been really nice to think I'm outside, when it's been actually -5 out.Highly recommend it to others!

I've wanted a VR for a long time, and when I saw the price of the Quest 2 I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't be able to run my wishlist Steam games. After setting it up and logging in through Facebook (which I was also pretty nervous about), Oculus Link AND Airlink worked flawlessly for me, and I was playing Beat Saber within an hour. Very happy with this purchase!My only complaint is the price of the official cable, $79 is ridiculous. I ended up buying a Type A to Type C cable for less than half the price that works perfectly with Oculus Link.

I would wait awhile and save your money for three reasons.1.) Wait for the tech to improve. Initially the Oculus 2 is very impressive but the fun wears off quickly. The unit itself (without looking up specs) seems to be not much more powerful than a cellphone. Wait for a more powerful unit.2.) Wait for app developers to catch up. Some apps are fun for an hour or three but there really isn’t that many fun, well-developed games available yet. It’s mostly walking around an environment and graphics are about equal to an Xbox 360. Besides “watching 360 videos……….” there really aren’t many fun games so wait for developers to make some more content for the platform.3.) Tech support is very disappointing. The comfort of the head strap that comes with it not very good. So I paid close to $100 for Oculus’s Quest 2 Elite Strap. That strap is a much better design but made of a bad plastic concoction that is brittle and many people (view the listing) are having their straps break, including me. It didn’t last a year and I’m a grown man, I take very good care of the unit (I keep it in a padded gun case) and I don’t use it very often. I currently have 13 emails with tech support about it and still don’t have a head strap replacement. They ask for a LOT of information on the support ticket (I.e. pics, serial number, proof of purchase) and if you have a life and don’t respond almost immediately they try to close the ticket. It’s been 13 emails and 20 days and I still haven’t even gotten an “OK we’ll send you a new one”. For a company that should be big enough, they don’t have it together very well.Hopefully in the future this will change. It’s a cool idea but it’s just not there yet and in my opinion after a year with it, it wasn’t worth the money. Not by a long shot.

I'll start with why I 2 starred this, aka CHECK YOUR IPD BEFORE YOU BUY:The terrible: The IPD, (Inter-pupillary distance for those uninitiated) is the distance between your two eyes. The quest 1, valve index, and even mobile VR headsets like gear VR figured out, we're all a little different and need a minute adjustment.Quest 2? Three general, these will probably work for most of you slider settings. If you are dead in between those adjustments, they will not work and you will be met with severe pain in your eyes after 20-30 minutes of gaming. CHECK YOUR IPD BEFORE YOU BUY. My IPD is just over 65, which means I'm dead center between the 2-3 settings and get severe headaches. There needs to be a warning label on the damn thing about this, and there is not.The positive?: This is excellent quality for a budget headset. It's one panel, like a mobile VR headset, but it feels pretty good, even the default strap is pretty comfy. Oculus already had a good set of titles when FB/Meta bought them so you can play good games even if the newer ones that FB/Meta is making are crappy cash grabs in most cases.The bad: It feels cheap, the cameras detrack if you swing your arm too wide, or you look left and reach right like when playing beatsaber. It could be better, but for the price a little bit of learning to tilt head toward wide arm reaches, really isn't terrible.

There was no such option as 128 GB when I was preordering it. And a year later, this guys release 128GB version for same $299!I feel like I was scammed.Also the OS is extremely buggy, like I'm using nightly built beta releases.Guardian is kinda annoying. Too distracting.

The headset works great for being as cheap as it seems, having it plugged into a computer it sadly does faster then I retains power, the quolity also isn't the best and then the obvious tracking issues it has, it conflicts with steam a lot as well because of it being third party software sadly and Facebook just isn't a good company to have to deal with... Other then that it's a great headset to start your VR experience

The gaming experience is good and I enjoy using it. Only downside is that the straps are somewhat uncomfortable, especially worn after an extended period. It may also not work well for people wearing glasses. Otherwise it's a good VR headset for the bucks.

This was not a good experience. From the get go, the setup process was tedious and annoying. When done with the setup, it was time to try it out and adjust. I adjusted and adjusted and adjusted and ... you get the point. No matter what setting I used for the lens (1, 2, 3) the view was blurry. I  wear glasses, but I tried the glasses' extender just to see if that would work - nope - worse. My gut says I got a faulty product since so many good reviews, but in my case the experience was such a bummer I don't want anything to do with the product other than return it.

The quality of the video even in 4k seems blurred, but it is worth the money for what it does, however the customer service is horrible, when you have issues with a facebook account, they lock it in with the account so that you can only deal with facebook who has no customer service.  It will fustreate the heck out of you.

Fyi.... you do need a Facebook account.UPDATE: ever since occulus went to quest.. the updates bricked the headset. i have no games, factory resetted the unit and everything possible down to upgrading my pc to no avail... i only use the steam game vr system nothing more.... i used to like it before the updates hit it and now... its just a expensive paperweight now. congrats facebook for losing another customer. even customer service was absolutely no help. spend your money else were for a better product with better features.

I have a oculus Go and love it . So when this one came out I splurged and bought me one for Christmas .  I have yet to finish one game or App .  I’ve tried everything I’ve read on line on how to correct this .  Also the games I had free on my Go , for this oculus , the same ones are anywhere from $19 to 49 and that is ridiculous . I will be returning this . For this price, you shouldn’t have to research how to make the visual clear enough to see what the game or app is about .  I tried adjusting the eyepiece but it did not help . I have read that you can connect to your PC and adjust other settings to try and improve the clarity but who wants to pay over $400 and then spend time trying to adjust it so you can actually play a game or experience a roller coaster ride ?  I’ll stick with my Oculus Go and return this .

Honestly I'm a pretty experienced VR user, I've had a desktop HMD for a few years now. I thought it'd be silly to buy a standalone since PC tethered VR is supposed to be so much better. However I bought this on a whim this Black Friday and it's incredible1) No cable tripping you up, it sounds incredibly minor but not having a cable that you can feel getting caught on your back or your feet really helps you feel more immersed.2) Home Theater anywhere- the Quest 2 has a crisp enough display that you can lay in your bed with an gigantic virtual screen directly infront of you, I use it to watch incredibly dumb youtube videos in a cinematic environment.3) You can tether it to your PC via WiFi, meaning that you can play PC exclusive games like Half Life: Alyx, or even games that are on the quest but on the PC at a higher resolution. You literally get the best of both worlds, no cable in the way with a high frame rate and  fantastic visual fidelity.Overall,  this headset is incredible for beginners, you can strap this on anyone's head and they'll have fun, but even if you already have a Vive or a Samsung Odyssey, this is a crazy good upgrade.

El visor es muy bueno para lo que cuesta. El precio real debería rondar entre 6000-6200 pesos. Sin embargo, para ser un precio mexicano se me hace entendible por la tarifa de importación.Ahora sí viene lo bueno: La experiencia. Es un visor de realidad virtual que demuestra calidad desde el unboxing, tal vez lo único criticable desde mi perspectiva sería la banda de la cabeza, pero se entiende totalmente porque oculus vende la correa elite por separado. La banda de cabeza no es incómoda, simplemente no va de acuerdo a la calidad percibida del producto en general, simplemente si puedes comprar la elite o una genérica, entonces sería lo mejor que puedes hacer.La experiencia de juegos es simplemente irreal, sumamente inmersivo y si le sumas el hecho de que puedes vincularla directamente a tu pc entonces se vuelve un game changer (si tienes una computadora que pueda correr los juegos). No considero necesario usarlo con un PCVR, pero se agradece demasiado poder hacerlo con un router casero con apenas 3-8 ms de latencia desde una habitación diferente conectado a la red de 2.5ghz. Si quieres desconectarte un par de horas del mundo (porque eso es lo que en promedio dura su batería) y pasar un buen rato, esta es la opción a tomar. Respecto a la batería, aunque pueda parecer algo escasa, es suficiente si tomamos en cuenta la necesidad de descansar los ojos, de todos modos si requieres más tiempo puedes conectarte directamente al pc adquiriendo cualquier cable usb 3.2 a usb c o a un powerbank de diversas capacidades para alargar tus sesiones de VR.Si esperas una calidad visual cercana a la que tenemos en el mundo real, entonces te recomiendo que inviertas en visores del doble o triple de precio, pero por este precio considero competente la percepción de los objetos renderizados por el visor por sí mismo y vía PC es sobresaliente, pero con puntos a destacar como lo son el texto que por lo que entiendo en casi cualquier visor de uso no profesional suelen notarse algo borrososos en algunos ángulos de visión, pero es cuestión de explorar y encontrar los puntos de enfoque de la visión para poder leer sin mayor esfuerzo texto en esta plataforma. Satisfecho 100% con esta compra.Edit: Desafortunadamente a la semana y media de uso murieron un par de pixeles justo en el centro, por lo que opté por devolverlo para posteriormente pedir otro que no tenga este defecto, así que por esto cambio mi calificación de 5 a 4 estrellas.

 No me quedaba claro lo que había que hacer con él, ya en mis manos, pues tuve que aprender y decidí no gastar en el cable oficial que cuesta casi un 20% de lo que vale el aparato, invertí en un Router 6g, que instalé como en 15 minutos con todo y configuración.  Ahora puedo jugar lo que he comprado desde mi computadora en cualquier parte de la casa, sin cables, excepto el de la batería extra.  La tienda Oficial Oculus tiene costos de casi el doble, así que hago una wishlist en Steam y conforme me van avisando que están en descuento, lo voy aprovechando.Hay que hacer gastos extras si eres jugador de hueso colorado, como yo.  Hay que invertir en una correa que balancee el peso del equipo, también que tenga para sostener una batería extra porque a mí no me alcanza el tiempo que da la batería inicial.  También voy a invertir en una careta y en unos lentes anti luz azul y antirreflejantes.Lo que debo decir... Es que absolutamente vale la inversión, la Realidad Virtual tiene una cantidad de Experiencias Immersivas que no sabrás por dónde empezar y qué probar después.Pero absolutamente vale cada centavo.  Me arrepiento de dudar entre comprar éste o el PS5 por tanto tiempo.  Aquí no nado en dinero, así que la duda estaba justificada.

Primeramente, el visor es de lo mejor qué hay en el mercado CONSIDERANDO el precio; un valve index es MUY caro, pero tiene adiciones qué el Quest 2 no y viceversa; eso es lo que lo hace un gran visor a comparación de los de tope de gama.Si tienes planeado usarlo para jugar en tu computadora:1) Necesitas una GPU y CPU capaces de correr realidad virtual.2) Requieres de un cable adicional cómo el Oculus Link, SIN EMBARGO, existen cables genéricos cómo alternativas, que son mejores, y más largos.2.1) Si vas a comprar un cable genérico, asegurate de qué sea:USB-C 3.1 a USB-C 3.1 ó USB-A 3.1 a USB C; estos cables rondan entre los 490-780 pesos mexicanos por el simple hecho de ser 3.1, ES OBLIGATORIO que sean 3.1 y no 2.0, porque de lo contrario vas a gastar de más al darte cuenta que vas a tener un rendimiento pobre, no gastes 200 o 300 mxn para después gastar otros 500 mxn.3) Una nueva correa o headstrap; sí, las reseñas eran ciertas; el headstrap o correa que viene por defecto es un dolor de cabeza (literalmente) es un mal diseño ya que no distribuye de forma homogénea el peso del viso sobre tu cabeza y por ende se vuelve incómodo a la larga.Yo compre el BOBOVR M2 y es una maravilla, tomando casi el diseño del Rift s, el soporte que te da en el occipital y la facilidad de ajustarlo lo hacen un aditamento indispensable.Y eso es todo lo que yo considero necesario para poder disfrutar el visor al máximo.Edit: RECOMIENDO USAR OCULUS LINK, SI EL CABLE ALTERNATIVO LES LLEGA A FALLAR, YA NO COMPREN DE ESE TIPO, VAYANSE A LA SEGURA Y USEN EL ORIGINAL, AUNQUE SEA MÁS CARO.

Awesome experience with the new updated 128 gb version, i am still trying out new games but until now it has been a very good experience. Both my daughters 6 and 3 year old are enjoying it as well.First things first, you do not need a PC to use this VR headset, however if your an advanced gamer then you probably have a gaming pc that might work with PCVR games, others please check the minimum requirement before you buy a PC for PCVR gaming.Again note with this Quest 2 you do not need a PC it works standalone and you only need a good internet connection, you can buy or get free games from Oculus store or Sidequest, tons of video on youtube on how to use sidequest so check it out. Also you can install youtube and Netflix and use it to watch 360 videos and 3d  movies.Some complain of blurriness, so note you have to adjust the straps so that you are looking straight into it, everything in your periphery will be blur so adjust everytime you wear it, it should be sticking to your face tightly.If you have glasses then they need to be small as my computer glasses did not fit but i think you will have some problems when using it with glasses.Finally it absolutely fun to play with these, if you get it under 40 k for 128 GB then its a good deal in India , i tried shipping it out from US to India but the order was not completed as they do not ship things with battery so anyways buy it from here in India and it will be delivered the next day.

The best value for money standalone VR headset.Dont go for the negative review that it has bad lense or is cheap bla bla bla, cause you cant even find any VR standalone headset at this price.1. Quality is great, even if you drop it it wont break easily and still works, check out ThrillSeeker channel on youtube for more strees test that guy did.2. Lenses are old once, yes they are but in this segment they wont dissapoint you compared to $1000 Valve Index3. Resolution and FOV is good but not great but perfect for movies and watching 3d movies, 360 movies and Oculus games for sure. Casual user wont even find any difference4. Great library of games, litttle expensive but you get sales now and then and you have sidequest if you want more for free and also with some tricks you can install any android apps.5. The glimps and your start to metaverse6. Battery is a concern but get the cable creation cable and you are goog to go. Get the 16ft one7. Install Sidequest. (Mobile and PC) if you want a lot of best and free content and if you are a advanced PC user. Not recommended for users not fimiliar with advance PC use or adb, but you get a tons of tutorial on youtube if you want to try.8. If you have a good PC, VR ready GPU, then this can play Steam VR as well, now it has Airlink wireless as well, but you need Wifi6, 5ghz band and PC connected using ethernet for best quality.9. Amazing hand tracking and controllers at this range10. In any case you end up scratching the lenses, get a polywatch solution and see the magic, it would be as good as new, thank me later for that advice. See youtube for more info11. Great mutiplayer capabilities, mic is great and stock speaker are just awesome, and you can still connect your own headsets as well.12. Get a rechargable battery for your controller, cost around rs400 with batgery and its charger.13. If you still have more money get an Elite strap for best comfort and wobble free experience.14. If you sweat much, mind that you might see fog on lense on prolong use, there are tons of alrernatives to try to avoid that, but the cheapest option is simply put a tissue to your forehead and put on the headset and good to go.15. You are still here that means you are convinced, just go for it and buy it, you will not regret for sure. Search me in case you need more assistance on Oculus,  Ashura- is my Oculus id.

Produto maravilhoso, funciona perfeitamente, é MUITO divertido com toda certeza... O único problema é que tive um problema com o controle esquerdo... Como uso muito em games de tiro, utilizo o analógico do controle esquerdo com frequência, e acho que consequentemente ele começou a dar problema... De vez em quando ele fica mexendo sozinho o analógico pra baixo. Tentei entrar com o suporte da loja para poder trocar o controle, uma vez que faz aprox. 1 mês que estou com o produto, e na ""elegibilidade de devolução/troca"" está dizendo que faz 3 dias que venceu meu prazo para troca do produto e 2 dias para a devolução do mesmo. Mandei mensagem para a loja faz um tempo fazendo tal reclamação, porém não me responderam e agora perdi o prazo de troca/devolução.De qualquer maneira, o produto é maravilhoso, funciona perfeitamente (tirando o problema do controle que acho que foi mais má sorte minha mesmo, já que meus amigos que também tem, nunca tiveram esse problema), e minha reclamação fica apenas com o compromisso da loja com o cliente. Agora não sei como  posso arrumar o controle. E aqui onde moro não possui assistência técnica para isso... PRODUTO: Nota 9,5; Entrega: NOTA 9; VENDEDOR: 5.

Ghosting effect, image at corner of the lens  blurry, all good games are paid in range of Rs 1500-2500 which are very costly seeing the quality.After spending 35k, you need to spend 4-5k for storage and its scratch protection films which are mot easily available.Build Quality is great but color is white due to which it easily catches dust and scratches. Just good for 1 day experience.Overall, not price worth for given graphics, VR quality and performance.Logical to purchase after 2-3years if any worthy PC games are ported and price of available games are reduced.

La verdad que he probado por primera vez las VR y puedo decir que es bastante asombroso hay mucho que se puede hacer utilizando directamente las quest 2 o conectándolas a las pc, puedo decir que es bastante practica, los controles son muy inmersos y cómodos en su totalidad, por otro lado tienes funciones como usar los dedos de las manos como mando gracias a las cámaras de la parte de abajo para controlar las quest 2, compatible también si lo usas en pc. Puedo decir que tiene bastantes accesorios que hacen que el Quest 2 sea aun mas cómodo.Igualmente vi un par de observaciones y me atrevo a responderlas.Lo de la distancia de los ojos, cuenta solo con tres modos y puedo decir que directamente puede ser conflictivo para persona que se encuentran fuera del rango que tiene, por lo que he visto en otros videos sobre su antecesor este no tenia el problema por que se ajustaba un poco mas libre.Vista ligeramente borrosa esto si lo puedo confirmar pero igual no es algo que sea tan grave ya que al estar jugando no lo notas.La duración de la autonomía.A esto si pude notar que dura solo 2 horas, pero pues tengamos en cuenta el por que teniendo lo del seguimiento de los mandos las 4 cámaras que tiene en funcionamiento en todo momento para la inmersión en vr, una pantalla que casi da 2k a 120hz y una potencia que considero muy buena pues hace que todo esto se gaste rápido.¿Como lo soluciono? Pues solo compra una PowerBank ya sea de 10000 MaH o 20000, con eso te dará suficiente para jugar durante unas 4 o 6 horas, al menos a mi me ha dado ese tiempo.Por otro lado la duración de la batería de los mandos es bastante larga eso si lo puedo asegurar.Temperatura.En lugares donde tengas ventilación y no en temperatura normal podrás notar que no se calienta, pero al andar en lugares donde no tengas ventilación y a temperatura normal vas a ver que si se calienta como cuando juegas con tu teléfono a brillo máximoHe leido algunas observaciones de lo que es el Oculus Quest 2 sobre lo que es que puede ser incomodoCosas que podrían ser desventaja?Pues el hecho de que requiere una cuenta obligatoria de Facebook para poder utilizarlo quizas para la mayoría dirá ""MEH tengo cuenta de Facebook"" pero recordemos que hay gente que no le gusta dicha plataforma y considero que pues no es necesario, igualmente la desventaja esta que las aplicaciones que hayas adquiridos se enlazan con dicha cuenta, si pierdes esa cuenta pierdes las aplicaciones. Y pues igual he leído algunas reseñas que dicen ""Me cree una cuenta de Facebook y a la semana me la bloquearon por que decían que era cuenta falsa y perdí todas las aplicaciones adquiridas"".Por otro lado el sujetador es de un material de plástico y tela que a largo plazo de utilidad es incomodo, por suerte se pueden comprar otros sujetadores mas cómodos.¿Como se conecta a la PC?Existen dos maneras la primera es usando AirLink que considero poco practico y problemático al menos de las veces que intente usar la pc, por otro lado puedes adquirir Virtual Desktop que cuesta 15 Dolares que pues igualmente lo mismo, pero este si es completamente practico. La segunda opción seria utilizando solo  un cable que sea de 3.0 o superior, que por lo menos con uno de un Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 pro me ha servido.Lo vale? Si honestamente lo vale por la cantidad de juegos gratuitos que puedes descargar tanto en la plataforma oculus o de sidequest o también jugando en la PC.OJO: La foto con el sujetador actual se compro por separado no es el original.

Got it on 25/01/2022. Writing this on 09/02/2022.TL;DR -Great headset. Absolutely worth the price. Buy paid games if you want to take full advantage of the Quest 2. There are other ways too to play a paid game as this is an android interface. My User ID in Eleven Table Tennsi is ZIGZAG@WII. find me there and we'll have a good match.Now, to those who really want to read this review,Pros.1. The moment you put it on, you'll want to stay in it and touch every part of the environment you're in. In some cases you can, in some you can't.2. Myth that the vision is blurry is true. But you'll find it's more than usable but not quite as sharp as any other more expensive VR headset like the Valve Index or the HP Reverb G2. But at this price point, it's the best you'll ever get!3. YouTube 360° is reaaallly good. Netflix's video quality is more than OK but not as sharp as you'll find on your phone at 1080p. Prime video is surprisingly better quality than that of Netflix.4. You'll find free games those are good for what they offer but paid games will blow your mind. Some of the examples are 1. Eleven Table Tennis (outstanding physics and totally realistic 97% of the times), 2. Beat Saber (it's the poster child of the Quest 2), 3. Pistol Whip ( makes you feel like a cowboy shooting targets in slo-mo and doing that to the beat!), 4. Zenith- The Last city (the closest we've come to a VR MMO like SAO)Cons.1. As I've written above, the blurry quality. Nothing we can do about it. Some YouTubes have found some settings to increase the quality and frame rate in developer mode but it resers everytime you turn off the Quest 2.2. The strap and the padding. There's always better ones out there so find them. In India, it's either pricey or impossible to get.3. You get a US flat pin charger in the box so use it with a 3-pin that supports it.4. I'd suggest you use the charger given in the box as there have been reports of the charging port melting due to excessive charging and what not.I will, if I can, edit this review in the future if I come across anything new. Beware of 5 star reviews as the seller gives Amazon gift cards in the box to give 5 star ratings. Other than that, the package arrived safely and on time so no problem there. Thanks for reading it so far. 🖖🏾

I was skeptical before buying this one as many had reviewed about blurriness and not enough IPD. Here is my experience:Pros.:1) Just amazing clarity in vision  and sound. Really immersive, takes you into a whole new world.2) Wireless. The big advantage of being able to play standalone games and pcvr via wifi.(You will need pcvr ready pc and wifi 6 though if you are thinking about pcvr otherwise there would be lot of lag). I don't play pcvr much and standalone games are great.3)Hand tracking is great feature. It's rather in experimental stage in my opinion as not many games or app use it but it will be popular in near future.4)Cheaper than other VR consoles. Even with great features, the price is reasonable.Cons.:1) the face interface could definitely use better foam and leather or synthetic covering.2) I have 3d printer so I got my self strap support for free which made it really comfortable to use. For those who don't have 3d printer, finding good quality elite strap would be a hassle and extra cost. Company could have provided that.3)Facebook login. You have to use fb account to use all the features of console. I think that could have been avoided, but we are already using Google account for everything in our phones so our privacy is already compromised. Still if you don't want to use your main fb account,  you make a new fb account and sign in via that one.4) The device has lot of potential for great AR use, but due to laws and set limitations there is not much development in AR and VR section.5) Though there are games available on sidequest to play for free, company should have made a few free games of their own rather than limiting to ""first steps"". You also need to take cost of buying games into account. But as I said there is a lot of free stuff on sidequest to keep you engaged.So overall I would recommend this to those who can accept the limitations of the device. And yes before buying, please check your inter pupillary distance (IPD), so that you know if it is OK for you to buy or not.

Very good VR headset in this price point. There are several points that could be improved. First, the screen door effect, it's quite a bit and that limits you immersion. Many reviews say that Quest 2 has almost no screen door effect, but I found it not to be true. It is less, but not completely gone. Field of View could be improved. And few other things. Otherwise it's a killer entry level VR headset.For me the best feature is the ability of play PC VR games wireless. I didn't use Quest 2 as standalone for two reasons. 1. The quality of PC VR is unmatched. 2. the same game which is available in Quest Store is at-least 3 times more expensive than steam counter part. With Oculus AirLink I can play every game nicely. There are few times when frames get dropped and that hinders game play, else mostly it's great. It could be my network gears as well. For Beat Saber it's too much (almost all the songs gets dropped frame resulting missing hits), and for other games it's there but you can live with it.This is a very good VR headset. If you can afford to buy HP reverb G2 as well, buy both, if you can afford to buy any of those, go for G2. Or if you buy Quest 2 only, you will still be having awesome time.

## Pros:- Cheap, Meta is selling at this price probably at a loss to attract more people. 128GB for around 33-35k is a great price.- Relatively higher resolution compared to a non-existent competition in this price range.- The quality of sensors is top notch. The tracking is extremely accurate.- It's relatively lightweight and can run off battery which means no cables. Very convenient and definitely the future direction.## Areas for improvement:- The displays could use OLED for better blacks. Though using OLED will hurt longevity so this one gets a pass. Currently blacks are like gray and that is something you will notice if you look for it.- The resolution could use an improvement. Again, it's an extremely competitive resolution for the price, but since it's so close to your eyes, even this feels pixelated and low res. It's early VR tech so expect that to improve with time.- The battery life is barely 2 hours on a full charge depending on what you're viewing. It's reasonably good, but in the future we could be looking at more efficient devices.- There should be a OS level simulated way to rotate when sitting still. It's tedious to have to get up just to rotate to other side of a 360 degree video. Allow simulating that via controls or something on OS level.- The headset strap is not comfortable for long wearing sessions. I should not have to spend more money to get a better quality strap. Wearing this device is a primary function and you shouldn't have to buy an accessory to make it better, regardless of the price. Only possible con I an think of, but it gets a pass this time.- On a related note, as this tech gets better, I expect components to shrink and this to get lighter and sleeker.- Would be nice to not have to create a Facebook account for this, but let's be honest, that's why they're selling this at a loss. To collect more customers and collect your data to target ads at you. That's how they make money, by selling ads and services.- Remotely installing apps from mobile is a hit or a miss. Most times it doesn't start downloading and I have to manually trigger app downloads. I think it's a temporary bug which they can easily fix.## Other notes:- Use Firefox reality browser. Way better than default and support ad blocking, multiple window and is also far more convenient and reliable with Web XR experiences.- Give Oculus TV a try. It's like YouTube VR but the interface is much nicer and the recommendations are also extremely good.- You can cast your Oculus view to your phone. This is super convenient when showing this to a friend or family member. Just cast to your phone so that you have a sense of what your friend/family member is seeing and guide them accordingly.## Summary:Great stuff honestly. Making VR affordable (regardless of the intentions) also opens it up to more developers across the world and that will only help give us better VR experiences over time. Looking forward to develop some WebXR and native oculus experiences using this.

Mucha gente tiene la duda sobre si comprar o no las Quest 2 para poder jugar a juegos como el Pavlov, el Subnautica, SuperHOT, Half Life Alyx, etc.Si, si se puede, y es muy recomendable, pero antes que nada, estas gafas de VR a diferencia de las primeras que lanzó Oculus, no son solo dos monitores y ya, es una consola.Una de las mayores ventajas que yo le veo a las Quest 2 es su modo inalámbrico, o el modo que viene por defecto. Si bien el consumo de batería en este modo es, pues, importante, los gráficos que podemos apreciar no solo no están mal, son lo suficientemente buenos para mantener un frame-rate adecuado, y una inmersión muy buena, y todo esto sin necesidad de una PC.Los altavoces que vienen incluidos son bastante buenos, están muy bien direccionados y no se ven afectados en gran medida por el ruido ambiente a menos que tengas una cantidad criminal de ruido ambiente cerca de ti, en cuyo caso se pueden usar audífonos cableados por un jack de 3.5mm, y también recomendaría buscar un lugar que no tenga tanto ruido ambiente, así es como te da tinnitus.Yo recomiendo revisar la Store de Oculus desde su página si planteas nunca conectar las gafas a una PC, seleccionar varios juegos que te gusten y considerar si son suficientes para realizar la compra. Spoiler: los juegos de la Oculus Store son todo, menos baratos.De igual forma, Oculus nos ofrece dos formas de conectar nuestras gafas a una PC para poder jugar, ya sea juegos de la tienda de Steam, o juegos de la tienda de Oculus directo al PC (esto para obtener mejores gráficos y mayor framerate): Air Link y Link.El AirLink funciona vía wireless, y es la única que he usado. Si tu internet tiende a presentar intermitencias por más cortas que estas sean, o si tu PC tiene problemas con tener muchas aplicaciones abiertas, quizá el Link sea la mejor opción, en cuyo caso, tienes la opción de conectarlo vía USBC-USBC, o vía USB3.1-USBC, y por las reseñas y opiniones que he podido ver, ambas opciones funcionan casi igual: latencia extremadamente baja, consumo de batería decente en el caso del Air Link, posibilidad de manipular la PC desde las gafas, y gráficos bastante buenos.Si tienes un poco de dinero que te sobre y quieres experimentar cosas nuevas relacionadas al gaming, son la mejor opción, eso si, por su precio regular, ni se les ocurra comprar las versiones de 128GB en 9,000 pesos o más, pueden comprar las Quest 2 en su precio normal, 2 a 3 juegos en la tienda de Oculus o de Steam y el cable Link de 5 o 10 metros por los 9,000 pesos que cuestan las gafas por temporadas, lo mejor siempre es estar revisando los precios.

Después de días enteros de lidiar con el soporte de FacebookOculus, me vienen diciendo que se debe proceder a una garantía por defecto del puerto USB-C de mi headset Quest 2. Después de pedirme tanta información, hacer que desinstalara programas en mi PC, e instalara algunos otros para hacer sus pruebas, después de todo lo que tuve que soportar para que me dieran una solución, me salen con que el defecto esta en el visor pero que no tienen garantía para México. Jamás volveré a comprar algo que sea de Facebook. Procederé a levantar mi reclamación con amazon para ver que solución me pueden dar.

The order was placed on 21 October 2021, and received on 25 October - 4 days to be shipped from USA to Singapore! Amazon Prime membership has it's perks.The Oculus box was well packed and protected, and in impeccable condition.After setting up the pre-requisite Facebook account, the first images on the headset were astounding. The screen was clear, and sound from the built in speakers better than expected. The demo games I downloaded so far were Saber Beat and Superhot, both were entirely immersive.VR headsets has improved tremendously in the last few years, and for USD299, it's a bargain. I would highly recommend the Quest 2 to anyone.

Eu já conhecia o dispositivo de VR da Samsung. Era muito bom, embora necessitasse do celular para funcionar. Infelizmente a Samsung descontinuou o produto. Felizmente o FACEBOOK resolveu assumir a Oculus e o resultado foi um produto primoroso.  A imersão é bastante convincente (você se esquece, muitas vezes, de que se trata de uma simulação, tal o realismo das imagens e o do oferecidos). Trata-se de uma experiência que eu recomendo, fortemente. :-)

No esperaba que fuera así de bueno, tenía mis dudas, ya que necesita una cuenta de Facebook para poder usarlo, pero todo bien hasta ahora, se siente increíble, cada que los uso me sigue impresionando, lo recomiendo 100%Lo único malo que tiene, es que el soporte para la cabeza se vuelve muy incómodo después de un rato, y que el sistema operativo que tiene suele fallar y ya sea que se congele la imagen o que se traben los menús y tarden en responder, (eso no pasa cuando lo usas conectado a la PC), no siempre pasa, pero suele pasar e incómoda un poco.Fuera de eso, todo excelente, si estás empezando en el mundo del VR igual que yo, definitivamente estos son los que debes tener.

El dispositivo es nuevo, caja en perfectas condiciones, me gustó que añadieron un protector facial de silicón que por lo que leo normalmente no viene incluído y es de los comentarios más mencionados (la pieza original absorbe sudor y con el aditamento esto no pasa) recomiendo encarecidamente conseguir el adaptador para la nuca o la correa para la cabeza  para hacer la experiencia más cómoda, en general por la cantidad de aplicaciones (gratuitas de paga demos y versiones beta) disponibles el dispositivo vale mucho más del valor de venta sin tener que gastar más. Altamente recomendable buscar los tutoriales y recomendaciones en youtube para evitar dañor o banneos con y del dispositivo.

La experiencia del VR es única, no esperen ver gráficos super buenos de forma nativa, a menos que lo conecten a una PC muy potente. Pero de manera independiente el oculus ofrece una experiencia única, jugar sin cables ayuda muchísimo a la inmersión, de plano te desconectas del mundo exterior y vives los videojuegos!. El único detalle es que la batería es insuficiente para sesiones largas de juego, pero aún así estoy muy contento con mi compra, lo recomiendo totalmente, en especial a quienes no han tenido un acercamiento con el VR.

Bem-acabado, desenvolvido, embalagem perfeita, funciona muito bem.Para jogos com mais detalhes gráficos ou mais pesados, recomendo o uso do como de dados. Para algo mais casual, ou mais simples, o Air Link funciona muito bem. Existe todo um conjunto de recomendações para o Air Link, que é usar 100% sem fios, vale ler o material no site do Oculus Quest 2 para se familiarizar com as necessidades básicas. Já adianto: um roteador AC1200 é o mínimo para operar.

I had been using this for almost a month before writing a review. This VR headset is an all in one headset, it can be operate like a smartphone without connecting to a pc.Future owners who confused on the storage capacity selection there are few tips here. 128 GB is already sufficient for me to store around 15 apps with some additional storage left. 256 GB might be a better choice for you if you have tons of files to store in the VR headset without planning to remove it.I have a larger head with spectacles, the original straps will be too tight for me. Even if I am not, I highly recommend the new user to own a straps too, it is way more comfortable when you are wearing it.

Las oculus funcionan de maravilla, la manera en que detecta el entorno es de lo mejor que he visto en lentes de realidad virtual, además de que ya no se necesita una pc super potente para correr los juegos es lo mejor, la batería es corta pero considero que te llega a las dos horas y media y el strap que tanto critican yo no le tengo ningún pero, si pudiera ser mejor pero no es nada del otro mundo. Como son blancas se ensucian un montón, no importa si tienes las manos limpias pasan los días y tanto como los controles y el visor ya van a estar sucio, además de que las straps son dificilísimos de limpiar. Lo realmente malo de este producto es que los juegos son excesivamente caros a comparación de un PC, hablo de que en ocasiones le suben hasta un 40% el costo del juego a comparación de comprarlo en computadora, por lo que si tienes una pc buena lo razonable es comprar el cable de 5 metros y comprar los juegos en la pc pero esa idea de stan alone ya se elimina por completo que era su principal diferenciador. También si existe un cataloga de unos 40 a 50 juegos muy top, pero que son juegos que en 1 día los terminas y por lo que pagas hasta aveces no sientes que valgan la pena, y también existen juegos muy meh que no valen la pena, siento yo que les hace falta un filtro de juegos mas bueno. Para ver videos, netflix y ese tipo de apps realmente si tienes una inmersión mejor que solamente verlo en pantalla.

O Produto é ótimo, cumpre mais do que promete, pois te dá uma imersão na VR fora do real. Para quem já utilizou outros VR's, vai se surpreender com esse. Recomendo pesquisarem bem no YouTube, assistir vídeos pois é um investimento alto, mas que para quem gosta, vale cada centavo. Não dei 5 estrelas, apesar de merecer, mais por uma questão de ser verdadeiro sobre a qualidade geral do produto. A durabilidade dele vai depender do quanto de cuidado você terá, pois ele se apresenta frágil, ou seja, uma queda pode danificar, mas tomando cuidados, é uma ótima diversão. Sua bateria dura cerca de 2 hrs, o bastante para cansar uma pessoa, mas se você estiver em Grupo de Amigos, a bateria vai fazer falta, recomendo um upgrade de bateria externa ou powerbank com um cabo. Custo benefício é outro ponto complicado, além do preço do produto ser alto, se prepare para comprar jogos em Dólares, jogos bons por volta de 19 dólares e jogos mais requintados entre 24 e 30 dólares, então é um investimento que tem que se levar em consideração. Se os preços não te assustam, compre e seja feliz, porque vale a pena, principalmente para roda de família e amigos. E ultima recomendação, recomendo ter um ChromeCast ou similar para transmitir na TV, pois daí todos assistem o que vc está assistindo, risadas garantidas.

Received the latest manufactured device dated March 22. Really happy with the seller sending me the latest model which has no defects.Initially I had some doubts about the lens being defected due to the corners, edges having some dots. I dont know what they are could be to stick the lens to the frame.Might take some time to know the best IPD setting, first I had it set on 2 but wasn't happy with the blurry vision then changed to 3 and now it's all clear.Seller is genuine and if you are planning to purchase, purchase it.It might take a little while to set yourself from the vection, as you feel the motion sickness in games which has continuous movement. But you can get used to it slowly.Overall I am really enjoying Oculus Quest 2.Must try Apps:Horizon Venues,Multiverse.

Es un gran preducto.. bastante imersivo.. si ya has usado unos VR antes entonces te gustaran bastante por lo facil de usar, pero si es la primera vez y esperas ver el mayor avance tecnológico en entretenimiento... bueno en algunos aspectos podria ser. Visualmente se ve bastante bien.. pero no se ve comoletamente nitido, no es por que este dañado sino es la tecnologia que se tiene.. el sonido es bastante bueno!.. para rl tamaño de bocinas, es bastante nitido el sonido y los bajos son buenos... Es mejor usar unos audifonos claroo.. pero para la comidad de no traer audifonos es bastante bueno.Recomendacion... Si lo vas a usar en seciones largas te recomiendo completamente pensar en invertir en un strap elite mejor que el que  lleva por defecto, no es incomoda la que tiene pero en seciones largas si es un poco molesto afemas que es dificil ajustarla exactamente para que no tengas defectos visuales al usarlo.

Pros first.Videos and games look very real.There are some animations that are awesome.Guardian boundry is a good concept. Keeps you inside a safe boundry in VR.You can enable option to see an outline of someone enters your guardian boundry... Helps.The device looks durable. I one smashed the controller in the wall. It saved my hand, also nothing happened to it.Works standalone. You can take it to your friends and family and let them experience it also.Cons.Resolution could be better.Content is there... But still not much or enough as of now.The straps have to be adjusted each time you wear it.Gets very hot inside the device. I sweat like crazy and it gets blurry after some time may be because of water vapour condensing on the lens.OverallI'm playing Resident evil 4, experience is very good overall. Also installed blade and sorcery, it's good experience, but the game does not have story mode yet, just some arenas to fight with some enemies. Overall a very good experience till now. I will try to get the cable and connect to pc and try the pc VR games next, PC needs to be upgraded though. Five stars to the product.

A experiência de poder jogar na realidade virtual com o seus amigos, ou ver videos, filmes e séries, é surpreendentemente incrivel! estou completamente apaixonada pelo Oculus quest 2, mas infelizmente nem tudo é perfeito. A bateria do oculus dura em torno de 2 a 3 horas, (depende do que você pretende fazer, e suas configurações), infelizmente é bem pouco tempo para os viciados nessa experiência, mas eu já tinha ciência dessa parte antes de comprar. Mas o problema que realmente está me incomodando é o fato do analogico do controle esquerdo começou a se mover sozinho e bugar em alguns jogos, isso estraga bastante a experiência.

Debo comenzar por decir que sí son sorprendentes. Te imaginas cómo serán, pero al probarlos realmente supera tus expectativas. Al paso de los días ya comienzas a normalizar esa tecnología e incluso puedes llegar a pensar en aspectos a mejorar (como los gráficos, los cuales, por cierto, son los que deben ser para el precio en el que están las gafas).Compré las gafas porque quería hacer un escritorio virtual con muchos monitores. Aunque se supone que ya hay como 3 apps que lo hacen, en realidad no se logra eso tan sencillamente y lamentablemente los desarrolladores no te dicen la causa precisa, sino que te tienes que ir dando cuenta por qué no se puede tan fácilmente (llevo alrededor de 20 horas netas investigando y, aunque aún no lo descubro con certeza, creo que ha sido porque la tarjeta gráfica de mi computadora no es apta para sus gafas y otra razón es el internet que no sé por qué pero en las gafas falla más que en una computadora, me falta también probar apps de paga, pero me preocupa pagar por ellas y que tampoco funcionen)

I received my oculus quest 2 few days and it is amazing. I was hesitant to buy it first because I never owned a VR headset but once I tried it on, those feelings went away. The amount of technology facebook managed to build into this is amazing. It has a flagship processor, 4 cameras with tracking tech, 2 1080p screen and 2 tracking hand controllers. As someone who loves technology, this is unheard of in this price range. The closest thing is the HTC VIVE VR headset and it close 3 times as much with more complicated set up. I would suggest anyone who loves tech to buy this thing. Just make sure your IPD is in the range of this headset or else the vision will be blurry.P.S. If you do not like facebook or their practices, stay away from this headset because everything you do will be through your facebook account.

O produto chegou com um dia de atraso, mas o prazo de entrega não era tão relevante para mim. Veio bem embalado e protegido, produto de ótima qualidade e sem defeitos. Pelo pouco que já usei, eu sei que vou viciar hahahaha os jogos da store são salgados (entre 9,99 e 39,99 dólares em média, que bom q o dólar desvalorizou um pouco rsrs), mas tem tmb os jogos gratuitos (alguns oferecem uma demo, por exemplo). Toda minha família já testou e amou! A imersão é absurda e cativante, sem arrependimentos ❣️Um dos únicos pontos negativos é a bateria, não dura mais que três horas infelizmente.

Produto entregue pela Total Express, demorou chegar pois passou por fiscalização aduaneira entretanto como já foi importado não me cobraram nenhuma taxa. Chegou mal embalado e com a caixa amassada, fiquei com medo de não funcionar. O produto em si chegou intacto e até agora funciona bem. Possui um sistema operacional próprio com jogos e aplicativos em realidade virtual e também possui a opção de conectar a um computador, porém o computador precisa ter uma capacidade gráfica boa para proporcionar uma experiência satisfatória. É muito divertido de usar e muito bom para se divertir com outras pessoas, pois possui capacidade de espelhar o que é visto pelo usuário em um navegador web. O único óculos de RV viável no Brasil.

El Oculus Quest 2 es una de las mejores adquisiciones tecnológicas que he hecho en los últimos años.Un excelente producto para iniciarte en la Realidad Virtual. Es inalámbrico y la resolución increíble!La variedad de juegos y aplicaciones es muy vasta para comenzar a iniciarse en este ámbito y el que además pueda conectarse a una PC Gamer de manera inalámbrica hace que las posibilidades de diversión y desarrollo se multipliquen aún más. Los gráficos jugando con el Oculus conectado a una PC Gamer son todavía aún  mejores, pero aún así, sin utlilizar una PC, existen muchas aplicaciones y juegos cuya experiencia visual es fantástica.  El Oculus Quest 2 es una opción definitivamente muy recomendable!

Great product from Oculus. The best VR device in the market right now. 128 gb will be enough for a regular user. And there are so many apps to explore and so many 360 video based content.Only con is that after buying you'll still have to pay for exploring any good app from Meta. So it's not like your purchases will end after buying this device.

I received this product earlier than expected delivery date and the product condition was new and intact. The outer Amazon box packaging can be improved.I'm enjoying quest 2 as a standalone headset and the content on the store is amazing, but we need a credit card with transactions enabled and 2 factor authentication disabled to make any purchases from quest store. Its airlink feature works seamlessly like you are actually running the pcvr over the cable. Best wireless connectivity I've seen so far on any device. Will post a long-term review soon.

Muito bom, porém infelizmente acabei tendo problema de drift nos analógio, procurei e vi que muitos tem, geralmente ocorre por conta de poeira e a solução é limpa contato. Esse problema pode ocorrer com qualquer analógico então paciência rsrs.A bateria dura em media 30-1h depende do uso, recomendo que compre o bobo vr m2  com bateria(Não tem tanto conforto o que vem) caso for jogar pela bateria, é caro, mais para quem comprou o fone  que já é absurdo haha.A utilização via Cabo(não rola com o cabo que vem) o cabo que bem nele não é USB e é bem curto, para conseguir utilizar de boa precisa ser 3.2 o USB, em teste no 3.0 a bateria dura muito mais, porém não carrega durante uso.

Achei ele desconfortável, pesa muito na cabeça, me deu dor de cabeça depois de poucos minutos, embaça fácil a tela, tela com cores “mortas” e os pretos meio acinzentados, regulagem de IPD muito limitada.

Todo bien, es un buen producto, aunque la batería dura poco y tarda más en cargar.El motivo principal para comprarlo fue para ver películas en bigscreen o en otra plataforma que me diera la sensación de estar en el cine, lamentablemente los videos y películad se ven en baja calidad, y es cansado tener el visor puesto para ver contenido multimedia. En cambio los juegos se disfrutan más que ver videos o otro tipo de contenido.

While the device is easy to setup. There is alot of improvements needed. First the device can't fit with my glasses. Wearing it is pretty heavy , after 20mins it's really tiring to wear longer. Only the centre of your view point is sharp, if u move your eyesight without moving yout head u will notice the images are blurred. Not good for eyes if u wear longer. I am very disappointed that there is no std cable to the pc. An additional link cable cost a whopping 99dollar. And the game store has very little games, the better games are on steam. For a $500 purchase, I rather buy a ps5 or a Nintendo switch.....

Después de eliminar unos zombies, corté cajas con mis katanas y regresé a mi casa a jugar con mi Oculus Quest 2. Ya en serio. Si tienes Pc esta versión te conviene, ya que al reproducir los juegos en la computadora no necesitas el espacio del visor y te ahorras unos dineros. La inmersión es buena y el audio sorprende. Al ser blanco se ensucia con facilidad, tanto el plástico como las tiras de tela. El AirLink (Conexión remota) es decente y se está mejorando. Se recomienda el cable link y/o un buen modem exclusivo para el Oculus, pero eso ya es inversión para mejorar la experiencia.

Por su precio es una excelente inversión si quieres empezar en VR, tiene buen espacio, es barato, no necesitas equipamiento extra, buen catalogo de juegos y en general muy bueno.Algunos problemas que me he encontrado sin embargo es que para el juego VRchat este visor no es el mejor (Es un juego social, en este juego es posible mover el cuerpo entero con otros visores, con el Quest 2 solo la cabeza y manos). No se pueden ver peliculas acostado, cosa que hubiera estado genial. A veces el seguimiento falla en algunos juegos. Es un poco entretenido ver que opción de IPD es la que mejor se te acomoda, y tienes que tener el visor quieto para poder ver bien en vez de ligeramente borroso.En conclusión, un visor genial, solo necesitas invertir un poco en una correa nueva para la cabeza.

Você entra no jogo, cada passo dado é pensado.CONTRA: Bateria dura em média 2 horas (alguns jogos você se cansa antes de acabar a bateria, mas outros você precisa deixar carregando para continuar).

El producto es bueno, en mi caso no es adecuado por que aunque tiene adaptador para gafas , la verdad resulta muy incómodo y castigante en el área de los pómulos, e  invertir en las lentes, seria un gasto adicional que no haría, los juegos no se ven como dicen y tienen muchos  fallos,  es una versión que se irá puliendo con el tiempo.
